Jawara / Gambia (The)\nSummary of Facts\nCommunication 147/95\n1. The Complainant is the former Head of State of the Republic of The Gambia. He alleges that after the\nMilitary coup of July 1994, that overthrew his government, there has been \"blatant abuse of power by ... the\nmilitary junta\". The military government is alleged to have initiated a reign of terror, intimidation and\narbitrary detention.\n2. The Complainant further alleges the abolition of the Bill of Rights as contained in the 1970 Gambian\nConstitution by Military Decree No. 30/31, ousting the competence of the courts to examine or question the\nvalidity of any such decree.\n3. The communication alleges the banning of political parties and of ministers of the former civilian\ngovernment from taking part in any political activity. The communication alleges restrictions on freedom of\nexpression, movement and religion. These restrictions were manifested, according to the complainant, by\nthe arrest and detention of people without charge, kidnappings, torture and the burning of a mosque.\n4. He further alleges that two former Ministers of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC)\nwere killed by the regime, asserting that the restoration of the death penalty through Decree No. 52 means,\n\"the arsenal of the AFPRC is now complete\".\n5. He also alleges that not less than fifty soldiers were killed in cold blood and buried in mass graves by the\nmilitary government during what the Complainant terms \"a staged-managed attempted coup\". Several\nmembers of the armed forces were allegedly detained (some for up to six months), without trial, following\nthe introduction of Decree No. 3 of July 1994. This Decree gives the Minister of Interior the power to detain\nand to extend the period of detention ad infinitum. The Decree further prohibits the proceedings of habeas\ncorpus on any detention issued under it.\n6. The Complainant alleges further that Decree No. 45 of June 1995, the National Intelligence Agency (NIA)\nDecree empowers the Minister of Interior or his designate to issue search warrants, authorise interference\nwith correspondence, be it wireless or electronic.\n7. Finally, the communication alleges disregard for the judiciary and contempt of court following the\nregime's disregard of a court order; the imposition of retroactive legislation following the Economic Crimes\n(Specified Offences) Decree of 25th November 1994, thus infringing on the rule and the due process of law.\nCommunication 149/96\n8. Communication 149/96 alleges violation of the right to life, freedom from torture and the right to a fair\ntrial. The Complainant alleges that not less than fifty soldiers have been summarily executed by the\nGambian military government and buried in mass graves following an alleged attempted coup on 11th\nNovember 1994.\n9. The Complainant attaches the names of thirteen of the fifty soldiers alleged to have been killed and\nfurther alleges that a former Finance Minister, Mr Koro Ceesay was killed by the government. He attaches\na document from a former member of the AFPRC, Captain Sadibu Hydara, to support this allegation.\n10. He went further to state that a former AFPRC member and former Interior Minister did not die from high\nblood pressure as claimed by the government but was tortured to death.\nThe Government's Response\n11. In its submission on the question of admissibility, the government raised the following objections:\n12. The first point raised is what the government called lack of 'proofs in support', claiming that a\ncommunication should only be received by the Commission if the individual alleges, 'with proofs in support'\na serious or massive case of violations of human and peoples' rights.\n13. The government asserts that the decrees complained of may on their face value be seen to be contrary\nto the provisions in the Charter, but claims that they must be \"studied and placed in the context of the\nchanged circumstances in The Gambia\". Commenting on the freedom of liberty, the government claimed it\nwas acting in conformity with laws previously laid down by domestic legislation. The government claims that\n1\n\n\fthe decrees do not prohibit the enjoyment of freedoms; they are merely there to secure peace and stability,\nand only those who want to disrupt the peace will be arrested and detained.\n14. The submission further claims that since the take-over, not a single individual has been deliberately\nkilled; and that during the counter - coup of 11th November 1994, soldiers of both sides lost their lives due\nmainly to the fact that the rebels were fighting back with soldiers loyal to the government.\n15. The government also claims that Mr Koro Ceesay and Mr Sadibu Hydara alleged to have been killed by\nthe government died from an accident and natural causes, respectively. Post-mortem reports on the two\ndeaths are attached.\n16. The government further pointed out that the communication does not fulfil some of the conditions laid\ndown in Article 56 of the Charter. Specifically, that the communications fails to meet the conditions set\ndown in sub-article 4 and Article 56(5), which state that communications:\nArticle 56(4)...are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media;\nArticle 56(5)...are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any unless it is obvious that this procedure is\nunduly prolonged.\n\nComplaint\n17. The Complainant alleges violation of the following Articles of the Charter: Articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7(1)(d),\n7(2), 9(1), 9(2), 10(1), 11, 12(1), 12(2), 20(1) and 26.\n\nProcedure\n18. Communication 147/95 is dated 6th September 1995 and was received on 30th November 1995 at the\nSecretariat of the Commission.\n19. Communication 149/96 was received on 12th January 1996 at the Secretariat of the Commission.\n20. At the 19th Session in March 1996, the Commission decided to be seized of the communication and to\nnotify the government accordingly, and stated that a decision on admissibility would be taken at the 20th\nSession in October 1996.\n21. At its 21st Session in April 1997, the Commission decided to renumber the communication as 147/95 to\nreflect the length of time it has been with the Commission, it also decided to join the communication with\n149/96 and declare both of them admissible. The Commission also requested further information from both\nsides and stated that a decision on the merits would be taken at its 22nd Session.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n22. Article 56 of the African Charter governs the admissibility of communications by the Commission. This\narticle lays down seven conditions that, under normal circumstances must be fulfilled for a communication\nto be admissible. Have the seven, the government claims that two conditions have not been fulfilled;\nnamely; Article 56(4) and 56(5).\n23. Article 56(4) of the Charter provides that communications '... are not based exclusively on news\ndisseminated through the mass media'.\n24. The government claims that the communication should be declared inadmissible because it is based\nexclusively on news disseminated through the mass media, and specifically made reference to the attached\nletter of Captain Ebou Jallow. While it would be dangerous to rely exclusively on news disseminated from\nthe mass media, it would be equally damaging if the Commission were to reject a communication because\nsome aspects of it are based on news disseminated through the mass media. This is borne out of the fact\nthat the Charter makes use of the word \"exclusively\".\n25. There is no doubt that the media remains the most important, if not the only source of information. It is\ncommon knowledge that information on human rights violations is always gotten from the media. The\ngenocide in Rwanda, the human rights abuses in Burundi, Zaire, Congo, to name but a few, were revealed\nby the media.\n2\n\n\f26. The issue therefore should not be whether the information was gotten from the media, but whether the\ninformation is correct. Did the Complainant try to verify the truth about these allegations? Did he have the\nmeans or was it possible for him to do so, given the circumstances of his case?\n27. The communication under consideration cannot be said to be based exclusively on news disseminated\nthrough the mass media because the communication is not exclusively based on Captain Jallow's letter.\nThe Complainant alleges extra-judicial execution and has attached the names of some of those he alleges\nhave been killed. Captain Jallow's letter made no mention of this fact.\n28. Article 56(5) of the Charter states that communications '... are sent after exhausting local remedies, if\nany, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged'.\n29. The government also claims that the author has not attempted to exhaust local remedies. The\ngovernment claims that the author should have sent his complaint to the police who would in turn have\ninvestigated the allegations and prosecuted the offenders 'in a court of law'.\n30. This rule is one of the most important conditions for admissibility of communications, there is no doubt\ntherefore, that in almost all the cases, the first requirement looked at by both the Commission and the state\nconcerned is the exhaustion of local remedies.\n31. The rationale of the local remedies rule both in the Charter and other international instruments is to\nensure that before proceedings are brought before an international body, the State concerned must have\nhad the opportunity to remedy the matter through its own local system. This prevents the Commission from\nacting as a court of first instance rather than a body of last resort.1 Three major criteria could be deduced\nfrom the practice of the Commission in determining this rule, namely: the remedy must be available,\neffective and sufficient.\n32. A remedy is considered available if the petitioner can pursue it without impediment, it is deemed\neffective if it offers a prospect of success, and it is found sufficient if it is capable of redressing the\ncomplaint.\n33. The government's assertion of non-exhaustion of local remedies will therefore be looked at in this light.\nAs aforementioned, a remedy is considered available only if the applicant can make use of it in the\ncircumstance of his case. The applicants in cases Nos. ACHPR/60/91, ACHPR/87/93, ACHPR/101/93\nand ACHPR/129/94 had their communications declared admissible by the Commission because the\ncompetence of the ordinary courts had been ousted either by decrees or the establishment of special\ntribunals.\n34. The Commission has stressed that, remedies, the availability of which is not evident, cannot be invoked\nby the State to the detriment of the complainant. Therefore, in a situation where the jurisdiction of the courts\nhave been ousted by decrees whose validity cannot be challenged or questioned, as is the position with the\ncase under consideration, local remedies are deemed not only to be unavailable but also non- existent.\n35. The existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing\nwhich, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Therefore, if the applicant cannot turn to the\njudiciary of his country because of generalised fear for his life (or even those of his relatives), local\nremedies would be considered to be unavailable to him.\n36. The Complainant in this case had been overthrown by the military, he was tried in absentia, former\nMinisters and Members of Parliament of his government have been detained and there was terror and fear\nfor lives in the country. It would be an affront to common sense and logic to require the Complainant to\nreturn to his country to exhaust local remedies.\n37. There is no doubt that there was a generalised fear perpetrated by the regime as alleged by the\nComplainant. This created an atmosphere not only in the mind of the author but also in the minds of right\nthinking people that returning to his country at that material moment, for whatever reason, would be risky to\nhis life. Under such circumstances, domestic remedies cannot be said to have been available to the\ncomplainant.\n38. According to the established case law of the Commission, a remedy that has no prospect of success\ndoes not constitute an effective remedy. The prospect of seizing the national courts, whose jurisdiction\nhave been ousted by decrees, in order to seek redress is nil. This fact is reinforced by the government's\nresponse of 8th March 1996, Note Verbale No. PA 203/232/01/(97-ADJ), in which it stated that 'The\nGambian Government...does not intend to spend valuable time responding to baseless and frivolous\nallegations by a deposed despot...'\n39. As to whether there were sufficient remedies, one can deduce from the above analysis that there were\nno remedies capable of redressing the complaints of the authors.\n\n3\n\n\f40. Considering the fact that the regime at that material time controlled all the arms of government and had\nlittle regard for the judiciary, as was demonstrated by its disregard of a court order in the T. K Motors' case,\nand considering further that the Court of Appeal of The Gambia in the case of Pa Salla Jagne v The State,\nruled that 'Now there are no human rights laws or goals and objective laws in the country', it would be\nreversing the clock of justice to request the Complainant to attempt local remedies.\n41. It should also be noted that the government also claims that the communication lacks 'proofs in\nsupport'. The position of the Commission has always been that a communication must establish a prima\nfacie evidence of violation. It must specify the provisions of the Charter alleged to have been violated. The\nstate also claims that the Commission is allowed under the Charter to take action only on cases that reveal\na series of serious or massive violations of human rights.\n42. This is an erroneous proposition. Apart from Article 47 and Article 49 of the Charter, which empower the\nCommission to consider inter-state complaints, Article 55 of the Charter provides for the consideration of\n\"communications other than those of States Parties\". Further to this, Article 56 of the Charter stipulates the\nconditions for consideration of such communications (see also Chapter XVII[sic] of the Rules of Procedure\nentitled \"Procedure for the Consideration of The Communications Received in Conformity with Article 55 of\nthe Charter\"). In any event, the practice of the Commission has been to consider communications even if\nthey do not reveal a series of serious or massive violations. It is out of such useful exercise that the\nCommission has, over the years, been able to build up its case law and jurisprudence.\n43. The argument that the action of the government is in conformity with regulations previously laid down\nby law is unfounded: the Commission decided in its decision on communication 101/93, with respect to\nfreedom of association, that, \"competent authorities should not enact provisions which limit the exercise of\nthis freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional provisions or undermine\nfundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution and international human rights standards\". And more\nimportantly, the Commission in its Resolution on the Right to Freedom of Association had also reiterated\nthat: \"The regulation of the exercise of the right to freedom of association should be consistent with States'\nobligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights\". It follows that any law, which is\npleaded for curtailing the enjoyment of any of the rights provided for in the Charter, must meet this\nrequirement.\n\nFor these reasons, the Commission declared the communications admissible.\nMerits\n44. The Complainant alleges that by suspending the Bill of Rights in the 1970 Gambian Constitution, the\ngovernment violated Articles 1 and 2 of the African Charter.\n45. Article 1 of the Charter provides that \"The Member States ... parties to the present Charter shall\nrecognise the rights, duties and freedoms enshrined in this Charter...\", while Article 2 reads: \"Every\nindividual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognised and guaranteed in the\npresent Charter...\".\n46. Article 1 gives the Charter the legally binding character always attributed to international treaties of this\nsort. Therefore a violation of any provision of the Charter automatically means a violation of Article 1. If a\nState party to the Charter fails to recognise the provisions of the same, there is no doubt that it is in\nviolation of this Article. Its violation, therefore, goes to the root of the Charter.\n47. The Republic of the Gambia ratified the Charter on 6th June 1983. In its first periodic report to the\nCommission in 1992, the Gambian government asserted that \"Most of the rights set out in the Charter have\nbeen provided for in Chapter 3, Sections 13 to 30 of the 1970 Constitution...The Constitution predicts the\nGambian accession to the covenants, but in fact gave legal effect to some of the provisions of the Charter\".\nThis therefore means that the Gambian government gave recognition to some of the provisions of the\nCharter (i.e. those contained in chapter 3 of its Constitution), and incorporated them into its domestic law.\n48. By suspending Chapter 3, (the Bill of Rights), the government therefore restricted the enjoyment of the\nrights guaranteed therein, and, by implication, the rights enshrined in the Charter.\n49. It should however be stated that the suspension of the Bill of Rights does not ipso facto mean the\nsuspension of the domestic effect of the Charter. In Communication 129/94, the Commission held that \"the\nobligation of ... a government remains unaffected by the purported revocation of the domestic effect of the\n4\n\n\fCharter\".\n50. The suspension of the Bill of Rights and consequently the application of the Charter was not only a\nviolation of Article 1 but also a restriction on the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms enshrined in the\nCharter, thus violating Article 2 of the Charter as well.\n51. Article 4 of the Charter states that \"Every human being shall be entitled to respect for his life and the\nintegrity of his person. No one may be arbitrarily deprived of this right''.\n52. While the Complainant alleges that there have been extra-judicial killings, no concrete evidence was\nadduced to support this allegation. The military government has provided official post-mortem reports on\nthe causes of the deaths of Messrs. Koro Ceesay and Sadibu Hydara. The government does not dispute\nthe fact that soldiers died during the counter coup in November 1994, but claims, \"soldiers of both sides lost\ntheir lives due mainly to the fact that the rebels were fighting back with soldiers loyal to the government\". It\nalso claims that since the take-over, not a single individual has been deliberately killed.\n53. It is not for the Commission to verify the authenticity of the post-mortem reports or the truth of the\ngovernment's defence. The burden is on the Complainant to furnish the Commission with evidence of his\nallegations. In the absence of concrete proof, the Commission cannot hold the latter to be in violation of\nArticle 4 of the Charter.\n54. Article 5 of the Charter reads: \"... All forms of ... torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and\ntreatment shall be prohibited\".\n55. The Complainant alleges that the military perpetrated a reign of terror, intimidation and torture when it\nseized power. While there is evidence of intimidation, arrests and detentions, there is no independent\nreport of torture.\n56. The Complainant further alleges that detention of persons incommunicado and preventing them from\nseeing their relatives constitutes torture. The State has refuted this claim and has challenged the\nComplainant to verify the truth from those who were detained. To date, the Commission has received no\nevidence from the complainant. In the absence of proof therefore, the Commission cannot hold the\ngovernment to be in violation of Article 5. In this regard, the Commission is relying on its decision in\ncommunication ACHPR/60/91: 27 [sic]* where it held that \" without specific information as to the nature of\nthe acts themselves, the Commission is thus unable to find a violation of Article 5\".\n57. Article 6 of the Charter reads: \"Every individual shall have the right to liberty and to the security of his\nperson. No one may be deprived of this freedom except for reasons and conditions previously laid down by\nlaw. In particular, no one may be arbitrarily arrested\".\n58. The Military government has not refuted the allegations of arbitrary arrests and detentions, but has\ndefended its position by stating that, its action must be \"studied and placed in the context of the changed\ncircumstances in The Gambia\". It also claims that it is acting within the confines of legislation 'previously\nlaid down by law', as required by the wordings of Article 6 of the Charter.\n59. The Commission in its decision on communication 101/93 laid down a general principle with respect to\nfreedom of association that \"competent authorities should not enact provisions which limit the exercise of\nthis freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional provisions or undermine\nfundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution or international human rights standards\" . This principle\ntherefore applies not only to freedom of association but also to all other rights and freedoms. For a State to\navail itself of this plea, it must show that such a law is consistent with its obligations under the Charter. The\nCommission finds the arrests and incommunicado detention of the aforementioned persons inconsistent\nwith Gambia's obligations under the Charter. They constitute arbitrary deprivation of their liberty and thus a\nviolation of Article 6 of the Charter. Decree No. 3 is, therefore, contrary to the spirit of Article 6.\n60. Article 7(1)(d) of the Charter reads: Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This\ncomprises:... the right to be tried within a reasonable period of time by an impartial court or tribunal.\n61. Given that the Minister of Interior could detain anyone without trial for up to six months, and could\nextend the period ad infinitum, his powers in this case, are analogous to that of a court, and with all intents\nand purposes, he is more likely to use his discretion at the detriment of the detainees, who are already in a\ndisadvantaged position. The victims will be at the mercy of the Minister who, in this case, will render favour\nrather than vindicating a right. This power granted to the Minister renders valueless the provision enshrined\nin Article 7(1)(d) of the Charter.\n62. Article 7(2) of the Charter reads:\nNo one may be condemned for an act or omission which did not constitute a legally punishable offence at\nthe time it was committed. No penalty may be inflicted for an offence for which no provision was made at\n5\n\n\fthe time it was committed.\n63. This provision is a general prohibition on retroactivity. It is to ensure that, citizens at all times are fully\naware of the state of the law under which they are living. The Economic Crimes (Specified Offences)\nDecree of 25th November 1994, which was deemed to have come into force in July 1994, is therefore, a\nserious violation of this right.\n64. Article 9 of the Charter reads:\n1.\n2. Every individual shall have the right to receive information.\n3. Every individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinion within the law.\n65. The government did not provide any defence to the allegations of arrests, detentions, expulsions and\nintimidation of journalists, made by the Complainant. The intimidation and arrest or detention of journalists\nfor articles published and questions asked deprives not only the journalists of their rights to freely express\nand disseminate their opinions, but also the public, of the right to information. This action is clearly a breach\nof the provisions of Article 9 of the Charter.\n66. The Complainant alleges that political parties have been banned, and that an Independent Member of\nParliament and his supporters were arrested for planning a peaceful demonstration. In addition, Ministers\nand Members of Parliament in the former regime have been banned from taking part in any political activity\nand some of them restricted from traveling out of the country; with a maximum sentence of three years for\nany default.\n67. The imposition of the ban on former Ministers and Members of Parliament is in contravention of their\nrights to participate freely in the government of their country provided for under Article 13(1) of the Charter.\nArticle 13(1) reads: Every citizen shall have the right to participate freely in the government of his country,\neither directly or through freely chosen representatives in accordance with the provisions of the law.\n68. Also, the banning of political parties is a violation of the Complainants' rights to freedom of association\nguaranteed under Article 10(1) of the Charter. In its decision on communication 101/93, the Commission\nstated a general principle on this right, to the effect that \"competent authorities should not enact provisions\nwhich limit the exercise of this freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional\nprovisions or undermine fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution and international human rights\nstandards\". And more importantly, the Commission in its Resolution on the Right to Freedom of Association\nhad also reiterated that: \"The regulation of the exercise of the right to freedom of association should be\nconsistent with States' obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights\". This principle\ndoes not apply to freedom of association alone but to all other rights and freedoms enshrined in the\nCharter, including, the right to freedom of assembly. Article 10(1) provides:\nEvery individual shall have the right to free association provided that he abides by the law.\n69. The Commission also finds the ban an encroachment on the right to freedom of assembly guaranteed\nby Article 11 of the Charter. Article 11 reads:\nEvery individual shall have the right to assemble freely with others\n70. The restrictions to travel placed on the former Ministers and Members of Parliament is also a violation\nof their right to freedom of movement and the right of ingress and egress provided for under Article 12 of\nthe Charter. Article 12 provides: (1) Every individual shall have the right to freedom of movement and\nresidence within the borders of a state provided he abides by the law. (2) Every individual shall have the\nright to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. This right may only be subject to\nrestrictions, provided for by law for the protection of national security, law and order, public health or\nmorality.\n71. Section 62 of the Gambian Constitution of 1970 provides for elections based on universal suffrage, and\nSection 85(4) made it mandatory for elections to be held within at most five years. Since independence in\n1965, The Gambia has always had a plurality of parties participating in elections. This was temporarily\nhalted in 1994 when the military seized power.\n72. The Complainant alleges that the right of Gambian people to self-determination has been violated. He\nclaims that the policy that the people freely choose to determine their political status, since independence\nhas been \"hijacked\" by the military. That the military has imposed itself on the people.\n6\n\n\f73. It is true that the military regime came to power by force, albeit, peacefully. This was not through the will\nof the people who have known only the ballot box since independence, as a means of choosing their\npolitical leaders. The military coup was therefore a grave violation of the right of Gambian people to freely\nchoose their government as entrenched in Article 20(1) of the Charter. Article 20(1) provides:\nAll peoples shall ... freely determine their political status... according to the policy they have freely chosen. 2\n74. The rights and freedoms of individuals enshrined in the Charter can only be fully realised if\ngovernments provide structures which enable them to seek redress if they are violated. By ousting the\ncompetence of the ordinary courts to handle human rights cases, and ignoring court judgements, the\nGambian military government demonstrated clearly that the courts were not independent. This is a violation\nof Article 26 of the Charter. Article 26 of the Charter reads:\nStates Parties to the Charter shall have the duty to guarantee the independence of the Courts...and shall\nallow the establishment and improvement of appropriate national institutions entrusted with the promotion\nand protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the present Charter.\n\nDecision of the African Commission\n\nFor the above reasons, the Commission\nHolds a violation of the following provisions of the Charter: Articles 1, 2, 6,7(1)(d), 7(2), 9(1), 9(2), 10(1),\n11, 12(1), 12(2), 20(1) and 26 of the Charter (for the period within which the violations occurred).\nRequests the Government of The Gambia to bring its laws in conformity with the provisions of the Charter.\n\nAlgiers, Algeria, 11th May 2000.\n\nFootnotes\n* Editor's note: Decision 60/91 has only 14 paragraphs in English and in French.

Fatsah Ouguergouz)\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE FATSAH OUGUERGOUZ\n1. I am in agreement with the views of my colleagues in regard to the conclusions reached by the Court on\nthe question of its jurisdiction and on that of the costs and expenses of the case, and consequently I have\nvoted in favour of the said conclusions. However, I believe that these two issues deserved to be developed\nin a more comprehensive manner.\n2. The Applicant indeed has the right to know why it has taken nearly one year between the date of receipt\nof his application at the Registry and the date on which the Court took its decision thereon. Senegal, on the\nother hand, has the right to know why the Court chose to make a solemn ruling on the application by\nmeans of a Judgment, rather than reject it de plano with a simple letter issued by the Registry. The two\nParties also have the right to know the reasons for which their prayers in respect of the costs and\nexpenses, respectively, of the case, have been rejected; the Applicant should also know why his prayer in\nthis regard was addressed on the basis of Rule 30 of the Interim Rules of the Court (hereinafter referred to\nas the \"Rules\") on Legal Costs, whereas the Court could have equally, if not exclusively, treated this prayer\non the basis of Rule 31 on Legal Assistance.\n3. However, only the question of the jurisdiction of the Court seems to me to be sufficiently vital, to lead me\nto append to the Judgment, an exposé of my separate opinion in regard to the manner in which this\nquestion should have been treated by the Court.\n4. In the present case, the question of the jurisdiction of the Court is relatively simple. It is that of the\nCourt's \"personal jurisdiction\" or \"jurisdiction ratione personae\" in respect of applications brought by\nindividuals. This is governed by Article 5 (3) of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples'\nRights on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (hereinafter referred to as\n\"Protocol\") and Article 31 (6) of the said Protocol which set forth the modalities by which a State shall\naccept the said jurisdiction.\n5. However, paragraph 31 of the Judgment states, not without ambiguity, that for the Court to hear a case\nbrought directly by an individual against a State Party, there must be compliance with, inter alia, Article 5(3)\nand Article 34 (6) of the Protocol.\n6. If the only issue referred to here is that of the jurisdiction of the Court, then the expression \"inter alia\"\nintroduces confusion because it lends itself to the understanding that the said jurisdiction is predicated on\none or several other conditions that have not been spelt out. However, in my view, there are no other\nconditions to the jurisdiction of the Court in the case than that which has been specified in Article 34 (6) of\nthe Protocol, reference to which was made in Article 5 (3).\n7. Nevertheless, if the expression \"inter alia\" also refers to the conditions for admissibility of the application,\nthere would no longer be any logical linkage between paragraph 31 and paragraph 29 of the Judgment in\nwhich the Court indicated that it would start by considering the question of its jurisdiction. It would be\nparticularly difficult to understand the meaning of paragraph 39 in which the Court gives its interpretation of\nthe word \"receive\" as used in Article 34 (6) of the Protocol. In paragraph 39, the Court indeed points out\nthat the word \"receive\" as applied to the application should not be understood in its literal meaning as\nreferring to \"physically receiving\" nor in its technical sense as referring to \"admissibility\"; rather it refers to\nthe \"jurisdiction\" of the Court to \"examine\" the application; that is to say, its jurisdiction to hear the case, as\nit states very clearly in paragraph 37 in fine of the Judgment.\n8. Read in light of paragraph 39 of the Judgment, paragraph 31 should therefore be interpreted as referring\nexclusively to the question of the Court's jurisdiction. Since the meaning of the expression \"inter alia\" is\nunclear, the Court had better do away with it.\n9. Even if the expression is removed therefrom, paragraph 31 of the Judgment, and also paragraph 34\nthereof, pose the question of the Court's jurisdiction in terms that do not faithfully reflect the Court's liberal\napproach to the treatment of the application.\n10. In the foregoing two paragraphs of the Judgment, the question of the Court's jurisdiction is indeed\nposed by the exclusive reference to Article 5(3) and Article 34 (6) of the Protocol. However, Article 5\nessentially deals with the question of \"Access to the Court\" as the title clearly indicates. Thus, the question\nof the personal jurisdiction of the Court in this case cannot but receive the response set forth in paragraph\n37 of the Judgment, i.e., that since Senegal has not made the declaration provided for in Article 34 (6) of\nthe Protocol, the Court has no jurisdiction to hear cases instituted directly against this State by individuals.\n1\n\n\fThis ruling could have been made expeditiously in terms of the preliminary consideration of the Court's\njurisdiction as provided for in Rule 39 of the Rules.\n11. Though of fundamental importance to the question of the personal jurisdiction of the Court, Article 5 (3)\nand Article 34 (6) of the Protocol should be read in their context, i.e. in particular in light of Article 3 of the\nProtocol entitled \"Jurisdiction\" of the Court.\n12. Indeed, although the two are closely related, the issues of the Court's \"jurisdiction\" and of \"access\" to\nthe Court are no less distinct, as paragraph 39 of the Judgment in fact suggests1 ; it is precisely this\ndistinction that explains why the Court did not reject de plano the application given the manifest lack of\njurisdiction, by means of a simple letter issued by the Registry, and why it took time to rule on the\napplication by means of a very solemn Judgment.\n13. The application was received at the Court Registry on 29 December 2008 and it was placed on the\ngeneral list as No. 001/2008. The application was served on Senegal on 5 January 2009; and on the same\nday, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission was informed about the filing of the application and\nthrough him the Executive Council and the other Parties to the Protocol.\n14. Thus, upon submission, the application was subject to a number of procedural acts including its\nregistration on the general list of the Court2 and its service on Senegal.\n15. For their part, applications or communications addressed to the African Commission on Human and\nPeoples' Rights3 , the defunct European Commission of Human Rights4 , the Inter-American Commission\nof Human Rights5 , the United Nations Human Rights Committee6 or the International Court of Justice, for\nexample7 , undergo a process of vetting prior to being registered or served on the States against which\nthey were instituted.\n16. In this case, the application did not go through this initial procedural phase of vetting. It was treated in\nthe same way as the applications brought before the International Court of Justice before 01 July 1978,\ndate of entry into force of its new Rules8 . Prior to that date, all cases brought before the Court, including\nthose instituted against States that had not previously accepted the Court's jurisdiction by making the\noptional declaration accepting the compulsory jurisdiction provided for in Article 36 (2)\n× The states parties to the present Statute may at any time declare that they recognize as compulsory ipso\nfacto and without special agreement, in relation to any other state accepting the same obligation, the\njurisdiction of the Court in all legal disputes concerning: a. the interpretation of a treaty; b. any question of\ninternational law; c. the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an\ninternational obligation; d. the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an\ninternational obligation.\n* of the Statute, were indeed placed on the general list and served on the States against which they were\ninstituted, and on the United Nations Secretary General and, through him, on all the other members of the\nOrganisation.\n17. As indicated in the foregoing paragraph 13, procedural acts similar to the aforesaid were undertaken in\nconnection with Mr. Yogogombaye's application; this was, inter alia, served on Senegal under covering\nletter dated 5 January 2009.\n18. Senegal acknowledged receipt thereof by letter dated 10 February 2009 in which it also transmitted the\nnames of those to represent it before the Court. At that stage, Senegal could have limited itself to indicating\nthat it had not made the declaration provided for in Article 34 (6) of the Protocol and that, consequently, the\nCourt had no jurisdiction to deal with the application on the grounds of the provisions of Article 5 (3) of the\nProtocol. However, by notifying the Court of the names of its representatives, it gave room for the\nsuggestion that it did not exclude appearing before the Court and of participating in its proceedings, with\ndoubts as to the object of its participation: to contest the Court's jurisdiction, contest the admissibility of the\napplication or to defend itself on the merits of the case.\n19. By a second letter dated 17 February 2009, Senegal requested the Court to extend the time limit for\nsubmission of its observations to \"enable it to better prepare a reply to the application\". By so doing,\nSenegal signaled its intention to comply with the provisions of Rule 37 of the Rules according to which \"the\nState Party against which an application has been tiled shall respond thereto within sixty (60) days provided\nthat the Court may, if the need arises, grant an extension of time\". Even in this letter. Senegal did not\nexclude the eventual acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction. Still at this stage, it could have put up the\nargument that it has not made the declaration provided for in Article 34 (6) of the Protocol and, on that\nground, contested the jurisdiction of the Court.\n20. Even though it would not have made the aforementioned declaration, Senegal, by its attitude, left open\nthe possibility, however slim, that it might accept the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with the application.\n2\n\n\f21. The fundamental principle regarding the acceptance of the jurisdiction of an international Court is\nindeed that of consent, a principle which itself is derived from that of the sovereignty of the State. A State's\nconsent is the condition sine qua non for the jurisdiction of any international Court9 , irrespective of the\nmoment or the way the consent is expressed10 .\n22. This principle of jurisdiction by consent is also upheld by the Protocol. Thus, in contentious matters, the\nCourt can exercise jurisdiction only in respect of the States Parties to the Protocol. The scope of the Court's\njurisdiction in such cases and the modalities of access thereto are defined in Articles 3 and 5, respectively,\nof the Protocol.\n23. By becoming Parties to the Protocol, member States of the African Union ipso facto accept the\njurisdiction of the Court to entertain applications from other States Parties, the African Commission or\nAfrican Inter-governmental Organisations. The jurisdiction of the Court in respect of applications from\nindividuals or Non-Governmental Organisations against States Parties is not, for its part, automatic; it\ndepends on the optional expression of consent by the States concerned.\n24. This is provided for in Article 34(6) of the Protocol which states that: \"At the time of ratification of this\nProtocol or any time thereafter, the State shall make a declaration accepting the competence of the Court\nto receive cases under Article 5 (3) of this Protocol. The Court shall not receive any petition under Article 5\n(3) involving a State Party which has not made such a declaration\". As it is drafted, this provision raises two\nquestions:\n25. The first is the meaning to give to the word \"shall\" used in the first sentence which suggests that filing of\nthe declaration by the State Party is an \"obligation\" for the State Party and not simply \"a matter of choice\".\n26. Understood in this way, Article 34 (6) would make it obligatory for State Parties to make such a\ndeclaration after depositing their instruments of ratification (or accession)11 . This prescription does not\nhowever have any real legal effect because it does not set any time limit. It also does not make much\nsense when read in light of its context and particularly of Article 5 (3) and the second sentence of 34 (6)\nwhich states that \"The Court shall not receive any petition under Article 5 (3) involving a State Party which\nhas not made such a declaration\". It can thus be said in conclusion that the filing of the declaration is\noptional: this conclusion is corroborated by an analysis of the \"travaux préparatoires\" of the Protoco1.12\n27. The second question raised in Article 34 (6) is that of whether the filing of the optional declaration by\nStates Parties is the only means of expressing their recognition of the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with\napplications brought against them by individuals.\n28. In this regard, it should first be noted that Article 34 (6) does not require that the filing of the optional\ndeclaration be done \"before\" the filing of the application; it simply provides that the declaration may be\nmade \"at the time of ratification or any time thereafter\". Nothing therefore prevents a State Party from\nmaking the declaration \"after\" an application has been introduced against it. In accordance with Article 34\n(4) of the Protocol, the declaration, just as ratification or accession, enters into force from the time of\nsubmission and takes effect from this date. Senegal was therefore free to make such a declaration after the\napplication was introduced.\n29. If a State can accept the jurisdiction of the Court by filing an optional declaration \"at any time\", nothing\nin the Protocol prevents it from granting its consent, after the introduction of the application, in a manner\nother than through the optional declaration.13\n30. Therefore, the second sentence of Article 34 (6) must not, as the first sentence, be interpreted literally.\nIt must be read in light of the object and purpose of the Protocol and, in particular, in light of Article 3\nentitled \"Jurisdiction\" of the Court. Indeed, Article 3 provides in general manner that: \"the jurisdiction of the\nCourt shall extend to all cases and disputes submitted to it\"; it also provides that \"in the event of dispute as\nto whether the Court has jurisdiction, the Court shall decide\". It therefore lies with the Court to determine in\nall sovereignty the conditions for the validity of its seizure; and do so only in the light of the principle of\nconsent.\n31. Consent by a State Party is the only condition for the Court to exercise jurisdiction with regard to\napplications brought by individuals. This consent may be expressed before the filing of an application\nagainst the State Party, with the submission of the declaration mentioned in Article 34 (6) of the Protocol. It\nmay also be expressed later, either formally through the filing of such a declaration, or informally or\nimplicitly through forum prorogutum.14\n32. Forum prorogatum or \"prorogation of competence\" may be understood as the acceptance of the\njurisdiction of an international Court by a State after the seizure of this Court by another State or an\nindividual, and this either, expressly or tacitly, through decisive acts or an unequivocal behaviour.15 It was\nin particular this possibility that the letters issued by Senegal dated 10 and 17 of February 2009 led the\n3\n\n\fCourt to foresee in this case.\n33. Up to 9 April 2009, the date on which the Registry received the written observations of Senegal, there\nwas the possibility that Senegal might accept the jurisdiction of the Court. It was only on this date that it\nbecame unequivocally clear that Senegal had no intention of accepting the Court's jurisdiction to deal with\nthe application.\n34. It was therefore up to the Court to take into account Senegal's refusal to consent to the jurisdiction of\nthe Court to deal with the application and to draw the consequences thereof by putting an end to the matter\nand removing the case from the general list.\n35. Under the former Rules of the International Court of Justice (before 01 July 1978), when a case was\nbrought against a State which has not previously accepted the jurisdiction of the Court by filing the optional\ndeclaration and such a State did not accept the Court's jurisdiction in regard to the case after having been\ninvited to do so by the Applicant State, such a case was closed by the issuance of a succinct order.16 In the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights where the problem of jurisdiction occurs less frequently than that of\nadmissibility of applications, when there is no serious doubt as to the inadmissibility of an application, the\ncorresponding decision is notified to the applicant through a simple letter.17\n36. In the present case, Senegal having formally raised preliminary objections in its \"statement of\ndefense\"18 dated 9 April 2009, the Court deemed it necessary to comply with the provisions of Rule 52 (7)\nof its Rules which stipulates that \"The Court shall give reasons for its ruling on the preliminary objection\"19 .\n[Ed. Note: The expression \"arr?t motive\" in French appears as \"ruling\" in the English version of Rule 52 (7)\nof the Rules].\n37. However, consideration by the Court of Senegal's preliminary objections, in a judgment, required that it\naddresses the question of it's [sic] jurisdiction in a more comprehensive manner by developing in particular\nthe possibility of a forum prorogatum. This possibility is all the more suggested in paragraph 37 of the\nJudgment where the Court, on the grounds of its ruling that Senegal has not made the optional declaration,\nconcluded that the said State, on that basis, \"has not accepted the jurisdiction of the Court to hear cases\ninstituted directly against the Country by individuals or non governmental organizations\". [Ed. Note: The\nexpression \"sur cette base\" in French does not appear in the English version of paragraph 37 of the\nJudgment.]\n38. Nevertheless, it is this possibility of a forum prorogatum, however slight, that explains why the\napplication of Mr. Yogogombaye was not rejected right after 10 February 2009; and it is the filing of\npreliminary objections by Senegal which explains why the Court did not close the case in a less solemn\nmanner by issuing an order or by simple letter by the Registry.\n39. The submission of preliminary objections by Senegal may, in turn, be explained by scrupulous\ncompliance by this State with the provisions of Rule 37 and 52 (1) of the Rules.\n40. Today, the question is whether \"all\" applications filed with the Registry should be placed on the Court's\ngeneral list, notified to the States against which they are directed, and above all, as provided for under\nArticle 35 (3) of the Rules, notified to the Chairperson of the African Union Commission and, through him,\nto the Executive Council of the Union, as well as to all the other States Parties to the Protocol. As a judicial\norgan, once the Court receives an application, it has the obligation to ensure, at least in a prima facie\nmanner, that it has jurisdiction in the matter20 . Certainly, here lies the object of preliminary consideration by\nthe Court of its jurisdiction as provided for in Rule 39 of its Rules. A selection should then be made between\nindividual applications in respect of which, at a glance, the Court has jurisdiction and those in respect of\nwhich it has not, which is the case when the State party concerned has not made the optional declaration.\nIn this latter hypothesis, the application should be rejected de plano by simple letter by the Registry. It could\neventually be communicated to the State Party concerned, but it is only if such a State accepts the\njurisdiction of the Court that the application could be placed on the Court's general list21 and notified to the\nother States Parties. The idea is to avoid giving untimely or undue publicity to individual applications in\nrespect of which the Court clearly lacks jurisdiction.\n41. In this regard, it is important to point out that the potential authors of individual applications may in the\npresent circumstances experience difficulties knowing the situation of an African State vis-?-vis the optional\ndeclaration. Indeed, only the list of the States Parties to the Protocol is being published on the African\nUnion Commission website and this list does not mention the States that have made the optional\ndeclaration. It would therefore be desirable that the list of the States that have made the said declaration be\nsimilarly published on the website for the purposes of bringing the information to the knowledge of\nindividuals and non governmental organisations.\n\n4\n\n\f42. The Court, for its part, cannot be satisfied with such publication as it does not have official value, and is\nnot a \"real time\" reflection of the status of participation in the Protocol and in the system of the optional\ndeclaration. To date, the list of States Parties to the Protocol and that of the States Parties that have made\nthe optional declaration, while being of primary interest to the Court, are not automatically notified to the\nCourt by the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, depository of the Protocol. The Protocol does\nnot oblige the depository to communicate declarations to the Court Registry, its Article 34 (7) contenting\nitself with providing that declarations should be deposited with the Chairperson of the African Union\nCommission \"who shall transmit copies thereof to the State parties\". The Statute of the International Court\nofJustice22 and the American Convention of [sic] Human Rights23 , for their part, provide that the\ndepositories of the optional declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of\nJustice and the Inter-American Court, respectively, should file copies thereof in the Registries of the said\ncourts. Although the relevant department of the African Union Commission is not legally bound to do so, it\nwould also be desirable that in future the said department inform the Court of any update of the two\nabove-mentioned lists.\nFatsah Ouguergouz\nAboubakar Diakité Registrar\n\nFootnotes\n* Editor's note: Link accessed on 30/03/2012 at 4.00pm\n1 On this point, see for example, Prosper Weil who notes as follows: \"jurisdiction and seizure are not only\ndistinct, conceptually; they are separate in time, normally, jurisdiction preceeds seizure [...].

In the Inter-American Court,\nindividuals having no direct access to the Court, the question of personal jurisdiction indeed arises only in\nregard to State Parties; in the European Court where individuals have direct access to the Court, it has\nautomatic jurisdiction solely on the ground of the participation of the member States of the Council of\nEurope in the European Convention on Human Rights.\n8 Rule 38, paragraph 5, of the current Rules of Procedure of the International Court of Justice states that:\n\"When the Applicant State proposes to found the jurisdiction of the Court upon a consent thereto yet to be\ngiven or manifested by the State against which such application is made, the application shall be\ntransmitted to that State. It shall not however be entered in the General List, nor any action be taken in the\nproceedings, unless and until the State against which such application is made consents to the Court's\njurisdiction for the purposes of the case\" (emphasis added).\n9 \"It is a well established principle in International Law that no State can be compelled to submit its disputes\nwith other States to mediation, arbitration or to any method of peaceful solution without its consent\",\nPermanent Court of International Justice, Statute of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion of 23 July 1923,\nSeries B, p.27.\n10 \"Such consent may be given once and for all in the form of a freely accepted obligation: it may however\nbe given in a specific case beyond any pre-existing obligation\". id\n6\n\n\f11 Paragraph 6 of the English version, unlike the French, provides that the declaration may be freely made\non two different occasions: \"at the time of the ratification of this Protocol or any time thereafter\" (emphasis\nadded); the Arab and Portuguese versions of the said Paragraph 6 are identical to the English version.\n12 See Article 6 (1) (Special jurisdiction) of the Cape Town draft (September 1995), Draft Protocol to the\nAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the establishment of an African Court on Human and\nPeoples' Rights, Government Legal Experts Meeting on the establishment of an African Court on Human\nand Peoples' Rights, 6-12 September 1995, Cape Town, South Africa, Doc.

On 27 July 2012 the Secretariat of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the\nChild (henceforth, the Committee ) received a communication, pursuant to Article 44(1) of the African\nCharter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (herein after, the Charter ), submitted by the Centre for\nHuman Rights, University of Pretoria (South Africa) and La Rencontre Africaine pour la Défense des Droits\nde lHomme (RADDHO) of Senegal (all of which shall be referred later as the Complainants ).\n2. The Complainants are alleging that children as many as 100,000 (known as talibés ), aged between 4\nand 12 years, are sent away by their parents to live in Quranic schools known as daaras in the urban\ncentres of the Republic of Senegal (henceforth, referred to as the Respondent State ) allegedly to receive\nreligious education. The Complainants allege that the situation depicts the difficulties that such children are\nfacing in attaining government schooling.\n3. The Complainants, moreover, allege that the talibés are forced by their instructors 1 known as marabouts\n) to work on the streets as beggars. According to the Complainants, such forced child begging has been an\non-going practice in the Respondent State since the 1980s, despite the existence of provisions in the Penal\nCode 2 outlawing the practice of forcing a child to beg. 3 These penal provisions have been reinforced by\nthe Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Related Practices 4 and to Protect Victims adopted by the\nRespondent State in 2005, which prescribes 5-10 years imprisonment and a fine of five to twenty million\nCFA francs for a person found guilty of forcing a child to beg.\n4. According to the Complaints, despite the existence of these legislations, the Respondent State has made\nlittle efforts to enforce these provisions with a view to penalizing the marabouts who force talibés to beg,\nconsequent to which as of 2011 only 10 cases were brought to court resulting in nine convictions of\nmarabouts. The Complaints submit that the highest actual duration of imprisonment for all convictions\nunder the foregoing laws was one month imprisonment; which, according to them, represents a decrease in\nthe severity of penalties imposed on the marabouts as compared to past years.\n5. The Complainants also allege that the Respondent State's Constitution (2001) 5 allows only specific\nindividuals under specific mandates to bring cases and only to challenge the constitutionality of certain\nprovisions of any law. And, as such, there is no actio popularis in the Respondent State's legal system.\nCases for vindication of human rights violations may only be brought to court by individuals who have been\ndirectly affected by a violation and any decision will provide remedy only for those litigants, or for those who\nare directly connected to the case or have un interest et qualite pour agir .\n6. According to the Complainants, where a non-state agency wants to represent victims of violations of\nhuman rights, like the talibés in this matter, the consent of parents must first be obtained. The only other\navenue to bring such a claim to court is to petition the Chief Prosecutor, whose decision is made\ndiscretionary and in consultation with the Minister responsible for justice.\n7. In addition, the Complainants allege that the Respondent State has not provided minimum standards to\n1\n\n\fregulate non-state schools and that it does not conduct inspections of the daaras to check if there are\nviolations of the rights of the talibés attending schooling and living therein.\n8. The Complainant allege further that the conditions in many daaras are deplorable; usually housed in\nunsafe and unhygienic structures where children sleep in over-crowded rooms or outside, with little or no\naccess to clean water or sanitation. Talibés living in daaras rarely obtain enough food resulting in chronic\nmalnourishment and frequently contract diseases where the marabouts do not provide the talibés with\nmedical care or assistance. In some instances, according to the Complainants, the talibés are injured by\nspeeding motor vehicles in the course of begging on the streets\n9. The Complainants also allege that the talibés are required to bring a daily quota (in the form of rice,\nsugar or money) that they collected from begging in the streets to the daaras , failure to attain which results\nin beatings and punishments to defaulting talibés . On average, talibés spend between six and eight hours\nbegging, which leaves them with less than five hours to spend on Qur'anic education per day. As result of\ntheir concentration on attaining their daily quotas, many talibés do not learn the Qur'an as it is\ncontemplated.\n10. Furthermore, the Complainants allege that the talibés are normally separated from living with their\nparents and are deprived of any contact with their families. The talibés are also physically assaulted and\nharshly punished when they attempt to leave the daaras .\n\nThe Complaints\nAdmissibility\nComplainants' submission on admissibility\n\n11. The Complainants allege that, as a result of the foregoing situation and due to the failure by the\nRespondent State to protect the talibés , there are continuous violations of numerous rights and freedoms\nof such children, to which they are entitled under the Charter. It is the Complainants' allegation that the\nRespondent State has violated, and continues to violate, the provisions of Article 4 (best interests of the\nchild); Article 5 (the right to survival and development); Article 11 (the right to education); Article 12 (the\nright to leisure, recreation and cultural activities); Article 14 (the right to health and health services); Article\n15 (prohibition of child labour); Article 16 (protection against child abuse and torture); Article 21 (protection\nagainst harmful social and cultural practices); and Article 29 (prohibition of sale, trafficking and abduction of\nchildren) of the Charter.\n12. The Complainants have indicated that they have submitted the present Communication on behalf of the\ntalibes in the Respondent State, whose rights under the Charter have been violated by the Respondent\nState. And, as such, they have the competence to do so under Chapter 2 Article 1(I)(2)\n× The Author of the communication shall specify either to have been a victim of violations of the rights spelt\nout in the Charter, or to act on behalf of a victim or of other eligible parties.\nof the Committee's Communication Guidelines. The Complainants are of the view that they can submit the\nCommunication even if the consent of the victims was not obtained since they are acting in the overall best\ninterest of the child . The Complainants further argue that the consent of the victims is not a requirement\nwhen there is evidence of serious, massive and systematic violations of the rights of talibes as it was\nindicated in Commission's decision in Amnesty International v Sudan6 .\n13. Concerning the form of the Communication, the Complainant submit that the present communication\nsatisfies the requirement as to form as set out in Chapter 2 Article 1(II)(1)\n× No communication shall be considered by the Committee if:\n• it is anonymous;\n2\n\n\f• it is not written;\n• it concerns a State non-signatory to the Charter.\nof the Communication Guidelines, which requires that a communication should not be anonymous; should\nbe written; and should concern a State signatory to the Charter.\n14. In relation to the content of the Communication, the Complainants submit that the communication has\nsatisfied the requirements as to content as per Chapter 2 Article 1 (III) (1) (a) (b) &(c) of the Communication\nGuidelines since the communication concerns violations of the provisions of the African Children's Charter;\nit is not solely based on information circulated by the media; it has not been considered according to\nanother investigation, procedure or international regulation.\n15. The Complainants submit that exhaustion of local remedy in this matter is unnecessary considering the\nbest interests of the number of children whose rights are being violated relying on a decision of the African\nCommission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR/the Commission) in African Institute for Human\nRights and Development (sic!) v Guinea . 7 . In the cited Decision, the Commission held that a local remedy\ncould not be exhausted given the number of potential victims who were in the region since it would be\nimpractical for them to approach the courts. The Complainants are of the view that international law\nrequires that the exhaustion of domestic remedies should only be in respect of those that are available,\neffective and adequate. And the Complainants argue that there is no effective judicial remedy for the talibes\ninsofar as actio popularis in the Respondent State's courts is not in favour of the talibes as they do not have\nstanding to do so. In addition, the Complainants have invoked the jurisprudence of the Commission which\nreveals that in cases of serious and massive violations , local remedies need not be exhausted. 8 In this\ncase, it is the Complainants' submission that the failure by the Respondent State to protect so many\nchildren on the streets in the State's major cities where they suffer egregious violations of their rights\nenshrined in the Charter for so many years amount to serious and massive violations.\nACERWC's analysis and decision on admissibility\n\n16. The Committee notes that the Complainants are non-governmental organizations recognized by the\nAfrican Union through the Commission; and are doing so on behalf of victim talibes in the Respondent\nState and therefore can be the authors of the Communication.\n17. The Committee also notes that the Complainants have satisfied the conditions and requirement as to\nform as laid down in Chapter 2 Article 1(I)\n× No communication shall be considered by the Committee if:\n• it is anonymous;\n• it is not written;\n• it concerns a State non-signatory to the Charter.\nof the Committee's Communication Guidelines, i.e. the communication explicitly states the name of the\nauthors, is well written and concerns a State Party to the Charter.\n18. In the matter of content of the Communication, the Committee agrees that the communication is\ncompatible with the Constitutive Act of the AU and the Charter as it concerns violations of the provisions of\nthe Charter. The Committee notes the Commission's Decision in Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum v\nZimbabwe9 to the effect that to be compatible with the Charter, the communication has only got to invoke\nprovisions of the law which are presumed to have been violated. 10 The Committee in this matter also\nagrees with the Complainant that the Communication is not solely based on information circulated by\nmedia; rather it is based on information provided, inter alia, by the alleged victims primarily through\npersonal interviews of the talibes made by the complaining NGOs and information obtained from reports\nmade by credible organisations. In addition, the Committee has undertaken investigation and confirmed\n3\n\n\fthat the issue at hand has not been considered in another international procedure.\n19. In considering whether or not the Complainants have exhausted local remedies available in the\nRespondent State, the Committee would like to reiterate its position that is stated in Children of Nubian\nDescents Case . 11 In that communication, the Committee held that Article 46 of the Charter mandates it to\ndraw inspiration from International Law on Human Rights. Basing this explicit legislative mandate, the\nCommittee made reference to laws, and jurisprudence from other countries or treaty bodies in Africa and\nelsewhere. 12\n20. The Committee would also like to draw inspiration from the ACHPR in considering the requirement to\nexhaust local remedy. In Sir Dawda Jawara v The Gambia13 , the Commission held that a remedy is\nconsidered available if the complainant can pursue it without impediment 14 ; it is deemed effective if it\noffers a prospect of success; and it is found sufficient if it is capable of redressing the complaint. 15\nTherefore, it is a well-established jurisprudence of the Commission that only domestic remedies that are\navailable, effective, and adequate (sufficient) that need to be exhausted . 16 As such, the Commission has\nrecognized that the exhaustion of prior domestic remedies implies and assumes the availability,\neffectiveness and sufficiency of domestic adjudication procedures. If local remedies are unduly prolonged,\nunavailable, ineffective or insufficient, the exhaustion rule will not bar consideration of the case by the\nCommission. 17\n21. From this analysis of the jurisprudence of the Commission, the following exceptions to the rule of prior\nexhaustion of local remedy are remarkable. First, domestic remedies must be of judicial nature ; second,\ndomestic remedies must not be unduly prolonged ; third, where there are ouster clauses domestic\nremedies are rendered unavailable; and, fourth, local remedies cannot be exhausted where there are a\nlarge number of potential victims of violations of human rights.\n22. The Complainants have amply demonstrated that the Respondent State's penal laws (Penal Code) 18\nand Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Related Practices and to Protect Victims adopted by the\nRespondent State in 2005 19 proscribe forcing a child to beg. 20 However, the Respondent State has made\nlittle efforts to enforce these provisions with a view to penalizing the marabouts who force talibes to beg. It\nis in record that, as of 2011 only 10 cases were brought to court resulting in nine convictions on marabouts\n. The Complaints have submitted that the highest actual duration of imprisonment for all conventions under\nthe foregoing laws was one month imprisonment and the Committee is of the view that this avenue\ninefficient.\n23. The Committee also finds the avenue to petition the Chief Prosecutor to bring a claim to court on behalf\nof the talibes victims of violations of their rights by marabouts in the daaras to be ineffective because the\nChief Prosecutor's decision is made discretionary and in consultation with the Minister responsible for\njustice, which does not amount to a remedy that is judicial in nature. Another avenue that the Complainants\nalso have indicated to be in place in the Respondent State is the requirement that only the victim talibes or\nsomeone directly affected by the alleged violations can bring cases in domestic courts. In practice, this\nwould entail each of the estimated 100,000 talibes would bring their own claim in courts. The Committee\nconcurs with Complainants' submission that this avenue is so impractical as to be virtually impossible .\nTherefore, the Committee is of the view that the Complainants should avail from the exceptions of the\nrequirement of exhaustion of local remedies as there is no effective and sufficient remedy for the talibes .\n24. In view of the forgoing reasons, during its 21 st Ordinary Session, which was held 15 to 19 April 2013,\nthe Committee found the Communication to have fulfilled all the admissibility conditions as laid down in the\nCommittee's Guidelines on the Consideration of Communications and as such, the Committee declared the\nComplaint admissible.\nProcedure\n\n25. After the decision on admissibility, the Committee transmitted the complaint to the Respondent State,\n4\n\n\fwhich duly filed its written reply, after which the matter was scheduled for a public hearing. During its 23 rd\nOrdinary Session, from 9 - 16 April 2014 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, a public hearing was held where\nrepresentatives of the Complainants and the Respondent State made their oral submissions.\nThe Respondent State's Arguments\n\n26. Both in its written reply to the Complaints and oral submissions, the Respondent State has not\nspecifically rejected the allegations. It has actually admitted that the alleged violations of the various\nCharter provisions exist, and continue to take place.\n27. In recognition of the existence of the alleged violations, the Respondent State submitted that it has\nadopted various constitutional, policy, legislative and administrative measures aimed at, inter alia ,\nprotecting all children, particularly those forced to beg. In particular, the Respondent State contended that\nas a result of a workshop that was held early 2013 to formulate strategic plans of action for the eradication\nof child begging, an inter-ministerial council on the managing of child begging was convened on Friday, 8\nFebruary 2013, under the auspices of the Honourable Prime Minister. Consequent to this event, an ad-hoc\nCommittee was set up and it has adopted a number of recommendations which revolve around three\nstrategic options:\n\n1. The withdrawal of all child beggars from the street and their temporary placement in public\ninstitutions, community centres and voluntary families, as well their integration with their family or\ncountry of origin. This would also involve the implementation of measures relative to the educational\naspects and to economic support for the family;\n2. Social Policy Communication for a positive and lasting behavioural change that occurs through\neffective application of the law and with the strong will of political, religious, social, and cultural\nactors aimed at eradicating child begging; and\n3. The prevention aspect; that is, while particularly emphasising policy and law enforcement, there is a\nneed for utilising existing initiatives by the communities to assist children in their villages of origin\nand the strengthening of public and community social services.\n\n28. In respect of eliminating worst forms of child labour, the Respondent State submitted that it has\nundertaken various measures; including establishing the Project for the Fight against the Worst Forms of\nChild Labour within the Ministry of Labour. Regarding the improvement of the quality of education in the\ndaaras , the Respondent State contended that it has set up the Trilingual Project of the Direction of\nAlphabetisation and of National Languages within the Ministry of National Education (i.e. Le Projet\nTrilinguisme de la Direction de l'Alphabétisation et des Langues Nationales ). This project strives to\nintervene in the daaras in order to offer the opportunity to the talibés of learning and mastering three (3)\nlanguages (i.e. French, Arabic and a national language translated in Arabic characters), in addition to\nvocational skills training.\n29. With reference to the protection of talibés and other children on the street from physical abuses, the\nRespondent State submitted that its Ministry of Interior has a specialised police force, the Minors Brigade ,\nwhose mission is to protect morally threatened children, to identify them and to ensure their reintegration, in\ncollaboration with the other structures. In addition, the Ministry of Health is developing numerous initiatives\nfor the development of the welfare of children, including l'Ecole Nationale des Travailleurs Sociaux\nSpécialisés (ENTSS), which has, since 2005, introduced a training module on the rights of the child. There\nis also the Support Cell to the Protection of the Child, which is located at the Presidency to support different\ninitiatives from state and civil society structures.\n30. The Respondent State also submitted that it has been striving to involve non-state actors, particularly\nlocal and international NGOs (including Community-based organisations) to provide assistance, advocacy\n5\n\n\fand prevention interventions. Moreover, communities and families play a primary role in the protection of\nchildren, in order to develop a common understanding of the existing structures, to create a public\nconsensus and to guide the taking of decisions at the national level.\n31. Furthermore, the Respondent State pointed out that it has ratified various international human rights\ntreaties, particularly the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and ILO Conventions on the\nElimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour and the Minimum Age Convention, namely the Conventions\n138\n× [ http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C138\nand 182\n× http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C182\n. These international treaties have been domesticated in the State Party's legislation in the context of the\n2001 Constitution, particularly through the enactment of the Code of Criminal Procedures, which\nentrenches the best interests of the child. Other pieces of legislations include the Penal Code 21 ; the\n79-1165 Decree of 20 December 1975, which prohibit punishment and physical abuse in schools and\neducation centres which are not conventional; the 2004-38 law of 28 December 2004, which has abolished\ndeath penalty and applies to all children without exception, even to foreign and migrant children; and the\n2005-06 law of 10 May 2005, which criminalizes trafficking in persons, including children, and similar\npractices, as well as prohibiting forced begging.\n32. The Respondent concluded its submission by indicating that the eradication of child begging has\nalways been a source of constant problem for the Senegalese authorities, despite the enactment of several\nprovisions of the law, decrees, policies, and various administrative measures.\nConsideration on Merits\nA. Alleged Violation of Article 4 (best interest of the child)\n\n33. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has violated Article 4 of the African Children's\nCharter, which provides for the best interest of the child, as the State has failed to protect talibés from\nviolations in the daaras . They also allege that the Respondent State is duty bound to assert the best\ninterest of children by regulating the conduct of non-state actors and ensuring that they do not violate\nchildren's rights.\n34. The Committee notes that Article 4 of the African Children Charter requires the best interest of the child,\none of the four general principles, to be the primary consideration in all actions to be taken by any person\nor authority. The principle of the best interest of the child aims at safeguarding the realization of children's\nrights effectively and contributing to their holistic development. 22\n35. In guaranteeing the best interest of the child, a State Party has the obligation to ensure the\nconsideration of the best interest of the child in all actions taken by any person or authority affecting the life\nof the child. In this context, any person is broadly interpreted and entails that entails that the principle of the\nbest interest of the child must be applied in all actions concerning children, regardless whether those\nactions are undertaken by private or public entities. The Committee also notes that action includes\nomissions and commissions that are manifested in decisions, proposals, services, procedures and other\nmeasures. 23\n36. Applying the principle of the best interest of the child to the vase at hand, the Committee notes that\napart from the interest of parents to send their children to receive religious education, Talibés children in\nthe Respondent State go to the daaras mainly because of the difficulties of attaining government schooling\nin their precincts. In the daaras , the children are forced to beg by their teachers ( marabouts ), where on\naverage, they spend six to eight hours begging with five hours or less left to spend on Qur'anic studies per\nday.\n6\n\n\f37. The Respondent State, being a State Party to the Charter, accepts the explicit prohibition of child\nbegging under Article 29(b) and it has complied with this obligation through its prohibition of child begging\nas provided for under Article 245 to 247(b) of its Penal Code. However, the Respondent State has failed to\ndischarge its obligation to enforce these provisions by not taking the necessary administrative measures,\nincluding supervision of the daaras and bringing to justice the marabouts who force talibés into begging.\nThe State Party has the obligation to protect the rights enshrined in the Charter, which requires measures\nby the State to ensure that third parties (individuals, institutions, etc.) do not deprive of children's rights. In\nthis regard the Committee refers to the jurisprudence as established by the African commission on Humans\nand Peoples' Rights. In Mouvement Burkinabe des Droits de l'Homme et des Peuples v Burkina Faso , the\nAfrican Commission on Human and Peoples Rights (henceforth, the Commission ) has set the\njurisprudence to the effect that a State Party is responsible for violation of human rights committed by\nnon-state actors as its obligation to ensure the respect for human rights demands it to take all the\nnecessary measures to ensure that non-state actors also respect the rights of children. 24 The Commission\nhas also stipulated that failure to prevent violation against children's rights by non-state actors makes the\nState internationally responsible. 25 An obligation of this type is called an obligation to protect the human\nrights standard, or, in short, the obligation to protect . Building on the Commission's jurisprudence, the\nCommittee states that the individual responsibility of non-State actors to respect the rights of children does\nnot relieve the concerned State of its obligations under human rights law to respect, protect and fulfill\nhuman rights.\n38. In the case at hand, despite the obligation set under the principle of the best Interests of the child, the\nCommittee notes that the Government of Senegal has failed to enforce current national, regional, and\ninternational laws and agreements already in place by taking measures, including prosecuting, against\nperpetrators and abusive religious leaders; and hence the Respondent State has failed its responsibility to\nprotect.\n39. Therefore, the Respondent State is responsible under Article 4 of the Charter for not taking necessary\nadministrative and other measures against the daaras , marabouts as well as parents who send their\nchildren to the daaras .\nB. Alleged violation of Article 5 (survival and development)\n\n40. The Complainants in this communication allege that the Respondent State has violated the right to\nsurvival and development of the talibés as enshrined in the Charter by not taking any action against the\nforced begging. The Complainants further state that the forced begging of the talibés causes the disregard\nof their rights to health care, education, clean and safe environment, and clean water, which in effect are\nfundamental components of the right to survival and development. Furthermore, the fixed quota imposed\non talibés for begging subjects them to an extensive, institutionalized child labour.\n41. Considering the allegation made by the Complainants, the Committee carefully analysed the situation of\nthe children in light of the elements of the right to survival and development. Article 5(1) of the African\nChildren's Charter provides that every child has an inherent right to life and this right must be protected by\nlaw. Article 5(2) complements the recognition of this right by obliging states to ensure to the maximum\nextent possible the survival, protection and development of the child. The Committee notes the\ncomplementary nature of the right to survival and development as essential preconditions to the enjoyment\nof the rights protected in the African Children's Charter. In other words, the Committee supports the\nconceptualization of the right to life survival and development as a general principle that serves to reinforce\nthe raison d'?tre of each of the rights enshrined in the Charter. 26\n42. Survival and development encapsulates the right to life and imposes an obligation on states to ensure\nan adequate standard of living for children including the right to life and their physical, mental, spiritual,\nmoral, psychological and social development. The obligations of the State Party under this principle also\nencompass protection of children's rights to access healthcare and education services, access to clean\n7\n\n\fwater, the right to live in safe and clean environment, and protection from any form of abuse and degrading\ntreatment, including child labour.\n43. In the case at hand, the Committee notes that most talibés are suffering from extreme hunger on a daily\nbasis, often eating at best one or two small meals a day, usually consisting of bread and rice. Reports and\nstudies reveal that the majority of begging children in Dakar, including talibés , were observed to be\nmalnourished, often severely. The Committee also note that deprived of food by their guardians, many\ntalibés are forced to beg in markets or door-to-door in neighborhoods to try to fulfill their daily nutritional\nneeds. As a result of the long hours talibés spend on the street, the malnutrition they suffer from\ninadequate food, and the deplorable conditions in many daaras, resulted in suffering of the children from\nfrequent illnesses.\n44. The Committee also notes that there is a reported case where nine Talibés in the dense Medina\nneighborhood died after a daara burned down on 03 March 2013. Cases of talibés being crushed in traffic\nwhile begging are also frequently reported.\n45. Despite the gravity of the problem, the Respondent State has not taken adequate measures to curb the\nsituation. The Committee strongly believe that in the face of this tragedy, the Senegalese Government must\nfinally tackle the country's widespread abuse and exploitation of young boys through forced begging. Tens\nof thousands of boys continue to live and beg in extremely precarious conditions, enriching teachers who\nhave twisted the country's tradition of religious education. The Committee, therefore, found the situation\nunacceptable and it contradicts the principles enshrined in the African Children's Charter and other\ninternational child rights instruments. Hence, the Government of Senegal has failed to ensure to the\nmaximum extent possible, the survival, protection, and development of the talibés children, As such, the\nRespondent State is in violation of Article 5 of the African Children's Charter.\nC. Alleged violation of Article 11 (education)\n\n46. Article 11 of the Charter posits that States Parties have the obligation to provide free and compulsory\nbasic education without any discrimination. 27 In realizing the right to education, the State must ensure,\ninter alia , the availability, accessibility and acceptability of the education provided to children. Availability is\nassessed in terms of quality; accessibility is determined in terms of equal opportunity, economic and\nphysical accessibility and acceptability is inferred from the quality of education provided. 28 A State Party is\nnot only obliged to provide education but also to ensure that the education so provided is of acceptable\nquality. In the context of Article 11(2)(a) of the Charter, education should be directed towards the\ndevelopment of child's personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential. The\nCommittee has noted the importance of education in relation to the responsibility of the child in its decision\nof the Children of Nubian Descents Case . 29 Children have responsibility to their family, society and\ncountry under Article 31 of the Charter; and, as such, they can discharge these obligations only when they\nget the necessary education. Furthermore, education is a tool to enhance the protection of children from\ndangerous and hazardous labour. 30 As the Commission has accentuated that the failure to provide access\nto institutions of learning would amount to a violation of the right to education under the African Charter on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights. 31\n47. The responsibility of a State in realizing the right to education includes the obligation to protect, fulfill,\nrespect and promote. The protection mandate entails a responsibility up on the State to protect children's\nright to education from being violated by third parties. To this end the State Party should set minimum\nstandards for all educational institutions 32 including the daaras . Article 11(5) of the Charter moreover\nstates that: States Parties to the present Charter shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that a child\nwho is subjected to schools or parental discipline shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the\ninherent dignity of the child and in conformity with the present Charter.\n48. The Respondent State, however, has failed to provide free and compulsory education to all children in\naccordance with the Charter. Consequently, the talibés are forced to attend in the daaras where they are\n8\n\n\fnot subjected to school fees except for the daily quota they should bring by begging. Nevertheless, the\nchildren do not get the necessary education they are entitled to in the daaras. The talibés do not get\neducation in daaras as they spend more time in begging to fulfill their daily quota. In addition, the\ngovernment failed to provide the necessary curriculum and facilities in which the daaras function in\ndelivering education.\n49. The Committee refers to the General Comment of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on the\naims of education, which states that education should be designed to empower the child by developing his\nor her skills, learning and other capacities, human dignity, self-esteem and self-confidence. 33 Moreover,\nthe Committee also refers to Article 9(b) of the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam which states\nthat every human being has a right to receive both religious and worldly education . Therefore, the\nCommittee holds a view that while many marabouts in Senegal continue the traditional practice of teaching\ntheir students the Quran, others have twisted the practice into a form of economic exploitation, as a result a\nsignificant number of talibés in Senegal are failing to receive either a religious education or an education in\nother basic skills. It is in consideration of this fact that the International Labour Organization (ILO)'s\nCommittee of Experts criticized Senegal on March 2, 2012, for its failure to protect talibés from abusive\nconditions and demanded that Senegal do more to prosecute those responsible for forced begging and to\ncarry out \" daara modernization \" - ensuring that the schools meet basic international standards of\neducation and child protection.\n50. The government must enforce its own laws to protect talibés from this abuse and ensure that the\neducation received in daaras equips these children with a rounded education, and does not allow forced\nbegging. The Senegalese government enacted legislation in 2005 that criminalized forcing others into\nbegging for personal financial gain. But the authorities have largely failed to take concrete steps to enforce\nthe law and end the exploitation and abuse of the talibés . Therefore, the Government of Senegal has\nviolated the right to education of the talibés by failing to ensure the availability, accessibility and\nacceptability of the education and supervising the daaras .\nD. Alleged violation of Article 14 (health and health services)\n\n51. The Charter under Article 14 provides that State Parties should take measures to ensure the provision\nof necessary medical assistance and health care to all children with emphasis on the development of\nprimary health care; and to ensure the provision of adequate nutrition and safe drinking water . In Purohit\n&Moore V The Gambia the Commission stated that:\nEnjoyment of human right to health as it is widely known is vital to all aspects of a person's life and\nwellbeing and is crucial to the realization of all the other fundamental human rights and freedoms. This right\nincludes the right to health facilities, access to goods and services to be guaranteed to all without\ndiscrimination of any kind. 34\n52. The efforts undertaken by the State Party in realizing this right should be directed towards the\nprevention of diseases and health problems, and the provision of the necessary health care services. In\nensuring adequate nutrition and safe drinking water to all children, the CRC committee emphasized that\nschool feeding programmes, and the provision of safe and clean drinking water are essential to combat\ndisease and malnutrition. 35 Failure to provide safe drinking water amounts to a violation of the right to the\nbest attainable health under the Charter. 36\n53. Looking at the case under consideration, the poor conditions in the daara , combined with a lack of\nclothes and shoes for the long days on the street, increase the vulnerability of the talibés to different forms\nof health challenges. Forced to beg for food, many are also extremely malnourished. The Committee notes\nthat when the talibés get sick their marabout rarely provides medicines, in some instances requiring them to\nbeg even greater hours in order to pay for their own treatment. More often, despite their ill health the talibés\ncontinue begging to satisfy the quota.\n\n9\n\n\f54. The Respondent State has the obligation to assure that children are not deprived of access to health\ncare services. It should further take all the necessary steps to avert any kind of institutional, cultural and\nfinancial obstacle to accessing health care services. 37 The State should not tolerate any practice which\nviolates the right to health of children. 38 It must assert that third parties do not deprive children of their right\nto access medical service.\n55. As submitted by the complainants, the talibés are not practically entitled to adequate sanitation and\nnutrition which in effect endangers their health. The Committee notes that the marabouts as caregivers\nhave failed to ensure that the talibés get medical service.\n56. Hence the Committee concluded that the Respondent State has failed to provide the necessary\nsanitation and nutrition to the talibés and it has also failed to take measures against the marabouts , who\naccommodate talibés in squalid health conditions. The Respondent State has not taken appropriate steps\nwithin its available resource to prevent disease and malnutrition, as well as to avoid barriers to access the\nhealth services of those children in need of medical care. Therefore, the Committee finds the Respondent\nState in violation of Article 14 of the Charter.\nE. Alleged violation of Article 15 (child labour)\n\n57. The Complainants allege that the urban talibés are an identifiable group of children vulnerable to be\nexploited for the worst forms of child labour. Accordingly they submit that the number of hours the children\nspent per day begging, the beatings for not bringing a sufficient quota of goods per day and the health and\nsafety risks caused by standing in busy streets is contrary to international laws which categorize child\nbegging as a practice of exploitive labour. 39\n58. Art 15 of the African Children's Charter obliges State Parties to take legislative and administrative\nmeasures for the formal and informal employment sector to protect children from all types of economic\nexploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with their physical,\nmental, spiritual, moral or social development. Further the International Labour Organization's (ILO)\nConvention 182 under Art 1\n× Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall take immediate and effective measures to secure the\nprohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour as a matter of urgency.\nand 9\n× The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the\nInternational Labour Office for registration.\nrequires States to ensure the effective abolition of child labour and implementation of the Convention.\n59. In the case at hand, contrary what is prescribed under the regional and international instruments, the\nCommittee notes that many marabous force the talibés to beg on the streets for long hours-a practice that\nmeets the ILO definition of a worst form of child labor. The Committee is of the view that the forced\nbegging, physical abuse, and dangerous daily living conditions endured by these talibés violate domestic\nand international law. Despite being party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter\non the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and all major international and regional treaties on child labor and\ntrafficking, which provide clear prohibitions against the worst forms of child labor, physical violence, and\ntrafficking, Senegal has scantily enforced the laws.\n60. The Committee notes that in the last decade, the government has notably defined forced begging as a\nworst form of child labor and criminalized forcing another into begging for economic gain, but this adequate\nlegislation has so far led to little concrete action. No marabout was held accountable for forced begging,\ngross neglect, and severe physical abuse against the talibés .\n61. In view of this, the Committee believes that forced begging places children in a harmful situation on the\nstreet and therefore meets the ILO's definition of a worst form of child labor. Moreover, the Committee\n10\n\n\fnotes that the forced begging and gross neglect is done with a view toward exploitation, with the marabout\nreceiving the child from his/her parents and profiting from the child's labor, which resulted in continuous\nsuffering oftens of thousands of talibés in Senegal. Though the Respondent State has ratified international\nlaws and prohibits the act of child begging under its national law, it has failed to take any effective\nadministrative measures against the marabouts and to protect the talibés from exploitation. Therefore, the\nGovernment of Senegal has violated Article 15(2) of the African Children's Charter which requires the State\nParty to take appropriate administrative measures to ensure the full protection of children from child labor\nhaving regard to the relevant provisions of the ILO's instruments.\nF. Alleged violation of Article 16 (protection against child abuse and torture)\n\n62. In this communication the Complainants submit that the fact that the talibés are regularly subjected to\nbeatings and fear in cases where they do not reach the minimum daily begging quota, leads to high levels\nof stress and anxiety which amounts to violation of their right to be protected from abuse and torture under\nArt 16 of the African Children's Charter.\n63. Considering the complaint, the Committee notes that as prescribed under the African Children's\nCharter, protecting children from abuse and torture requires States to adopt legislative, administrative,\nsocial and educational measures through effective establishment of special monitoring units to provide\nnecessary support for the child and for those who have the care of the child, as well as other forms of\nprevention and identification, reporting referral investigation, treatment, and follow-up of instances of child\nabuse and neglect.\n64. Taking into consideration the elements of the provision of the law and the acts as alleged by the\nComplainants, the Committee discusses whether the beatings committed by marabouts amounts to child\nabuse and torture. In this regard the Committee refers to the jurisprudences of the ACHPR. In Curtis\nFrancis Doebbler v Sudan the African Commission found the act of lashing as it constitutes a cruel\ntreatment. 40 Moreover, in International Pen and Others v Nigeria , the ACHPR defines inhumane and\ndegrading treatment to include not only actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering, but\nwhich humiliate the individual or force him or her to act against his will or conscience . 41\n65. In the case at hand, the Committee notes that the beating of the talibés qualifies as a physical\npunishment since physical force is used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort for not\nbringing the required quota. There are also reported cases where talibés typically described being taken to\na room, stripped of their shirt, and beaten with an electric cable or a club. 42 In some instances the beatings\nand physical abuse may rise to the level of torture under the Convention against Torture. According to the\nConvention torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is\nintentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a\nconfession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having\ncommitted, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of\nany kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or\nacquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity 43 .\n66. With regard to the accountability of State actors for acts committed by non-state actors, the Committee\nrefers to the explanation given by the Committee on the Convention against Torture. The Committee on the\nConvention against Torture states that where state authorities or others acting in official capacity or under\ncolour of law, know or have reasonable grounds to believe that acts of torture or ill-treatment are being\ncommitted by non-State officials or private actors and they fail to exercise due diligence to prevent,\ninvestigate, prosecute and punish such non-State officials or private actors consistently with the\nConvention, the State bears responsibility and its officials should be considered as authors, complicit or\notherwise responsible under the Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in such impermissible act . 44\n67. Legislative, administrative, social and educational measures are the means through which States can\nfulfill their obligation to protect children from any form of violence. 45 Although there are legislative and\n11\n\n\fsocial initiatives in Senegal to protect the rights of children in general, the government failed to take specific\nadministrative and judicial measures against the marabouts . The Respondent State did not deny the fact\nthat since 2010 only 10 cases have been brought against marabouts who exploits children resulting in only\nnine convictions. Apart from the social term orientation for children in the street and destitute families and\n24 Department Committees for the Protection of the Child (CDPE), 46 the Committee notes that there are\nno educational and sufficient social measures that aim at changing the situation of the talibés .\n68. As the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has stated that the prohibition against physical and\nmental violence also applies to corporal punishment in schools. 47 The physical abuse likewise places the\nmarabout in conflict with Senegal's penal code, which provides particular care to children. 48 The severe\nphysical abuse that many marabouts inflict on the talibés , as well as the looming threat of violence,\ntherefore violates the children's right to freedom from physical and mental violence and abuse and torture.\nThe Government of Senegal therefore is in clear violation of Article 16 of the African Children's Charter\nwhich requires the State Party to protect children from physical, mental, injury, abuse, neglect,\nmaltreatment and torture.\nG. Alleged violation of Article 21 (protection against harmful social and cultural practices)\n\n69. According to Article 21(1)(a) of the African Children's Charter, States Parties are under obligation to\ntake measures towards the elimination of harmful social and cultural practices which endanger the health or\nlife of the child. Furthermore, Article 1(3) of the Charter provides that:\nAny custom, tradition, culture or religious practice that is inconsistent with the rights, duties and obligations\ncontained in the present Charter shall to the extent of such inconsistency be discouraged.\n70. A harmful practice, according to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the\nConvention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), should meet the\nfollowing criteria;\n\n1. They constitute a denial of the dignity and/or integrity of the individual and a violation of human\nrights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the two Conventions;\n2. They constitute discrimination against women or children and are harmful insofar as they result in\nnegative consequences for them as individuals or groups, including physical, psychological,\neconomic and social harm and/or violence and limitations on their capacity to participate fully in\nsociety or develop and reach their full potential;\n3. They are traditional, re-emerging or emerging practices that are prescribed and/or kept in place by\nsocial norms that perpetuate male dominance and inequality of women and children, based on sex,\ngender, age and other intersecting factors;\n4. They are imposed on women and children by family, community members, or society at large,\nregardless of whether the victim provides, or is able to provide, full, free and informed consent.\n49\n\n71. Therefore, States Parties must take legislative, administrative and other appropriate measures to\nabolish any practice inconsistent with the Charter. Using children in any form of begging is one form of\nharmful practice which is clearly prohibited under Article 29 of the African Children's Charter; and the State\nmust take all the necessary steps to restrict such practice.\n72. Even though the Respondent State has outlawed the practice of forced begging under Article 3 of Law\nNo. 2005-06, the talibés are still being forced to beg and bring back to the daaras a daily quota the failure\nof which incurs punishment. The State has not taken any measures against these schools. The talibés are\nrequired to bring a daily quota, in order to fulfill their quota they have to beg on the street where they will be\nexposed to exploitation. The forced begging has compromised their right to life and development as they\n12\n\n\fare often injured from traffic accidents. Moreover, this cultural practice by the marabouts causes the\nviolation of other provisions of the Charter. The talibés are not enjoying their legal right to play, leisure and\ncultural activities which can advance their mental and psychological developments. This activity of begging\nis deep rooted in the Qur'anic schools and the Committee is of the view that it is a harmful practice.\n73. The government of Senegal has failed to take measures against the marabouts , to monitor the\nsituation of children in the Qur'anic schools, and to ensure that the talibés are getting the necessary\neducation to which they are entitled. Even though the marabouts are non-state actors, the State of Senegal\nis responsible for the violation caused by such actors due to its obligation to protect the rights of children.\nThe Committee thus finds a violation of Article 21(1) of the African Children's Charter by the Respondent\nState.\nH. Alleged violation of Article 29 (sale, trafficking and abduction, and using children in the form of begging)\n\n74. Citing Article 29 of the African Children's Charter, the complainants argued that the State Party has\nviolated the Charter which expressly forbids forced begging and States Parties to take appropriate\nmeasures to prevent the abduction, the sale of, or traffic of children for any purpose or in any form, by any\nperson including parents or legal guardians of the child; and the use of children in all forms of begging. The\ncomplainants also made reference to the ILO Conventions which make it clear that states are responsible\nfor the prevention of child labour through effective enforcement. Further, they expressly state that work akin\nto slavery (which includes trafficking of children and compulsory labour) and work that harms the health,\nsafety or morals of children comprises the worst forms of child labour. 50\n75. Considering the alleged fact, the Committee finds it important to expound on what amounts to child\nsale, trafficking and abduction. The Committee notes that children are one of the most vulnerable groups\ntargeted for the trafficking in human beings. Children are trafficked as they can be easily recruited and\nquickly replaced. The exploitation of children violates the human rights of children to have a safe childhood\nin their family setting, to receive education, to have time to play and to be protected from exploitation. Child\ntrafficking involves the recruitment of victims, their transportation, transfer and harbouring of children for the\npurpose of exploitation. Coercion, violence or threats are not necessary elements in cases of child\ntrafficking as children cannot consent. 51 Children are trafficked for the same purposes as adults: for sexual\nexploitation, for labour exploitation but also for exploitation in a range of criminal activities, including\nbegging.\n76. The use of children in all forms of begging is strictly forbidden under Article 29(b) of the Africa\nChildren's Charter. Article 29(a) in addition prohibits trafficking of children for any purpose in any form. In\nthis regard, the Committee refers to the definition provided by the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC). Under Article 3 the Protocol defines trafficking\nas;\n[T]he recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use\nof force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a\nposition of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a\nperson having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a\nminimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or\nservices, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs\n77. The Ouagadougou Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, Especially Women and\nChildren as adopted by the African Union Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development, Tripoli,\n22-23 November 2006, also conceptualizes trafficking in persons as it happens within and between states,\nurges States to take measures to eliminate harmful customs and traditional practices, including forced child\nbegging, which can lead to trafficking in human beings, including children.\n\n13\n\n\f78. Looking at the case at hand, the Committee realized that the talibés are forcibly subjected to economic\nexploitation through forced labour; and they are used for begging by the marabouts . Given the ILO's views\non forced begging, the Committee concludes that marabouts , when transporting talibés with the primary\nintention of obtaining labour from them, are engaging in child trafficking. Article 3(c) of the Trafficking in\nPersons Protocol includes in the definition of trafficking in persons the recruitment, transportation, transfer,\nharbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation.\n79. Moreover, the Committee learns from reports that only about half the talibés in Senegal are\nSenegalese. The rest are trafficked from neighboring countries, including Guinea Bissau and Mali, where\npoor families are promised their sons will be remunerated as they will receive a proper Islamic education\nunder the care of a marabout at the daaras . The boys often have no contact with their families once they\nleave home, and because most do not know anyone in Senegal, they become entirely reliant on marabout\nfor food, health care and shelter.\n80. These acts, according to the Committee violate the children's rights to be protected from sale, trafficking\nand abduction. The Respondent State has not contested this allegation of the Complainants. The\nCommittee has observed that the Respondent State has taken legislative measures against begging and\ntrafficking. However, the Committee is of the view that legislative measures alone cannot sufficiently protect\nthe rights of children; and the State Party should also take administrative and other appropriate measures\nto ensure that children are not subjected to begging or trafficking as stipulated under Article 1 of the\nCharter. Reaffirming this position in Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum v Zimbabwe , 52 the ACHPR\nstates that an act by a private individual or (non-state actor) and therefore not directly imputable to a state,\ncan generate responsibility of the State, not because of the act itself, but because of the lack of due\ndiligence on the part of the state to prevent the violation or for not taking the necessary steps to provide the\nvictims with reparation. 53\n81. The Committee, therefore, has found the Respondent State in violation of Article 29 of the African\nChildren's' Charter which with no exception prohibits forced begging and requires States Parties to take\nappropriate measures to prevent the abduction, the sale of, or trafficking of children.\n\nDecision of the African Committee\n\n82. Because of the foregoing reasons, the Committee finds multiple violations of the African Children's\nCharter as follows: Article 4 (best interest of the child); Article 5 (survival and development); Article 11 (the\nright to education); Article 14 (health and health services); Article 15 (child labour); Article 29 (sale,\ntrafficking and abduction); Article 16 (protection against child abuse and torture); and {[21,Article 21}}\n(protection against harmful social and cultural practices). Therefore, the Committee recommends that the\nRespondent State should, in accordance with its obligations under the African Children's Charter,\nundertake the necessary measures:\n\n1. To ensure that all talibés are immediately taken back from the streets to their families;\n2. Through cooperation with the neighboring countries (from where some of the children are coming),\ninternational and national organisations, facilitate the reunion of the talibés with their families; [[/li]]\n3. To establish functioning and effective institutions and mechanisms to provide the talibés with shortand long-term, appropriate psychological, medical and social assistance in order to promote their\nfull recovery;\n4. To establish minimum norms and standards for all daaras relating to health, safety, hygiene,\neducation content and quality, and accommodation;\n5. To integrate the daaras into the formal education system;\n6. To inspect the daaras regularly to ensure that standards set out in the Charter and local legislation\nare complied with and close all the daaras which are not in compliance with the required standards;\n7. With a view of fighting impunity and preventing forced begging, sale, abduction and trafficking of\nchildren, ensure that all the perpetrators are brought to justice and held accountable for their actions\n14\n\n\fwith penalties commensurate with the severity of their crimes;\n8. On the talibés right to education: [list=i]\n9. Make sure that education contributes in promoting and developing their personality, talents and their\nphysical and mental abilities to their fullest potential,\n10. The Government's education policy should be reviewed in light of fostering respect for human rights\nand fundamental freedoms, and\n11. Ensure the provision of free and compulsory basic education.\n[*] To train law enforcement and judicial personnel, social workers, traditional and religious leaders, parents\nand the community at large on children's rights in general and prohibitions of child begging in particular; [*]\nTo conduct joint studies with the concerned neighboring State Parties on the situation of talibés' children in\nSenegal and countries of origin; [*] To fully recognize and implement the rights included in the African\nChildren's Charter and in other international instruments; [*] While complying with its reporting obligation in\naccordance with article 43 of the African Children's Charter, the State Party should provide the Committee\nwith sufficient information on the progress of implementation of the current decision [*] To cooperate with\nthe African Union, International and National Organisations, the UN Agencies, particularly UNICEF, ILO,\nWorld Health organisation (WHO), with a view to fully implement these recommendations and alleviate the\nchallenges of talibés in Senegal; and [*] As per Section XXI (1) of the Revised Communication Guidelines\nof the Committee, the Government shall report to the Committee on all measures taken to implement the\ndecision of the Committee within 180 days from the date of receipt of the Committee's decision.

These communications were submitted to the African Commission by International Pen, the\nConstitutional Rights Project, INTERIGHTS [and Civil Liberties Organisation] respectively. They were\njoined because they all concern the detention and trial of Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa, a writer and Ogoni\nactivist, president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People. The communications 139/94 and\n154/96 also complain of similar human rights violations suffered by Mr Saro-Wiwa's co-defendants, also\nOgoni leaders.\n2. The communications 137/94 and 139/94 were submitted in 1994 before any trial began. After the murder\nof four Ogoni leaders on 21st May 1994, following riot during a public meeting organised by Movement for\nthe Survival of the Ogoni Peoples (MOSOP) representing the rights of those who lived in oil producing\nareas of Ogoni land, Saro-Wiwa and many hundreds of others were arrested, Saro-Wiwa himself on 22nd\nMay 1994 and the vice-president of MOSOP, Ledum Mitee, shortly thereafter. Both communications allege\nthat Mr Saro-Wiwa was severely beaten during the first days of his detention and was held for several days\nin leg irons and handcuffs. He was also denied access to his lawyer and the medicine he needed to control\nhis blood pressure, at times prevented from seeing his family, and held in very poor conditions.\n3. In its communication, submitted on 9th September 1994, the Constitutional Rights Project included a list\nof 16 other Ogonis who had been held without charge or bail for what was at that time over three months.\nBoth communications alleged that Mr Saro-Wiwa had been detained because of his political work in relation\nto MOSOP. He had been detained five times for brief periods since the beginning of 1993, and released\neach time without charge, except on one occasion in mid-1993 where he was held for several weeks and\ncharged with unlawful assembly.\n4. The State Military Administrator declared that Mr Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants had incited members\nof MOSOP to murder four rival Ogoni leaders, but no charges were brought until 28th January 1995. In the\nmonths between arrest and the beginning of the trial, the defendants were not allowed to meet with their\nlawyers, and no information on the charges was provided to the defence.\n5. In February 1995 the trial of the defendants began before a tribunal established under the Civil\nDisturbances Act. The three members of this tribunal were appointed directly by General Abacha in\nNovember 1994, although counsel for the Rivers State Administrator argued in August that the cases were\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the Rivers State High Court, since Rivers State is where the offences\noccurred.\n6. In June 1995 the Constitutional Rights Project submitted a supplement to its communication, alleging\nirregularities in the conduct of the trial itself: harassment of defence counsel, a military officer's presence at\nwhat should have been confidential meetings between defendants and their counsel, bribery of witnesses,\nand evidence of bias on the part of the tribunal members themselves. In October 1995 PEN also copied to\nthe Commission a letter it sent to General Abacha protesting the lack of concrete evidence and the unfair\nconduct of the trial.\n7. On 30th and 31st October 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of the co-defendants (Saturday Dobee, Felix\nNuate, Nordu Eawo, Paul Levura, Daniel Gbokoo, Barinem Kiobel, John Kpunien and Baribor Bera) were\nsentenced to death, while six others including Mr Mitee were acquitted. The CRP submitted an emergency\nsupplement to its communication on 2nd November 1995, asking the Commission to adopt provisional\nmeasures to prevent the executions.\n8. The Secretariat of the Commission faxed a Note Verbale invoking interim measures under revised Rule\n111 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria, the Secretary\nGeneral of the OAU, the Special Advisor (Legal) to the Head of State, the Ministry of Justice of Nigeria, and\nthe Nigerian High Commission in The Gambia. The Note Verbale pointed out that as the case of Mr\nSaro-Wiwa and the others was already before the Commission, and the government of Nigeria had invited\nthe Commission to undertake a mission to that country, during which mission the communications would be\n1\n\n\fdiscussed, the executions should be delayed until the Commission had discussed the case with the\nNigerian authorities.\n9. No response to this appeal was received before the executions were carried out.\n10. On 7th November 1995 the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) confirmed the sentences of death and on\n10th November 1995 all the accused persons were executed in secret at the Port Harcourt Prison. By\nsection 7 of the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunals) Decree No. 2 of 1987, under which the executed\npersons were tried, the PRC are required to receive the records of the trial Tribunal before confirmation of\nthe decision is possible. These records were not prepared by the Tribunal and so were not available for the\nPRC.\n11. In 1996 the Secretariat received a communication from INTERIGHTS representing Ken Saro-Wiwa Jr.\nIt alleged that the condemned persons had been detained arbitrarily prior to and during the trial and that\nthey had been subjected to torture in the Army camp. Furthermore it alleged serious irregularities\nconcerning the conduct of the trial: that the tribunals that convicted the accused persons were not\nindependent; that there was no presumption of innocence; that the accused persons had not been given\ntime or facilities in which to prepare their defence; that they had been denied legal representation by a\ncounsel of their choice; that there was no right of appeal and that following the sentencing the persons\nwere held incommunicado. INTERIGHTS asserted that they were tried, convicted and sentenced to death\nfor the peaceful expression of their views and opinions on the violations of the rights of the Ogoni people.\n12. In December 1996 the Secretariat received a communication from the Civil Liberties Organisation,\nalleging that the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunal) Decree is invalid because it was made without\nparticipation of the people; that its composition with military officers and members of the Provisional Ruling\nCouncil meant that it could not be impartial; and that the lack of judicial review of the decisions of this\ntribunal amount to a violation of the right to appeal and fair trial. The communication alleges that the trial,\nconviction and sentencing of Ken Saro-Wiwa and others violated Articles 7(1) (b), 7(1) (c) and 7(1)(d) of\nthe African Charter, and that the execution of these persons violates Article 4. The communication alleges\nthat the arraignment of 19 more alleged suspects constitutes another potential violation of the Charter.\n\nComplaint\n13. The communications allege violation of Articles 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16 and 26 of the African Charter.\nThe State response and observations\n\n14. The government argues that its actions were necessary to protect the rights of the citizens who had\nbeen murdered; that the tribunal which tried Saro-Wiwa was competent because two of its three members\nwere lawyers; that the process of confirmation by a state government was an adequate appeal; that the\nCivil Disturbances Decree had not been protested upon its enactment in 1987 and that it had been set up\nto deal with a crisis situation.\n\nProcedure before the Commission\n15. Communication 137/94 is dated 28th September 1994 and was submitted by International Pen.\n16. Communication 139/94 is submitted by Constitutional Rights Project and dated 9th September 1994.\n17. The Commission was seized of the communications at its 16th Session in October 1994, but deferred its\ndecision on admissibility pending notification and receipt of additional information from the Nigerian\nGovernment.\n18. At the 16th session the Commission decided to merge the communications.\n19. On 9th November 1994, a notification of the two communications was sent to the Nigerian Government\nand Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure was invoked, requesting the Nigerian Government not to cause\nirreparable prejudice to Mr. Saro-Wiwa.\n20. On 6th February 1995 a letter was received from International Pen stating that Mr Saro-Wiwa was being\nill-treated and that he was facing the death penalty.\n21. On 13th February a letter was sent to the Nigerian Government re-emphasising the need for Rule 109 to\nbe applied.\n22. On 22nd February 1995, a letter was received from Complainants stating that Ken Saro-Wiwa had been\ncharged and was scheduled to appear before a three person tribunal from which there was no right of\n2\n\n\fappeal. The tribunal members are chosen by General Abacha in violation of international fair trial\nstandards. The complainant recognised that local remedies had yet to be exhausted and announced its\nintention to present an update of the case to the Commission once the trial was completed.\n23. At the 17th Session the Commission declared the communications admissible. They were to be heard\non their merits at the 18th Session.\n24. On 20th April 1995, letters were sent to the Government of Nigeria and the complainants informing them\nof this.\n25. On 28th June 1995 a letter was received from the Constitutional Rights Project describing developments\nin the case.\n26. On 1st September 1995, a letter was sent to the government of Nigeria stating that the communication\nwould be heard on the merits at the 18th Session of the Commission and inviting the government to send a\nrepresentative.\n27. At the 18th Session the Commission decided that the communications should be taken up by the\nmission planned for Nigeria.\n28. On 9th October 1995 a letter was received from PEN American Centre expressing concern for the state\nof health of Mr Saro-Wiwa.\n29. On 1st November 1995, upon hearing that a death sentence had been passed on Mr Saro-Wiwa and\neight of his co-defendants, the Secretariat faxed a Note Verbale to the government of Nigeria, invoking the\nrevised Rule 111 of Procedure (formerly 109) asking that the executions should be delayed until the\nCommission had taken its mission and spoken with the competent authorities. This Note Verbale was also\nfaxed to the Secretary General of the OAU, the Nigerian High Commission in Banjul, and the Special\nAdviser (Legal) to the Head of State of Nigeria.\n30. On 2nd November 1995 a letter was received from the Constitutional Rights Project notifying the\nSecretariat of the death sentences and requesting that provisional measures be invoked.\n31. On 9th November 1995 Commissioner Dankwa, hearing that the death sentence had been confirmed,\nwrote to the Secretariat requesting such action. He was faxed a copy of the Note Verbale.\n32. On 20th November 1995 the Secretariat received a Note Verbale from the Nigerian High Commissioner\nin Banjul, attempting to justify the executions.\n33. On 21st November 1995 the Secretariat wrote a Note Verbale to the Nigerian High Commission in\nBanjul, requesting the official judgement in the Saro-Wiwa case, which had been mentioned in the Note\nVerbale.\n34. On 30th November 1995 a letter was sent to the Complainants stating that the communications would\nbe taken up by the Commission's mission to Nigeria.\n35. On 13th December 1995, the Secretariat received a letter dated 13th November 1995 from the office of\nthe Special Adviser to the Head of State, attempting to justify the executions.\n36. On 18th and 19th December 1995, the Commission held an extraordinary session on Nigeria in\nKampala.\n37. On 26th January 1996 a letter was sent to the Constitutional Rights Project informing it of the interim\nmeasures taken with regard to Ken Saro-Wiwa.\n38. At the 19th Session, held in March/April 1996 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, the Commission heard\nstatements from the government of Nigeria and the Complainants. Mr Chidi Anselm Odinkalu was duly\nauthorised to appear for the Complainants, and Mr Osah and Mr Bello appeared for the Nigerian\nGovernment. At the end of the hearing the Commission took a general view on the cases and deferred\ntaking final decision in each case pending the accomplishment of its proposed mission to Nigeria. The\nCommission proposed May 1996 as the dates for the visit. The Nigerian delegation said they will\ncommunicate these dates to the Government of Nigeria for confirmation.\n39. On 8th May 1996 the Commission wrote to the Nigerian Government, Constitutional Rights Project and\nInternational PEN informing them that a decision had been taken at the 19th Session to send a mission to\nthe country where the cases would be taken up.\n40. At the 20th Session held in Grand Bay, Mauritius, October 1996, the Commission decided to postpone\nthe final decision on the merits of the communications to the next session, awaiting the result of the\nplanned mission to Nigeria. The Commission also decided to join communication 154/96 with these\ncommunications.\n41. On 10th December 1996 the Secretariat sent letters to the Complainants informing them of the\ndecisions of the Commission.\n\n3\n\n\f42. On 10th December 1996 the Secretariat sent a Note Verbale to the government informing it of the\ndecisions of the Commission.\n43. On 29th April, the Secretariat received a letter from Mr Olisa Agbakoba entitled 'Preliminary objections\nand observations to the Mission of the Commission which visited Nigeria from March 7th-14th 1997. The\ndocument was submitted on behalf of INTERIGTS with regard to 14 communications, including this one.\n44. Among the objections raised and or observations made were: a) \"the neutrality, credibility and\nrelevance; and composition of the mission\".\n45. At its 21st Session held in April 1997, the Commission postponed taking decision on the Merits to the\nnext session, pending the submission of scholarly article and court decisions by the complainants to assist\nit in its decision. The Commission also awaits further analysis of its report of the mission to Nigeria. It must\nbe stated that Mr Chidi Odinkalu did send the article mentioned above.\n46. On 22nd May, the Complainants were informed of the Commission's decision, while the State was\ninformed on May 28th.\n47. Communication 154/96 is dated 6th November 1995 and received at the Secretariat on 4th March 1996.\n48. The communication requested the Commission to take interim measures to prevent the executions. A\nsupplementary submission was sent with the communication informing the Commission that the executions\nhad taken place on 10th November but that the communication was reaffirmed.\n49. On 13th November 1995 the Nigerian Government wrote to the Commission informing it of the\nGovernment's view of the situation.\n50. On 20th November 1995 the High Commission of Nigeria in The Gambia giving its opinion on the\nmatter.\n51. On 21st November 1995 the Commission wrote to the High Commission of Nigeria in The Gambia\nrequesting a copy of the Justice's judgement in the case.\n52. On 12th March 1996 a confirmation was sent to this effect by the Complainant.\n53. At the 19th Session in March 1996 the communication was not considered, but the Commission took a\ngeneral view of all the communications against Nigeria and deferred any decision on cases pending the\naccomplishment of its proposed mission to Nigeria.\n54. On 13th August 1996 a complete copy of the communication was sent to the government of Nigeria.\n55. On 13th August 1996 a letter was sent to the Complainant informing him of the status of the case.\n56. On 4th February 1997, the Secretariat received a letter entitled supplementary submissions with respect\nto communication No. 154/96.\n57. On 4th April, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the letter.\n58. On 29th April, the Secretariat received a letter from Mr Olisa Agbakoba entitled 'Preliminary objections\nand observations' to the Mission of the Commission which visited Nigeria from March 7th-14th 1997. The\ndocument was submitted on behalf of INTERIGHTS with regard to 14 communications, including this one.\n59. Among the objections raised and or observations made were: a) the neutrality, credibility and\nrelevance; and composition of the mission\".\n60. At its 21st Session held in April 1997, the Commission postponed taking decision on the merits to the\nnext session, pending the submission of scholarly articles and court case by the Complainants to assist it in\nits decision. The Commission also awaits further analysis of its report of the mission to Nigeria.\n61. On 22nd May, the Complainants were informed of the Commission's decision, while the State was\ninformed on May 28th.\n62. On May 27th, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant entitled 'Additional Information on\nOuster Clauses in Nigerian Law' in which he promised to furnish the Secretariat with the information\nrequested by the Commission at its 21st Session \"within the next three weeks\".\n63. From this day on the procedure is identical to communications 137/94 and 139/94.\n64. Communication 161/97 was received on 10th January 1997.\n65. On 14th January 1997 a Note Verbale with a copy of the communication was sent to the Ministry of\nExternal Affairs, copy to the Special Legal Adviser to the Head of State, the Nigerian High Commission,\nand the Embassy of Nigeria in Addis Ababa.\n66. On 23rd January 1997 an acknowledgement of receipt was sent to the Complainant.\n67. At its 21st Session held in April 1997, the Commission postponed taking decision on the merits to the\nnext session, pending the submission of scholarly articles and court case by the Complainants to assist it in\nits decision. The Commission also awaits further analysis of its report of the mission to Nigeria.\n68. On 22nd May, the Complainants were informed of the Commission's decision, while the State was\ninformed on May 28th.\n4\n\n\f69. At the 22nd Ordinary Session, the Commission postponed taking a decision on the cases pending the\ndiscussion of the Nigerian Mission report.\n70. At the 23rd Ordinary Session held in Banjul The Gambia, from 20th-29th April 1998, the Commission was\nunable to consider the communication due to lack of time.\n71. On 25th June 1998, letters were sent from the Secretariat of the Commission to all parties concerned\nregarding the status of the communications.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n72. Article 56 of the African Charter reads:\nCommunications...shall be considered if they: ...5. Are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it\nis obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged...\n73. This is just one of the 7 conditions specified by Article 56, but it is that which usually requires the most\nattention. Because Article 56 is necessarily the first considered by the Commission, before any substantive\nconsideration of communications, it has already been the subject of substantial interpretation; in the\njurisprudence of the African Commission, there are several important precedents.\n74. Specifically, in the four decisions the Commission has already taken concerning Nigeria, Article 56(5) is\nanalysed in terms of the Nigerian context. Communication 60/91 (Decision ACHPR/60/91) concerned the\nRobbery and Firearms Tribunal; Communication 87/93 (Decision ACHPR/87/93) concerned the Civil\nDisturbances Tribunal; Communication 101/93 (Decision ACHPR/101/93) concerned the Legal\nPractitioners Decree; and Communication 129/94 (ACHPR/129/94) concerned the Constitution\n(Modification and Suspension) Decree and the Political Parties (Dissolution) Decree.\n75. All of the Decrees in question in the above communications contain \"ouster\" clauses. In the case of the\nspecial tribunals, these clauses prevent the ordinary courts from taking up cases placed before the special\ntribunals or from entertaining any appeals from the decisions of the special tribunals. ( ACHPR/60/91:13\nand ACHPR/87/93:13). The Legal Practitioners Decree specifies that it cannot not be challenged in the\ncourts and that anyone attempting to do so commits a crime ( ACHPR/129/94:14 and ACHPR/129/94:15 ).\nThe Constitution Suspension and Modification legally prohibited their challenge in the Nigerian Courts (\nACHPR/129/94:14 and ACHPR/129/94:15).\n76. In all of the cases cited above, the Commission found that the ouster clauses render local remedies\nnon-existent, ineffective or illusory. They create a legal situation in which the judiciary can provide no check\non the executive branch of government. A few courts in the Lagos district have occasionally found that they\nhave jurisdiction; in 1995 the Court of Appeal in Lagos, relying on common law, found that courts should\nexamine some decrees notwithstanding ouster clauses, where the decree is \"offensive and utterly hostile to\nrationality\" (Reprinted in the Constitutional Rights Journal). It remains to be seen whether any Nigerian\ncourts will be courageous enough to follow this holding, and whether the government will abide by their\nrulings should they do so.\n77. In the present case, while the above reasoning was used in the initial decisions on admissibility, it is at\nthe present time unnecessary. In light of the fact that the subjects of the communications are now\ndeceased, it is evident that no domestic remedy can now give the complainants the satisfaction they seek.\nThe communications are thus admissible.\nMerits\n78. Article 5 of the Charter reads:\nEvery individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being and to the\nrecognition of his legal status. All forms of exploitation and degradation of man particularly slavery, slave\ntrade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and treatment shall be prohibited.\n79. Article 5 prohibits not only torture, but also cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. This includes not\nonly actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering, but which humiliate the individual or\nforce him or her to act against his will or conscience.\n5\n\n\f80. International PEN alleges that Ken Saro-Wiwa was kept in leg irons and handcuffs and subjected to\nill-treatment including beatings and being held in cells which were airless and dirty, then denied medical\nattention, during the first days of his arrest. There was no evidence of any violent action on his part or\nescape attempts that would justify holding him in irons. Communication 154/96 alleges that all the victims\nwere manacled in their cells, beaten and chained to the walls in their cells.\n81. The government has made no written submission in these cases, and has not refuted these allegations\nin its oral presentation. It is well-established jurisprudence of the Commission that where allegations go\nentirely unchallenged, it will proceed to decide on the facts presented (See, e.g., the Commission's\ndecisions in communications 59/91, 60/91, 64/92, 68/92, 78/92, 87/93 and 101/93). Thus, the\nCommission holds a violation of Article 5 of the Charter.\n82. Article 6 of the African Charter reads:\nEvery individual shall have the right to liberty and to the security of his person. No one may be deprived of\nhis freedom except for reasons and conditions previously laid down by law. In particular, no one may be\narbitrarily arrested or detained.\n83. All the victims were arrested and kept in detention for a lengthy period under the State Security\n(Detention of Persons) Act of 1984 and State Security (Detention of Persons ) Amended Decree No. 14\n(1994), that stipulates that the government can detain people without charge for as long as three months in\nthe first instance. The decree also states that the courts cannot question any such detention or in any other\nway intervene on behalf of the detainees. This decree allows the government to arbitrarily hold people\ncritical of the government for up to 3 months without having to explain themselves and without any\nopportunity for the complainant to challenge the arrest and detention before a court of law. The decree\ntherefore prima facie violates the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained protected in Article 6.\n84. The government has made no defence of this decree, either for its general validity or its justice as\napplied in this case. Thus, the Commission holds a violation of Article 6.\n85. Article 7 of the African Charter reads:\n1. Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This comprises:\nthe right to appeal to competent national organs against acts of violating his fundamental rights;\nthe right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\nthe right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;\nthe right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\n86. As regards the conduct of the trial itself, it is unnecessary for the Commission to delve into the specific\ncircumstances, because by the Commission's own precedent the tribunal was defective. As will be recalled,\nin its decision on Communication 87/93, the Commission considered that special tribunals established\nunder the Civil Disturbances Act violate Article 7(1)(d) of the African Charter, because their composition is\nat the discretion of the executive branch. Removing cases from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and\nplacing them before an extension of the executive branch necessarily compromises their impartiality, which\nis required by the African Charter. This violation of the impartiality of tribunals occurs in principle,\nregardless of the qualifications of the individuals chosen for a particular tribunal.\n87. The Note Verbale of the Nigerian High Commissioner in The Gambia points out that the tribunal was\nnot a military one, but was presided over by a judge of the Nigerian Court of Appeal, and that tribunals are\nproperly constituted in the Nigerian judicial system to deal with specific issues and for speedier\ndispensation of justice. The Note Verbale makes other specific points on the conduct of the trial, arguing for\nits fairness: the placement of evidence, its conduct in public, and the fact that some of the defendants were\nultimately acquitted.\n88. In its oral presentation at the 19th Session, the government argued that the confirmation of sentence\ngiven by the state governors is an adequate appeal.\n89. The Commission might cite opposing facts, casting doubt upon the fairness of the tribunal. For\nexample, The Head of State personally chose its members consisting of three instead of the five persons\nrequired by the Civil Disturbances Act. When defence counsel wrote to the Chief Judge of the Federal High\nCourt on 27th November 1994 for information on when the trial would begin, the judge responded, \"This\nCourt has nothing to do about the Tribunal. It is the responsibility of the Presidency\".\n90. There is a great deal of information available from Nigerian and international sources on the day-to-day\nconduct of the tribunal and the significance of its legal rulings. Yet in reaching its decision, the Commission\nneed only rely upon its earlier holding, made in less politically charged circumstances, that the special\n6\n\n\ftribunals established under the Civil Disturbances Act are in violation of the African Charter. As a result, it\nfinds that Ken Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants were denied the right to a fair trial, in violation of Article\n7(1)(d).\n91. Section 7 of the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunals) Decree No. 2 of 1987 decides that the confirming\nauthority of judgments given under the act is the PRC, that is the ruling council of the Federal Military\ngovernment, the members of which are exclusively members of the armed forces.\n92. Section 8(1) of the same Decree stipulates:\nThe validity of any decision, sentence, judgement, confirmation, direction, notice or order given or made, as\nthe case may be, or any other thing whatsoever done under this Act shall not be inquired into by any court\nof law.\n93. In this case, it is not safe to view the Provisional Ruling Council as impartial or independent. Section\n8(1) effectively ousts all possibility of appeal to the ordinary courts. Thus, the accused persons had no\npossibility of appeal to a competent national organ, and the Commission finds a violation of Article 7(1)(a).\n94. Article 26 of the African Charter reads:\nStates parties to the present Charter shall have the duty to guarantee the independence of the Courts... .\n95. As stated above, the Special Tribunal and the Provisional Ruling Council are not independent. The\nCommission also finds that there is a violation of Article 26 of the African Charter.\n96. The government has not contradicted the allegations contained in communication 154/96 that at the\nconviction in October 1995 the Tribunal itself admitted that there was no direct evidence linking the\naccused to the act of the murders, but held that they had each failed to establish that they did not commit\nthe crime alleged. Communication 154/96 has also affirmed that prior to and during the trial, leading\nrepresentatives of the government pronounced MOSOP and the accused guilty of the crimes at various\npress conferences and before the United Nations. As the allegations have not been contradicted, the\nCommission find a violation of the right to be presumed innocent, Article 7(1)(b)\n97. Initially, the accused were defended by a team of lawyers of their own choice. According to\nCommunication 154/96 and Communication 139/94, this team withdrew from the case because of\nharassment, both in the conduct of the trial and in their professional and private lives outside.\nCommunication 154/96 alleges that two of the lawyers were seriously assaulted by soldiers claiming to be\nacting on the instruction of the military officer responsible for the trial. On three occasions defence lawyers\nwere arrested and detained and two of the lawyers had their offices searched. When these lawyers\nwithdrew from the case, the harassment subsided.\n98. After the withdrawal of their chosen counsel, the accused were defended by a team assigned by the\nTribunal. However, this team also resigned, complaining of harassment. After that, the accused declined to\naccept a new team appointed by the Tribunal, and the court proceedings were closed without the accused\nhaving legal representation for the duration.\n99. Communication 154/96 also claims that the defence was denied access to the evidence on which the\nprosecution was based and that files and documents which were required by the accused for their defence\nwere removed from their residences and offices when they were searched by security forces on different\noccasions during the trial.\n100. The government claims that: \"Their [the accused] defence team which comprised sly human rights\nactivists such as Femi Falana and Gani Fawehinmi, known to be more disposed towards melodrama than\nthe actual defence of their clients, inexplicably withdrew from the Special Tribunal at a crucial stage of the\ntrial in order to either play to the gallery or delay and frustrate the process\".\n101. This statement does not contradict the allegations of Communication 154/96, that two different\ndefence teams were harassed into quitting the defence of the accused persons; it merely attributed\nmalicious motives to the defence. The government has not responded to the allegations of withholding\nevidence from the defence. The Commission therefore finds itself with no alternative but to conclude that a\nviolation of Article 7(1)(c) has occurred.\n102. Article 4 of the African Charter reads:\nHuman beings are inviolable. Every human being shall be entitled to respect for his life and the integrity of\nhis person. No one may be arbitrarily deprived of this right.\n103. Given that the trial which ordered the executions itself violates Article 7, any subsequent\nimplementation of sentences renders the resulting deprivation of life arbitrary and in violation of Article 4.\n7\n\n\fThe violation is compounded by the fact that there were pending communications before the African\nCommission at the time of the executions, and the Commission had requested the government to avoid\ncausing any \"irreparable prejudice\" to the subjects of the communications before the Commission had\nconcluded it consideration. Executions had been stayed in Nigeria in the past on the invocation by the\nCommission of its rule on provisional measures (Rule 109 now Rule 111) and the Commission had hoped\nthat a similar situation will obtain in the case of Ken Saro-Wiwa and others. It is a matter of deep regret that\nthis did not happen.\n104. The protection of the right to life in Article 4 also includes a duty for the state not to purposefully let a\nperson die while in its custody. Here at least one of the victims' lives was seriously endangered by the\ndenial of medication during detention. Thus, there are multiple violations of Article 4.\n105. Article 11 of the African Charter provides:\nEvery individual shall have the right to assemble freely with others...\n106. Communication 154/96 alleges that Article 11 was violated because the murder trial directly followed\npublic meetings of MOSOP. In its judgement, the Tribunal held that the condemned persons \"created the\nfire that consumed the four Ogoni chiefs\" by wrongfully organising election campaign rallies and permitting\na large crowd of fanatical MOSOP and NYCOP youths to congregate. It appears that the Tribunal holds the\naccused responsible for the murders because they organised the rally after which the murders took place,\nalthough Ken Saro-Wiwa for one was prevented by government officials from attending the rally. The\nCommission has considerable difficulty with this position as it can adversely affect the right to assembly.\n107. Article 10(1) of the African Charter reads:\nEvery individual shall have the right to free association provided that he abides by the law.\n108. Communication 154/96 alleges that Article 10(1) was violated because the victims were tried and\nconvicted for their opinions, as expressed through their work in MOSOP. In its judgement, the Tribunal held\nthat by their membership in MOSOP, the condemned persons were responsible for the murders, guilt by\nassociation, it would seem furthermore that, government officials at different times during the trial declared\nMOSOP and the accused guilty of the charges, without waiting for the official judgement. This\ndemonstrates a clear prejudice against the organisation MOSOP, which the government has done nothing\nto defend or justify. Therefore the Commission finds a violation of Article 10(1).\n109. Article 9(2) of the African Charter reads:\nEvery individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinions within the law.\n110. There is a close relationship between the rights expressed in the Articles 9(2), 10(1) and 11.\nCommunication 154 alleges that the actual reason for the trial and the ultimate death sentences was the\npeaceful expression of views by the accused persons. The victims were disseminating information and\nopinions on the rights of the people who live in the oil producing area of Ogoniland, through MOSOP and\nspecifically a rally. These allegations have not been contradicted by the government, which has already\nbeen shown to be highly prejudiced against MOSOP, without giving concrete justifications. MOSOP was\nfounded specifically for the expression of views of the people who live in the oil producing areas, and the\nrally was organised with this in view. The Government's actions is inconsistent with Article 9(2) implicit\nwhen it violated Articles 10(1) and 11.\n111. Article 16 of the Charter reads:\n1. Every individual shall have the right to enjoy the best attainable state of physical and mental health.\n2. States parties to the present Charter shall take the necessary measures to protect the health of their\npeople and to ensure that they receive medical attention when they are sick.\n112. The responsibility of the government is heightened in cases where an individual is in its custody and\ntherefore someone whose integrity and well-being is completely dependent on the actions of the\nauthorities. The State has a direct responsibility in this case. Despite requests for hospital treatment made\nby a qualified prison doctor, these were denied to Ken Saro-Wiwa, causing his health to suffer to the point\nwhere his life was endangered. The government has not denied this allegation in any way. This is a\nviolation of Article16.\n113. Nigeria has been a State Party to the African Charter for over a decade, and is thus bound by Article 1\nof the African Charter.\n8\n\n\f114. The Commission assists States parties to implement their obligations under the Charter. Rule 111 of\nthe Commission's Rules of Procedure (revised) aims at preventing irreparable damage being caused to a\ncomplainant before the Commission. Execution in the face of the invocation of Rule 111 defeats the\npurpose of this important rule. The Commission had hoped that the Government of Nigeria would respond\npositively to its request for a stay of execution pending the former's determination of the communication\nbefore it.\n115. This is a blot on the legal system of Nigeria that will not be easy to erase. To have carried out the\nexecution in the face of pleas to the contrary by the Commission and world opinion is something that we\npray will never happen again. That it is a violation of the Charter is an understatement.\n116. The Nigerian Government itself recognises that human rights are no longer solely a matter of domestic\nconcern. The African Charter was drafted and acceded to voluntarily by African States wishing to ensure\nthe respect of human rights on this continent. Once ratified, States Parties to the Charter are legally bound\nto its provisions. A state not wishing to abide by the African Charter might have refrained from ratification.\nOnce legally bound, however, a state must abide by the law in the same way an individual must.\n\nHolding\n\nFor the above reasons, the Commission\n\nDecides that there has been a violation of Articles 5 and 16 in relation to Ken Saro-Wiwa's detention in\n1993 and his treatment in detention in 1994 and 1995;\nDecides that there has been a violation of Article 6 in relation to the detention of all the victims under the\nState Security (Detention of Persons) Act of 1984 and State Security (Detention of Persons) Amended\nDecree No. 14 (1994). The government therefore has the obligation to annul these Decrees;\nReiterates its decision on communication 87/93 that there has been a violation of Article 7(1)(d) and with\nregard to the establishment of the Civil Disturbances Tribunal. In ignoring this decision, Nigeria has\nviolation Article 1 of the Charter;\nDecides that there has been a violation of Article 4 and 7 (1) (a), (b)(c) and (d) in relation to the conduct of\nthe trial and the execution of the victims;\nHolds that there has been a violation of Articles 9(2), 10(1) and 11, 26, 16;\n\nHolds that in ignoring its obligations to institute provisional measures, Nigeria has violated Article 1.\nBanjul, 31st October 1998.\n\n9\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"activity_report":"12th Activity Report: 1998 – 1999","keywords":"Torture and ill treatment, Extrajudicial executions, Arrest and detention, Death penalty, Freedom of expression, Freedom of association, Freedom of assembly, Armed forces, Right to health, Right to fair trial, Independence of the judiciary","date":"October 31, 1998","outcome":"4","country":"36","language":"","mechanism":"2","type_of_document":""},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080a0c35","title":"Hadjali Mohamad  Algeria","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463555924346,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"13_88 Hadjali Mohamad _ Algeria.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463555925413egu2i9bxn1m7vi.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463555925413egu2i9bxn1m7vi.pdf","size":4122},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"13/88 Hadjali Mohamad / Algeria\nCommunication about slow judicial process but no specific breaches of the provisions of the Charter, dated\nAugust 29th 1988.\n1.

This communication is submitted by Africa Legal Aid (AFLA), an NGO, on behalf of a minor, Isaac\nBanda, and his brother, Robert Banda.\n2. The Complainant alleges that the above-mentioned minor is reported to have been fraudulently taken out\nof his country of origin, Malawi, and subjected to working conditions close to slavery in The Gambia by\nsomeone called Collyer, a British national.\n3. According to the Complainant, Mr Collyer proposed to employ the minor, Isaac Banda, as a domestic\nservant while he was residing with his parents in Malawi and undertook to finance his studies in lieu of\nsalary.\n4. Following such an arrangement and with the help of one Nyilenda, Mr Collyer is reported to have\npersuaded the minor, Isaac Banda, together with his parents to agree that the latter follow him to The\nGambia and continue to serve him under the same terms of the above-mentioned arrangement concerning\nhis education.\n5. On their arrival in The Gambia, it is reported that the minor, Isaac Banda, was not allowed access to\neducation. Occasionally, he was reportedly denied food. Furthermore, his employer, in 1995, is reported to\nhave ordered him to immediately leave his house. Thanks to the intervention of the African Centre for\nDemocracy and Human Rights Studies and the Centre for Youths and Children, the minor, Isaac Banda,\nwas repatriated to his country of origin.\n\nComplaint\n6.

The communication was received at the Secretariat of the Commission on 23rd October 1997 by fax. The\noriginal copy arrived later by post.\n8. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the communication on 27th October 1997 and requested the\nComplainant to furnish it with further information.\n9. The communication was ready but could not be considered by the Commission at its 22nd Ordinary\nSession from 2nd to 11th November 1997.\n10. Africa Legal Aid reacted to the request for further information on 30th January 1998 thus:\n•\n• That the minor, Isaac Banda, lived in the house of a man called Collyer in The Gambia at the same\ntime as his brother, Robert Banda, who referred the case to Africa Legal Aid.\n• According to the Complainant, the two brothers who are reported to have returned to their country of\norigin did not have the means to take court action in The Gambia. The Complainant further states\nthat the authorities of that country, having allowed such injustice to take place on their territory\nwithout intervening, allows one to wonder if the local remedies available are efficient and effective.\n11. At its 23rd Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 20th to 29th April 1998, the Commission\ndecided to be seized of the communication, and requested more information on the circumstances\nsurrounding the child's entry into The Gambia and of his treatment while in the country.\n12. On 26th May 1998, the Secretariat sent letters to the Complainant and the State Party concerned\ninforming them of the Commission's decision.\n13. At its 24th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 22nd to 31st October, the Commission\npostponed consideration of the communication to the 25th Ordinary Session.\n14. On 20th January 1999, the Secretariat dispatched letters to the parties notifying them of the decision.\n15. At its 25th Ordinary Session held in Bujumbura, Burundi, the Commission postponed consideration of\nthe communication to the 26th Ordinary Session due to lack of time.\n16. On 13th May 1999, the Secretariat of the Commission notified the parties of this decision.\n17. At its 26th Ordinary Session held in Kigali, Rwanda, the Commission declared the communication\nadmissible and requested for arguments on the merits of the case.\n18. On 21st January 2000, the Secretariat of the Commission informed the parties of the decision.\n19. The matter was also taken up on 10th March 2000, by the Legal Officer at the Secretariat in a meeting\nwith Mrs Tomasi and Mr Almami Taal, State Counsel in the Department of State for Justice, The Gambia,\nconcerning communication 219/98. The State Counsel promised to meet the State Party's obligation as\nrequested.\n20. The Complainant responded to the Commission's request for arguments on the merits of the case on\n12th April 2000.\n21. On 17th April 2000, the Complainant's brief was forwarded to the State Party for its information and\nnecessary action.\n22. At its 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria, the Commission deferred consideration of the case to the\nnext session and requested the respondent state to furnish the Secretariat with its submission on the merits\nof the case.\n23. The above decision was communicated to parties on 10th July 2000. The Secretariat is yet to receive\nthe Respondent State's response.\n24. At its 28th Ordinary Session in Benin, the African Commission reviewed the case and decided to\nre-examine its admissibility at the 29th Ordinary Session. The Commission also decided to examine the\nmerits of the case at the said session.\n25. On 14th November 2000, the Secretariat wrote to the Respondent State informing it the decision taken\nat the 28th Ordinary Session and reminded it to furnish the Commission with arguments on both\nadmissibility and merits of the case and, in particular, on the facts implicating state obligation under the\nAfrican Charter.\n\n2\n\n\f26. On 14th November 2000, the Secretariat also wrote to the complainant informing it of the decision taken\nat the 28th Ordinary Session and requested it to furnish the Commission with more arguments on the merits\nof the case and, in particular, on the facts implicating state obligation under the African Charter.\n27. On 21st March 2001, the Secretariat of the African Commission received submissions from the\nComplainant as earlier requested.\n28. On 3rd April 2001, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainant acknowledging receipt of the said\nsubmissions.\n29. On 17th April 2001, the Secretariat received submissions on admissibility from the Respondent State.\n30. At its 29th Ordinary Session, the Commission heard submissions from the representatives of the\nComplainant and the Respondent State.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n31. In its brief, AFLA claims: \"(The) State authorities were made aware of the Complainant's situation\". The\nfollowing statements apparently support this: \"In doing so they communicated the situation of the\nComplainant to the authorities in The Gambia and in Malawi. The African Centre for Democracy and\nHuman Rights Studies intervened to draw the attention of the Gambian authorities to the circumstances of\nMr Banda, to no avail\". Who these authorities are is not indicated. When the communication was made is\nalso not stated. Those bare assertions of the Complainant that a communication was made to the\nauthorities in The Gambia is insufficient to saddle it with responsibility for the actions of an individual, Mr\nRobert Collyer, mindful of a State's responsibility for non-state actors as was held by the Commission in\ncommunication 74/92 Commission Nationale des Droits de l'Homme des Libertes/Chad.\n32. In their reply, the respondent State denies that they were informed of the human rights abuses suffered\nby Isaac Banda at the hands of Robert Collyer. In their submission, the Respondent State stresses that\nthere are legal avenues provided for within The Gambia that the Complainant should have utilised to obtain\na remedy and that such avenues are not unduly prolonged. The Respondent State argues that failure of the\nComplainant to access these legal avenues render the communication inadmissible for non-exhaustion of\nlocal remedies as required under Article 56(5) of the African Charter.\n33. The case for non-exhaustion of local remedies:\n• The Complainant was a minor\nThe statement of facts in the brief shows how NGOs helped him (see paragraph 5). If he could be\nhelped to return home, he could have been assisted to pursue a remedy in the courts of The\nGambia. The likes of Mr Robert Collyer (as portrayed in the statement of facts), should be made to\nface the full rigours of the law.\n• The Complainant was indigent/was unable to pay legal fees\nThe response to (a) above applies mutatis mutandi\n• The State did not offer any legal assistance to the Complainant\nThere is no convincing evidence that the attention of the State was drawn to the plight of the victim\nof the alleged violation.\n• The Complainant's parents were in another country and were indigent\nThe NGOs could have helped him (as indicated above).\n• The Complainant is now residing in another State\nInstead of using the Commission as a court of first instance, Africa Legal Aid is advised to see what\nremedies are available in The Gambia and to exhaust them before coming to the Commission.\n34. Since Mr Robert Collyer is presumably still in The Gambia, greater help in the protection of human\nrights will be given by ensuring that he does not continue the alleged ill treatment of minors he brings into\nthe country. If he persists, the attention of the Government of The Gambia should be drawn to his conduct,\nand the appropriate steps taken to address the issue\n35. It is not in all cases that residence outside the jurisdiction will not require exhaustion of local remedies,\nas was held in 103/93 Alhassan Abubakar/Ghana. In that case, the Complainant had been detained without\ntrial for years, and he escaped from detention. He also feared that he would lose his liberty if he were to\n3\n\n\freturn to Ghana.\n36. Reliance is also placed on the Commission's decision in 215/98 Rights International/Nigeria. But that\ncase is also distinguishable from the instant case. In that case, the Complainant alleged that Mr Charles\nBandiorn Wiwa, a Nigerian student, was arrested and tortured at a Nigerian military detention camp. He\nwas horsewhipped and placed in a cell with 40 other detainees. The Complainant claimed that the victim's\ntorture resulted from his identification as a relative of Ken Saro-Wiwa, who had been executed in defiance\nof the Commission's request for a stay of execution under its provisional measures procedure in Rule 111\nof the Rules of Procedure.\n37. Having fled Nigeria in fear for his life and on the advice of human rights lawyers, and having obtained\nasylum from the government of the United States of America, the Commission did not consider the\nexhaustion of local remedies arose in the circumstances. The Commission in that case stated: \"In this\nparticular case, the Commission found that Mr Wiwa was unable to pursue any domestic remedy following\nhis flight for fear of his life to the Republic of Benin and the subsequent granting of refugee status to him by\nthe United States of America.\" Significantly, the Commission also stated categorically in paragraph 23 of\ncommunication 215/98, Rights International/Nigeria as follows:\n\"The Commission declared the communication admissible on grounds that there was lack of available and\neffective remedies for human rights violations in Nigeria under the military regimes\".\nThe same could not be said of a minor needing the protection of the State, as was the situation in the\ninstant case.\n38. The Commission should not, therefore, be taken to have laid down a hard and fast rule that whenever a\nComplainant finds himself outside the jurisdiction, the inescapable conclusion should be that the\nrequirement of exhaustion of local remedies mandated under Article 56(5) does not apply.\n\nHolding\n\nFor these reasons, the Commission\nAfter reconsidering its decision on admissibility as taken at its 26th Ordinary Session in Kigali, Rwanda,\n\nDeclares the communication inadmissible for non-exhaustion of local remedies, having ascertained that\nthe Complainant neither resorted to local remedies, nor did he bring the alleged violations to the attention of\nthe Respondent State.\n\nTripoli, Libya, 23rd April to 7th May 2001.\n\n4\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"activity_report":"14th Activity Report : 2000 – 2001","keywords":"Liberty of the person, Refugee rights, Right to food, Right to education","date":"May 7, 2001","outcome":"19","country":"19","language":"","mechanism":"","type_of_document":""},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080accbe","title":"Interights (on behalf of Jose Domingos Sikunda)","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559106434,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"239_01 Interights (on behalf of Jose Domingos Sikunda) _ Namibia.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463559107415330ozscy157mn29.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463559107415330ozscy157mn29.pdf","size":12710},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"239/01 Interights (on behalf of Jose Domingos\nSikunda) / Namibia\nSummary of Facts\n1. The communication is submitted by INTERIGHTS (the Complainant), a human rights NGO based in the\nUnited Kingdom, on behalf of Jose Domingos Sikunda.\n2. Mr Sikunda is of Angolan descent but has been living in Namibia for 25 years.\n3. The Complainant alleges that sometime in 2000, Mr Sikunda was arrested and detained by Namibian\nauthorities. No reasons were given for his arrest and detention.\n4. It is alleged that on 24th October 2000 the [H]igh [C]ourt of Namibia ordered the release of Mr Sikunda\nfrom detention but that the government of Namibia declined to comply with the order.\n5. It is also alleged that Mr Sikunda's lawyers then sought to enforce the High Court order and on 31st\nOctober the Judge issued a rule nisi directing the Minister to show cause why he should not be cited for\ncontempt of the court order. The case was adjourned twice and on 12th January 2001 Judge Teek delivered\nhis ruling recusing himself from the case without either party having applied for it.\n6. The Complainant states that there is a pending court order restraining the deportation of Mr Sikunda\nwhich will lapse on 1st February 2001; and that the Namibian authorities have indicated their preparedness\nto deport Mr Sikunda to Angola whose government accuses Mr Sikunda of being a UNITA rebel. The\nComplainant alleges that such an act will put Mr Sikunda at real risk of torture and extra-judicial death.\n\nComplaint\n7. The Complainant alleges a violation of Articles 4, 5 and 12 (4) of the African Charter.\n\nProcedure\n8. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the [African] Commission on 31st January 2001\nby fax, a copy of which was forwarded to the Chairman of the African Commission requesting him to appeal\n(under Rule 111 of the [African] Commission's Rules of Procedure) to the Namibian government to refrain\nfrom taking any measures that may put the life of Mr Sikunda at risk.\n9. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the communication on 2nd February 2001 and requested the\nComplainant to furnish it with further information.\n10. On 19th February 2001, the Chairman of the African Commission wrote to the Minister of Foreign Affairs\nof the Republic of Namibia expressing concern over the alleged deportation of Mr Sikunda.\n11. On 22nd February 2001, the government of Namibia responded to the Chairman's appeal declining it\nand stating that the actions of the Namibian government were legal and aimed at protecting the security of\nthe country and its citizens.\n12. On 12th March 2001 a copy of the above-mentioned written response was forwarded to the\nComplainant and they were reminded to furnish the [African] Commission with further information.\n13. On 21st March 2001, the Complainant responded to the request for further information stating that will\nrevert back to the [African] Commission with additional submissions and evidentiary material.\n14. At its 29th Ordinary Session, the [African] Commission decided to be seized of the complaint.\n15. On 23rd May 2001, the Secretariat conveyed the above decision to the parties and requested parties to\nfurnish it with additional information on admissibility in accordance with Article 56 of the African Charter and\nforwarded a copy of the text of the complaint to the Respondent State. The parties were requested to\npresent their written submissions to the Secretariat within three months of notification of the decision.\n16. During his promotional visit to Namibia from 2nd to 7th July 2001, Commissioner Chigovera raised the\nmatter of this complaint with officials from the Ministries of Justice and Foreign Affairs and urged them to\nsubmit their written submissions to the Secretariat as soon as possible.\n17. On 17th August 2001, the Parties were reminded to forward their written submissions to the Secretariat\non or before the 23rd of August 2001.\n18. On 18th and 21st September 2001, the Secretariat wrote to the Respondent State and the Complainant\nrespectively reminding them to forward their submissions on admissibility.\n1\n\n\f19. On 24th September 2001, the Secretariat received a letter from INTERIGHTS stating that they would\nnot be able to forward their submissions for consideration at the forthcoming 30th Session as there are\nelements missing from their submissions that have not been transmitted by the lawyers of the victims.\n20. At its 30th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the Commission considered the\ncommunication and decided to defer the matter to the 31st Ordinary Session to allow the Complainants\nforward their submissions on admissibility.\n21. On 9th November 2001, the parties were informed of the [African] Commission???s decision.\n22. On 2nd January 2002, the Complainants were reminded to submit their written submissions on\nadmissibility.\n23. By email on 7th January 2002, the Complainants informed the Secretariat that they had sent a request\nfor supplementary information to their colleagues in Namibia but had not yet heard from them and in the\nevent that they do not hear from them they would actively consider sending a notification for discontinuance\nof the case.\n24. On 19th March 2002, the Secretariat wrote enquiring as to whether the Complainants still wished to\nproceed with the communication and if that were the case to forward their written submissions on\nadmissibility.\n25. The Complainant on 20th March 2002 wrote informing the Secretariat that despite repeated attempts\nthey had failed to secure a response from their colleagues at the National Society for Human Rights. The\nComplainants assured the Secretariat that if this situation does not change before the next session, then\nthey would request the [African] Commission to authorise them to withdraw the communication.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n26. Article 56 of the African Charter governs admissibility. The most relevant provisions of that Article\nprovide communications ... received by the Commission shall be considered if they: \"(5)... are sent after\nexhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged\".\n27. The Respondent State argues that following refusal by the Minister of Home Affairs to honour the High\nCourt decision on 24th October 2000 ordering Sikunda's release from detention, Sikunda's lawyers sought\nto enforce the court order by an application to commit the Minister of Home Affairs for contempt of court.\n28. The Respondent State submits that INTERIGHTS submitted the present communication to the African\nCommission on 31st January 2001 whilst the matter of hearing the application of a rule nisi showing cause\nwhy the Home Affairs Minister should not be held in contempt of court was still pending before the High\nCourt. Indeed, [the] High Court heard the matter on 1st February 2001 and delivered judgement on 9th\nFebruary 2001, finding the Minister of Home Affairs in contempt of court. Therefore, the Respondent State\nargues, that INTERIGHTS by submitting a complaint on 31st January 2001 had failed to meet the\nrequirements of Article 56(5) of the African Charter.\n29. The Complainants on the other hand have been repeatedly requested by the [African] Commission to\nfurnish their submissions on admissibility, especially on the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies\nbut there has not been any response from them.\n30. Thus, from the information available to the [African] Commission and principally from the copy of the\njudgement of the High Court of Namibia delivered on 9th February 2001; the [African] Commission observes\nthat the Complainant brought the matter before it prior to exhausting domestic remedies, indeed while the\nmatter was still pending before the High Court of Namibia.\n\nHolding\n\nFor these reasons, the [African] Commission in conformity with Article 56(5) of the African Charter\ndeclares this communication inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.\n\nNOTE:\n2\n\n\fWhen the Chair of the [African] Commission wrote to the Government of Namibia expressing concern over\nthe alleged deportation of Mr Sikunda, the government responded stating that its actions were legal and\naimed at protecting the security of the country and its citizens.\nFollowing the decision that the [African] Commission has come to, the [African] Commission would like to\nstate that in circumstances where an alleged violation is brought to the attention of the [African]\nCommission and where it is alleged that irreparable damage may be caused to the victim, the [African]\nCommission will act expeditiously appealing to the Responding State to desist from taking any action that\nmay cause irreparable damage until after the [African] Commission has had the opportunity to examine the\nmatter fully. In such cases the [African] Commission acts on the facts as presented and it was therefore in\nthis vein that the [African] Commission wrote to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia\nexpressing concern over the alleged deportation of Mr Sikunda.\n\nDone at the 31stOrdinary session of the African Commission held in Pretoria, South Africa, from\n2ndto 16th May 2002.\n\n3\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"34","date":"May 16, 2002","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"Torture and ill treatment, Arrest and detention, Freedom of movement","activity_report":"15th Activity Report : 2001 - 2002","outcome":"19"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080ad84f","title":"Liesbeth Zegveld and Mussie Ephrem","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559106435,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"250_02 Liesbeth Zegveld and Mussie Ephrem _ Eritrea.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463559107338pe3mp349bai3sor.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463559107338pe3mp349bai3sor.pdf","size":37260},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"250/02 Liesbeth Zegveld and Mussie Ephrem / Eritrea\nSummary of Facts\n1. The complaint is filed by Dr Liesbeth Zegveld, an international lawyer at a Netherlands based firm Böhler\nFranken Koppe De Feijter, and Mr Mussie Ephrem, an Eritean living in Sweden.\n2. The complainants allege that eleven (11) former Eritrean government officials, namely, Petros Solomon,\nOgbe Abraha, Haile Woldetensae, Mahmud Ahmed Sheriffo, Berhane Ghebre Eghzabiher, Astier\nFeshation, Saleh Kekya, Hamid Himid, Estifanos Seyoum, Germano Nati and Beraki Ghebre Selassie were\nillegally arrested in Asmara, Eritrea on 18th and 19th September 2001 in violation of Eritrean laws and the\nAfrican Charter. They were part of a group of fifteen (15) senior officials of the ruling Peoples' Front for\nDemocracy and Justice (PFDJ) who had been openly critical of the Eritrean Government policies. In May\n2001, they wrote an open letter to ruling party members criticising the government for acting in an 'illegal\nand unconstitutional' manner. Their letter also called upon \"all PFDJ members and Eritrean people in\ngeneral to express their opinion through legal and democratic means and to give their support to the goals\nand principles they consider just\". The government subsequently announced that the eleven individuals\nmentioned above, on whose behalf the present complaint is being filed, had been detained 'because of\ncrimes against the nation's security and sovereignty.\n3. The complaint also alleges that the detainees could be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the\npeaceful expression of their political opinions. Their whereabouts is currently unknown. The Complainants\nallege that the detainees may be held in some management building between the capital Asmara and the\nport of Massawa. They have reportedly not been given access to their families or lawyers. The\nComplainants fear for the safety of the detainees.\n4. The Complainants state that they have made a request for habeas corpus to the Minister of Justice of\nEritrea. They claim that they could not submit the same to the courts, as the place of detention of the 11\nformer officials was unknown. They allege that in the habeas corpus the Eritrean authorities were asked,\namong others, to reveal where the 11 detainees were being held, to either charge and bring them to court\nor promptly release them, to guarantee that none of them would be ill treated and that they have immediate\naccess to lawyers of their choice, their families and adequate medical care. The Complainants allege that\nno reaction has been received from the Eritrean authorities.\n5. Together with their complaint the Complainants submitted a request for provisional measures to the\nAfrican Commission in accordance with Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\n\nComplaint\n6. The Complainants allege violations of Articles 2, 6, 7(1) and 9(2) of the African Charter.\n7. The Complainants pray that should the detainees be tried, the trial should be held in accordance with\ninternational human rights standards and without recourse to the death penalty. They claim that such a trial\nshould not be before the Special Court, which they allege fails to meet international standards of fair trial.\n\nProcedure\n8. The complaint was dated 9th April 2002 and received at the Secretariat on 9th April 2002 by fax, and on\n9th and 11th April 2002 by email.\n9. On 19th April 2002, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainants acknowledging receipt of the complaint,\nand informing them that their request for provisional measures was noted and would be acted upon\naccordingly.\n10. On 3rd May 2002, the African Commission wrote a letter of appeal to His Excellency Issayas Afewerki,\nPresident of the State of Eritrea, respectfully urging him to intervene in the matter being complained of\npending the outcome of the consideration of the complaint before the [African] Commission.\n11. At its 31st Ordinary Session held from 2nd to 16th May 2002 in Pretoria, South Africa, the African\nCommission considered the complaint and decided to be seized thereof.\n12. On 20th May 2002, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State of Eritrea responded to the [African]\nCommission appeal and confirming to the latter that the alleged victims on whose behalf the complaint was\nfiled had their quarters in appropriate government facilities, had not been ill-treated, have had continued\n1\n\n\faccess to medical services and that the government was making every effort to bring them before an\nappropriate court of law as early as possible.\n13. On 28th May 2002, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainants and the Respondent State of the [African]\nCommission's decision to be seized of the matter and requested them to forward their submissions on\nadmissibility before the 32nd Ordinary Session of the [African] Commission.\n14. The Secretariat of the African Commission forwarded the Ministry's response to the Chairperson of the\nAfrican Commission on 7th June 2002 and to the Complainants on 18th June 2002.\n15. On 25th October 2002, the African Commission wrote, by way of follow up on its urgent appeal in the\nmatter, to the Respondent State reminding it that it was the responsibility of the Member State's General\nProsecutor to bring the accused before a competent court of law in accordance with the rules guaranteeing\nfair trial under relevant national and international instruments.\n16. The two parties made submissions on admissibility.\n17. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th May 2003, in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\nheard oral submissions from both parties to the communication and decided to declare the communication\nadmissible.\n18. On 10th June 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote informing the parties to the\ncommunication of the African Commission's decision and requested them to forward their submissions on\nthe merits of the communication within 3 months.\n19. The Chairperson of the African Commission forwarded a letter dated 10th June 2003 appealing to His\nExcellency the President of Eritrea to intervene in this matter and urge the authorities holding the 11\nindividuals to release them or bring them before the courts in Eritrea.\n20. At its 34th Ordinary Session, held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission considered the communication and delivered its decision on the merits.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n21. The admissibility of communications brought pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter is governed\nby the conditions stipulated in Article 56 of the African Charter. This article lays down seven (7) conditions,\nwhich must generally be fulfilled by a Complainant for a communication to be declared admissible.\n22. At issue in the present communication is whether the complainants have pursued and exhausted the\ndomestic legal remedies of Eritrea, and if not, whether the exception to the exhaustion of domestic\nremedies rule should apply. This issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies is governed by Article 56(5) of\nthe African Charter and it provides:\n\"Communications ... received by the Commission shall be considered if they are sent after exhausting local\nremedies, if any unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged.\"\n23. The rule requiring exhaustion of local remedies has been applied by international adjudicating bodies\nand is premised on the principle that the Respondent State must first have an opportunity to redress by its\nown means within the framework of its own domestic legal system, the wrong alleged to have been done to\nthe individual.\n24. In determining whether this communication should be declared admissible or otherwise, the African\nCommission must have regard to the arguments put forward by the Complainants and the Respondent\nState.\n25. The Complainants submit they have attempted to exhaust local remedies in Eritrea. They state that on\n26th November 2001 and on 9th April 2002, they submitted a habeas corpus request through the Eritrean\nMinister of Justice asking the Eritrean Authorities to disclose where the 11 detainees were being held and\nwhy. The complainants also requested that the detainees be brought to court and charged in accordance\nwith the law, however, there was no response to their request. A similar request was made on 26th June\n2002 (which is after the African Commission was seized of their complaint) to the Eritrean High Court in\nAsmara to which there was no reply either.\n26. In her oral submissions during the 33rd Ordinary Session of the African Commission, Zegveld stated\nthat in an attempt to access the local courts, they had requested locally based legal practitioners (whom\nshe declined to name) to bring the matter before the local courts. However, the said lawyers later informed\nher that they would not be able to pursue the detainees' case in the domestic courts for fear of persecution\n2\n\n\fby the authorities and for fear of jeopardising their legal practice.\n27. The Complainants further submit that for more than 18 months, the 11 detainees have been held in\ndetention without formal charges and with no access to their lawyers or families thus rendering them unable\nto seek legal or administrative redress. Furthermore, there has been no response from the government of\nEritrea or High Court of Asmara, in relation to the Complainants' requests of 26th November 2001 and 9th\nApril 2002.\n28. Under the circumstances presented above, the Complainants aver that the requirement to exhaust local\nremedies can no longer apply because even where such remedies would have been existent they have\nbeen unduly prolonged in this case.\n29. The Complainants refer the African Commission to a decision of the European Court of Human Rights\nin Ocalan v. Turkey1 where the court held that Ocalan's isolation and the fact that the Turkish police\nobstructed his access to lawyers made it impossible for the applicant to have effective recourse to a\ndomestic remedy under Turkish Law.\n30. In its written submissions, the Respondent State argues that the Complainants addressed their habeas\ncorpus request to the Minister of Justice who is a member of the Executive branch with no capacity to\naddress and take decisions on this matter either in substance or in procedure. They submit that only the\njudiciary has the authority to take action on any civil, criminal and other issues of judicial nature including,\nthe matter of habeas corpus.\n31. During the 33rd Ordinary Session, the Representative of the Respondent State submitted that to date\nthe complainants have not submitted themselves to the courts in Eritrea. He informed the African\nCommission that he had personally checked with the High Court of Asmara to establish whether the matter\nhad been brought to the court's attention but there was no case file on this matter.\n32. The Representative of the Respondent State argues that the Complainants' assertion that they have\nnot been able to access the domestic courts is speculative. He stated that Zegveld should accredit herself\nto the courts in Eritrea to enable her bring this matter before the local courts.\n33. The Respondent State further submits that they have been unable to bring the 11 detainees before a\ncourt of law because of the nature of the criminal justice system in Eritrea. The Representative of the\nRespondent State informed the African Commission that the criminal justice system in Eritrea was inherited\nfrom Ethiopia and is therefore lacking. Within the High Court of Asmara, there is only one chamber\nresponsible for handling criminal cases including criminal matters from the lower courts. As such, the\nCourt's calendar is highly congested and difficult to manage. Therefore cases are bound to take time before\nthey are heard by the courts and this is the very reason for the delay in bringing the matter of the 11\ndetainees before a court of law.\n34. There are exceptions to the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies and the Complainants have\nargued that they could not exhaust the domestic remedies because the domestic legislation of Eritrea does\nnot afford due process of law for the protection of the rights that have allegedly been violated.\n35. At this stage, it should be made clear that, when a person is being held in detention and accused for\ncommitting a crime, the African Commission holds that it is the responsibility of the Member State, through\nits appropriate judicial bodies, to bring this person promptly before a competent court of law in order to\nenable him/her to be tried in accordance with rules guaranteeing the right to a fair trial in accordance with\nnational and international standards.\n36. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the Velasquez case2 while interpreting Article 46\n× Article 46 1. Admission by the Commission of a petition or communication lodged in accordance with\nArticles 44 or 45 shall be subject to the following requirements:\na. That the remedies under domestic law have been pursued and exhausted in accordance with generally\nrecognised principles of international law; b. That the petition or communication is lodged within a period of\nsix months from the date on which the party alleging violation of his rights was notified of the final judgment;\nc. That the subject of the petition or communication is not pending in another international proceeding for\nsettlement; and d. That, in the case of Article 44, the petition contains the name, nationality, profession,\ndomicile, and signature of the person or persons or of the legal representative of the entity lodging the\npetition.\n2. The provisions of paragraphs 1.a and 1.b of this article shall not be applicable when:\na. The domestic legislation of the state concerned does not afford due process of law for the protection of\n3\n\n\fthe right or rights that have allegedly been violated; b. The party alleging violation of his rights has been\ndenied access to the remedies under domestic law or has been prevented from exhausting them; or c.\nThere has been unwarranted delay in rendering a final judgment under the aforementioned remedies.\nhttp://www.hrcr.org/docs/American_Convention/oashr8.html accessed 19.10.2010\nof the American Convention (similar to Article 56(5) of the African Charter) which relates to the issue of\nexhaustion of domestic remedies, stated that, for the rule of prior exhaustion of domestic remedies to be\napplicable, the domestic remedies of the State concerned must be available, adequate and effective in\norder to be exhausted. The Court also opined that where a party raises non-exhaustion of local remedies\nbecause of the unavailability of due process in the State, the burden of proof will shift to \"the State claiming\nnon-exhaustion and it has an obligation to prove that domestic remedies remain to be exhausted and that\nthey are effective\" .\n37. In consolidated communication 147/95 and 149/963 , the African Commission also ruled that domestic\nremedies must be available, effective and sufficient; a domestic remedy is considered available if the\npetitioner can pursue it without impediment, it is effective if it offers a prospect of success and it is sufficient\nif it is capable of redressing the complaint.\n38. The African Commission notes that by its own admission, the Respondent State has indicated that it\nhas not yet put in place structures that would ensure that cases are handled 'within reasonable time'.\nHowever, the Respondent State goes ahead to assure the African Commission that the detainees will be\nbrought before a court of competent jurisdiction in due course.\n39. The State has a constitutional or statutory requirement to provide an accessible, effective and possible\nremedy whereby alleged victims can seek recognition and restoration of their rights before resorting to the\ninternational system for protection of human rights. Such procedures should not be mere formalities that,\nrather than enable the realisation of those rights, to the contrary, dilute with time any possibility of success\nwith respect to their assertion, recognition or exercise.\n40. Very clearly, the situation as presented by the Respondent State does not afford due process of law for\nprotection of the rights that have been alleged to be violated; the detainees have been denied access to the\nremedies under domestic law and have thus been prevented from exhausting them. Furthermore, there has\nbeen unwarranted delay in bringing these detainees to justice.\n41. For these reasons, the African Commission declares this communication admissible.\n\nRuling by the African Commission on request by the Respondent State to revisit the decision on admissibility\n\n42. The present communication was declared admissible at the 33rd Ordinary Session of the African\nCommission's held in May 2003. In response to the African Commission's request for written submissions\non the merits, the Respondent State in a Note Verbale expressed its dismay at the African Commission's\ndecision to declare the matter admissible. They stated that they found the African Commission's decision\non admissibility unacceptable and therefore requested that the African Commission revisits its decision on\nadmissibility.\n43. Before dealing with the merits of the communication, the African Commission would like to pronounce\nitself on the request by the Respondent State to revisit its decision on admissibility.\n44. Firstly, it should be noted that the Respondent State did not bring any new element, either on the facts\nof the case as considered by the African Commission or on the legal grounds upon which [it] is making\nsuch a request.\n45. Secondly, Rule 118(2) of the African Commission's Rules of Procedure stipulate that: \"If the\nCommission has declared a communication inadmissible under the Charter, it may reconsider this decision\nat a later date if it receives a request for reconsideration....\"\nThe Rules of Procedure do not make provision for the African Commission to revisit its decision once a\ncommunication has been declared admissible. Furthermore, it has been the practice of the African\nCommission not to reconsider a decision declaring a communication admissible.\n\nFor these reasons the African Commission upholds its decision on admissibility in this matter.\n\n4\n\n\fMerits\n46. The African Commission delivered its decision on admissibility of this communication at its 33rd\nOrdinary Session and informed the parties of its decision on 10th June 2003. The Secretariat of the African\nCommission further requested the parties to forward their submissions on the merits of the communication\nwithin 3 months. Whereas the Complainants forwarded their written submissions on the merits of the\ncommunication, none were received from the Respondent State. It is an established principle of the African\nCommission that where allegations of violations of provisions of the African Charter go uncontested by the\nGovernment concerned, the African Commission must decide on the facts as given. This principle also\nconforms to the practice of other international human rights adjudicatory bodies. In the present\ncommunication therefore, the African Commission is left with no alternative but to proceed and deliver a\ndecision on the merits based on the submissions of the Complainants. 4 Although the African Commission\nhas in this decision referred to the oral submissions made by the Respondent State during the 33rd\nOrdinary Session, especially as they relate to some issues that touch upon the merits of the\ncommunication, the Respondent State's failure to present comprehensive submissions on the merits has\nbeen done at its own peril.\n47. By Note Verbale dated 20th May 2002, the Respondent State informed the African Commission that the\n11 persons had indeed been detained for \"conspiring to overthrow the legal government of the country in\nviolation of relevant OAU resolutions, colluding with hostile foreign powers with a view to compromising the\nsovereignty of the country, undermining Eritrean national security and endangering Eritrean society and the\ngeneral welfare of its people\". The Respondent State further stated that such detention was in conformity\nwith the criminal code of the country. In their oral submissions made during the 33rd Ordinary Session in\nMay 2003, the Respondent State further admitted that they had not at the time brought the 11 detainees\nbefore any court of law.\n48. The Complainants aver that the 11 persons who were former Eritrean Government officials, had been\nopenly critical of the Eritrean government policies and as a direct result of their open letter criticising the\ngovernment of Eritrea for acting in an illegal and unconstitutional manner, they were arrested and detained\nfor committing \"crimes against the nation's security and sovereignty\".\n49. The Complainants state that the 11 detainees have since September 2001 been held incommunicado\nand have never been brought before any courts of law in violation of Article 17(4)\n× Every person who is held in detention shall be brought before a court of law within forty-eight (48) hours\nof his arrest, and if this is not reasonably possible, as soon as possible thereafter, and no such person shall\nbe held in custody beyond such period without the authority of the court.\n(http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3dd8aa904.html accessed 19.10.2010)\nof the Constitution of the State of Eritrea and Article 6 of the African Charter. Article 17(4) of the\nConstitution provides that every person who is held in detention must be brought before a court of law\nwithin 48 hours of his arrest and no person shall be held in custody beyond such a period without the\nauthority of the court.\n50. The Complainants submit that the above-mentioned acts by the Respondent State violate Articles 2, 6\nand 7(1) of the African Charter.\n51. Article 2 of the African Charter provides: \"Every individual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights\nand freedoms recognised and guaranteed in the present Charter without distinction of any kind such as\nrace, ethnic group, colour, sex, language, religion, or any other opinion, national or social origin, fortune,\nbirth or other status.\" Article 6 of the African Charter provides: \"Every individual shall have the right to\nliberty and to the security of his person. No one may be deprived of his freedom except for reasons and\nconditions previously laid down by law. In particular, no one may be arbitrarily arrested or detained.\" Article\n7(1) of the African Charter provides: \"1. Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This\ncomprises [a] The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts of violating his fundamental\nrights as recognised and guaranteed by conventions, laws, regulations and customs in force; [b] The right\nto be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court or tribunal; [c] The right to defence,\nincluding the right to be defended by counsel of his choice; [d] The right to be tried within a reasonable time\nby an impartial court or tribunal;\"\n52. Although Article 6 of the African Charter guarantees the right to liberty and security of the person, this is\nnot an absolute right because the African Charter allows the deprivation of this right through lawful means.\nThe African Charter specifically prohibits arbitrary arrests and detention.\n\n5\n\n\f53. Evidence before the African Commission indicates that the 11 persons have been held incommunicado\nand without charge since they were arrested in September 2001. This fact has not been contested by the\nRespondent State. They are being held in custody and have been cut off from communication with the\noutside world, with no access to their lawyers or families. Their whereabouts are unknown putting their fate\nunder the exclusive control of the Respondent State.\n54. The African Commission on two occasions wrote letters of appeal to the President of the State of\nEritrea informing him about the communication before the African Commission and requested him to\nintervene in the matter to ensure that the 11 persons are removed from secret detention and brought before\nthe courts of law in Eritrea. In a Note Verbale dated 20th May 2002, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the\nState of Eritrea informed the African Commission that the 11 persons were being held in appropriate\ngovernment facilities, that they had not been ill-treated and had access to medical services. The Ministry\nassured the African Commission that the government was making every effort to bring them before an\nappropriate court of law as early as possible. The African Commission notes that to date it has not received\nany information or substantiation from the Respondent State demonstrating that the 11 persons were being\nheld in appropriate detention facilities and that they had been produced before courts of law.\n55. Incommunicado detention is a gross human rights violation that can lead to other violations such as\ntorture or ill-treatment or interrogation without due process safeguards. Of itself, prolonged incommunicado\ndetention and/or solitary confinement could be held to be a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment\nand treatment. The African Commission is of the view that all detentions must be subject to basic human\nrights standards. There should be no secret detentions and States must disclose the fact that someone is\nbeing detained as well as the place of detention. Furthermore, every detained person must have prompt\naccess to a lawyer and to their families and their rights with regards to physical and mental health must be\nprotected as well as entitlement to proper conditions of detention.5\n56. The African Commission holds the view that the lawfulness and necessity of holding someone in\ncustody must be determined by a court or other appropriate judicial authority. The decision to keep a\nperson in detention should be open to review periodically so that the grounds justifying the detention can be\nassessed. In any event, detention should not continue beyond the period for which the State can provide\nappropriate justification. Therefore, persons suspected of committing any crime must be promptly charged\nwith legitimate criminal offences and the State should initiate legal proceedings that should comply with fair\ntrial standards as stipulated by the African Commission in its Resolution on the Right to Recourse and Fair\nTrial 6 and elaborated upon in its Guidelines on the Right to Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa7\n57. In the present communication, the Respondent State did not provide the African Commission with any\ndetails regarding the specific laws under which the 11 persons were detained but instead generally states\nthat their detention is in \"consonance with the existing criminal code ...and other relevant national and\ninternational instruments\". The 11 persons were detained on account of their political beliefs and are being\nheld in secret detention without any access to the courts, lawyers or family. Regrettably, these persons'\nrights are continually being violated even today, as the Respondent State is still holding them in secret\ndetention in blatant violation of their rights to liberty and recourse to fair trial 8\n58. The Complainants further allege that the 11 persons were arrested and detained because they\nexpressed opinions that were critical of the Respondent State. The Complainants submit that this amounts\nto a violation of Article 9(2) of the African Charter, which provides \"every individual shall have the right to\nexpress and disseminate his opinions within the law\" .\n59. The right to freedom of expression has been recognised by the African Commission as a fundamental\nindividual human right which is also a cornerstone of democracy and a means of ensuring the respect for\nall human rights and freedoms.9 Nonetheless, this right carries with it certain duties and responsibilities and\nit is for this reason that certain restrictions on freedom of expression are allowed. However, Article 9(2) as\nwell as Principle II (2)\n× Any restrictions on freedom of expression shall be provided by law, serve a legitimate interest and be\nnecessary and in a democratic society.\nof the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa categorically state that such restrictions\nhave to be provided for by law.10\n60. It is a well settled principle of the African Commission that any laws restricting freedom of expression\nmust conform to international human rights norms and standards relating to freedom of expression11 and\nshould not jeopardise the right itself. In fact, the African Charter in contrast to other international human\nrights does not permit derogation from this or any other right on the basis of emergencies or special\ncircumstances.\n6\n\n\f61. Consequently, if any person expresses or disseminates opinions that are contrary to laws that meet the\naforementioned criteria, there should be due process and all affected persons should be allowed to seek\nredress in a court of law.12\n62. The facts as presented leave no doubt in the mind of the African Commission that the Respondent\nState did indeed restrict the 11 persons' right to free expression. No charges have been brought against the\n11 persons and neither have they been brought before the courts. Such restrictions not only violate the\nprovisions of the African Charter but are also not in conformity with international human rights standards\nand norms.\n\nHolding\nFor the above reasons, the African Commission,\nFinds the State of Eritrea in violation of Articles 2, 6, 7(1) and 9(2) of the African Charter;\nUrges the State of Eritrea to order the immediate release of the 11 detainees, namely, Petros Solomon,\nOgbe Abraha, Haile Woldetensae, Mahmud Ahmed Sheriffo, Berhane Ghebre Eghzabiher, Astier\nFeshation, Saleh Kekya, Hamid Himid, Estifanos Seyoum, Germano Nati, and Beraki Ghebre Selassie; and\nRecommends that the State of Eritrea compensates the above-mentioned persons.\nDone at the 34th Ordinary Session of the African Commission held from 6th to 20th November 2003,\nin Banjul, The Gambia.\n\nFootnotes\n1 Application No. 46221/99, 12th March 2003.\n2 Velasquez Rodríguez Case, Judgement of July 29 1988, Inter-Am.Ct.H.R (Ser.C) No.4 (1988).\n3 Consolidated communication 147/95 and 149/96 Sir Dawda K.

The Complainant alleges that on the eve of the demonstration by the refugees of Podor in\ncommemoration of the International Refugee Day, the Prefect of the town of Podor banned the said\ndemonstration.\n2. The Complainant does not show whether he had complied with the necessary procedures to obtain\nauthorisation for the demonstration. He however points out that he had sent the programme of the\ndemonstration to the following institutions and persons: African Commission; UN High Commissioner for\nRefugees; Commission for Assistance to Returnees and Displaced Persons; Governor of Saint-Louis;\nPrefect of Podor; Deputy Prefect of Thille Boubacar and the press.\n3. The text of the decision of the Prefect of Podor banning the demonstration which was scheduled to take\nplace on Thursday 20th and Friday 21st June 2002 in the towns of Madina Moussa, Diolly, Podor and\nNgaolé was dated 19th June 2002, citing the need to keep law and order as the reason for this action.\n4. The submission of the Complainant includes the programme of the demonstration sent to the above\nmentioned institutions and persons, the decision of the Prefect of Podor dated 19th June 2002 banning the\ndemonstration scheduled to take place on Thursday 20th and Friday 21st June 2002 in towns of Madina\nMoussa, Diolly, Podor and Ngaolé.\n\nComplaint\n5. The Complainant alleges that Senegal violated Articles 5, 9 and 11 of the African Charter.\n\nProcedure\n6. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 6th August 2002.\n7. On 12th August 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the\ncommunication and informed the Complainant that the complaint was registered and would be considered\nat the 32nd Ordinary Session scheduled to take place in Banjul, The Gambia, from 17th to 31st October\n2002.\n8. At the 32nd Ordinary Session held from 17th to 23rd October 2002 in Banjul, The Gambia, after\nconsidering the communication, the African Commission decided to be seized with the said communication.\n9. On 30th October 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties of the\nabove-mentioned decision and asked them to provide it with more information on the admissibility of the\ncommunication, in accordance with Article 56 of the African Charter. It also sent a copy of the\ncommunication to the Respondent State. It requested the parties to send their written observations to the\nSecretariat within two months after notification of the decision.\n10. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th May 2003 in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\nconsidered this communication and declared it inadmissible.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n11. The admissibility of the communications submitted under Article 55 of the African Charter is governed\nby the conditions set out in Article 56 of the African Charter. The applicable provision in this particular case\nis that of Article 56(5) which stipulates that: \"communications....shall be considered if they: (5)...are sent\nafter exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged...\".\n12. In the case under consideration, the Complainant alleges that on the eve of the demonstration for the\ncommemoration of the International Refugee Day, the Prefect of the town of Podor issued a ban of the\n1\n\n\fdemonstration by Mauritanian refugees.\n13. The Complainant filed the decision of the Prefect of Podor banning the demonstration scheduled to take\nplace on 20th and 21st June 2002 in the towns of Madina Moussa, Diolly, Podor and Ngaolé.\n14. In the Complainant's written observations, it is alleged that according to the information received, the\nprocedure applied in such a case by Conseil d'Etat would be unduly prolonged, but without elaborating\nhow.\n15. In its response, the Respondent State refers to the provisions of Article 56 of the African Charter and\nRule 116 of its [sic] Rules of Procedure which provides for the exhaustion of local remedies as a\nrequirement for the African Commission to rule on the admissibility of communications.\n16. The Respondent State also recalls that the guidelines for submission of communications provide that\neach communication should particularly indicate that local remedies have been exhausted.\n17. The representative of the Respondent State stated during the 33rd Ordinary Session that the\nComplainant had not undertaken any efforts to challenge the decision banning the demonstration.\n18. She pointed out the decision complained of was an administrative measure against which the\nComplainant could have taken legal action and obtained redress in the following two ways:\n1. Appeal to a higher administrative authority which consists of seizing the hierarchical authority for\nabuse of authority, including the Governor, the Minister of Interior, the Prime Minister and, finally,\nthe President of the Republic in accordance with the Institutional Act No. 92-24 of 30th May 1992\nrelating to Conseil d'Etat as amended and Article 729 of the Code of Civil Procedure;\n2. Administrative law action, through seizure of Conseil d'Etat cancelling the administrative decision\ncomplained of for abuse of authority.\n19. The representative of the Respondent State demonstrated that these local remedies existed but that\nthe Complainant had not utilised any of them. She further pointed out that in emergency cases, the\nprocedure of hour by hour interim order in an urgent case was also available to those seeking justice. She\ntherefore concluded that the Complainant had not exhausted local remedies.\n20. In light of the above submissions, the African Commission notes that the Complainant did not provide\nproof of attempting to exhaust the local remedies that were available to him.\n\nHolding\n\nFor these reasons, the African Commission, Declares the communication inadmissible for\nnon-exhaustion of local remedies.\nTaken at the 33rd Ordinary Session in Niamey, Niger, May 2003.\n\n2\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"38","date":"May 29, 2003","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"Refugee rights, Right to information, Freedom of expression, Freedom of assembly","activity_report":"16th Activity Report : 2002 - 2003","outcome":"19"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080ae3e6","title":"Antonie Bissangou","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559106456,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"253_02 Antonie Bissangou _ Congo.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463559107495p0u9ovbybymn29.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463559107495p0u9ovbybymn29.pdf","size":40862},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"253/02 Antonie Bissangou / Congo\nSummary of Facts\n1.

In a letter dated May 20th 1999, the Minister of Justice asked the Minister of Economy, Finance and\nBudget of Congo to enforce the ruling. However, in a letter dated December 30th 1999, the Minister of\nEconomy, Finance and Budget refused to execute the ruling, for no apparent reason.\n\nComplaint\n5. The complainant alleges the violation of violates Articles 2, 3, 21(2) of the African Charter. The\ncomplainant is asking the African Commission to recommend to the Republic of Congo Brazzaville to\ncomply with the ruling which has been passed on behalf of the Congolese people, and to comply at the\nsame time with the provisions of the Charter to which it is signatory.\n\nProcedure\n6. The complaint was received by the Secretariat of the African Commission on 27th June 2002.\n7.

By Note Verbale of 14th July 2006 and by letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the\n[African] Commission's decision.\n38. At its 40th Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th November 2006 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission considered the communication and took a decision on the merits.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n39. The admissibility of communications submitted in conformity with Article 55 of the Charter is governed\nby the conditions spelt out by Article 56 of the same Charter. According to Article 56(5) communications\ncan only be considered if they are submitted \"after the exhaustion of local remedies, if any, unless it is\nobvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged\".\n40.

This judgment was not\ncontested by the Respondent State. A certificate of no appeal had been delivered to the Complainant by\nthe Registrar of the Court.\n42. The Complainant added the certificate of no appeal to the case file, which means that the judgment is\nfinal and should be executed. He produced supporting documents certifying that the file had been\nforwarded by the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of the Economy, Finances and Budget for execution.\nThe Complainant alleges that despite several notices sent requesting it to honour its debt, the Respondent\nState has refused to comply.\n43. The Complainant alleges that the ruling, in relation to which execution is being called for is final and\nbinding. He contends that the certificate of no appeal added to the case file legally establishes that there\nare no other remedies to be brought against the said ruling.\n44. The Complainant alleges that in a country where the rule of law exists, the fact that an Administrative\nOfficer refuses to execute a decision of the Court against which there are no more legal remedies, is a\nconstitutive case of criminal offence.\n45. The Respondent State, in making an oral presentation of its grounds of defence before the African\nCommission during its 34th Ordinary Session, did not contest the facts of the complaint. It however raised a\nplea of inadmissibility regarding the Complainant's request on the grounds that the rule of exhaustion of\nlocal remedies had not been observed.\n46. Regarding the incompatibility with the Charter, the Congolese State alleges that the object of the\ncommunication does not fall under the jurisdiction devolving on the [African] Commission in terms of Article\n45 of the Charter that is to promote and protect human and peoples' rights in Africa. According to the State,\n\"...The [African Charter] has established a non-jurisdictional mechanism to guarantee rights and freedoms,\nthe decisions of the latter having just a moral significance and are not binding. Therefore, the [African]\nCommission could not turn into a jurisdiction to consider requests for the payment of money against states.\"\n47. The [African] Commission observes that the communication is based on allegations of violation of\nprovisions of the Charter which it has the mandate to promote and protect. As the State itself\nacknowledged it in its submission, the African Commission \"controls the conformity of State Parties actions\nto [African Charter]\". The [African] Commission finds that in the case under consideration, in seizing the\n[African] Commission, the Complainant does not have any other intention than to request the latter to play\nits role by controlling the conformity to Articles 2, 3, 21(2) of the Charter of an action (the refusal to enforce\na court decision in favour of the Complainant) of a State party (the Republic of Congo). The [African]\nCommission concludes that the object of the communication falls under its mandate and, as a result, finds\nthat the communication is compatible with the Charter.\n48. Regarding the exhaustion of local remedies, the Respondent State contends that the complainant had a\nremedy against the refusal of the Minister of the Economy, Finances and Budget to execute this ruling in\naccordance with the provisions of Articles 405 to 409 of the Code of Civil, Commercial, Administrative and\nFinancial Procedure. These articles stipulate that: \"any citizen who is qualified and so wishes has the right\n3\n\n\fto bring an appeal for annulment against any regulatory or individual decision by an administrative\nAuthority. Such an appeal must be brought within two (2) months from the date of the publication or\nnotification of the grievance on the one hand, and exceptionally within four (4) months in case of silence\nfrom the administration which is interpreted as an implicit dismissal, on the other...\".\n49. Article 410 of the same Code adds: \"Nonetheless, before applying for the annulment of an\nadministrative decision, the interested Party may present, within 2 months, an appeal to a higher or the\nsame administrative Authority to cancel the said decision. In such a case, the application for annulment will\nonly be effective either from the date of the notification of the dismissal of the administrative appeal, or on\nthe expiry of the 4 months stipulated in the Article 408 mentioned above\"\n50. The Respondent State alleges that in the case under consideration, starting from the date of the\nnotification of the unjustified dismissal of his case by the Minister for Economy, Finance and Budget, the\ncomplainant should have, within 2 months, brought an appeal either to the same administrative authority, or\nto the Head of Government as a higher administrative authority.\n51. The Respondent State contends that such an early administrative appeal would have allowed the\nComplainant to have the negative decision annulled. Otherwise, the Complainant should have secured the\nreal grounds for the dismissal of his claims to allow him make a submission for an annulment at the expiry\nof the above mentioned deadlines.\n52. The Respondent State alleges that since the refusal of the Minister was an administrative decision, the\nAdministrative Chamber of the Supreme Court was competent to deal with its annulment, in accordance\nwith the provisions of Article 3 of law No. 17-99 of 15th April 1999 modifying and supplementing certain\nprovisions of law No. 025-92 of 20th August 1992 and law No. 30-94 of 18th October 1994 governing the\norganisation and functioning of the Supreme Court. This article stipulates that: \"the Supreme Court shall\nrule on appeals relating to abuses of power lodged against decisions from various authorities\".\n53. Finally the Respondent State stresses that the Complainant, an attorney by profession, is hardly\nignorant of the procedural subtleties of Congolese law and that under the circumstances, he should have\nsubmitted his grievances beforehand to the Congolese Courts which have primacy over subsidiary\ninternational appeals.\n54. The Respondent State concluded that the Complainant did not resort to any internal remedy after the\nadministrative decision rejecting his case and, in consequence, did not comply with one of the essential\nrules governing the admissibility of communications before the African Commission, namely that of\nexhaustion of local remedies.\n55. All the conditions laid down by Article 56 have been fulfilled by this communication. However, the rule\nstipulating the exhaustion of local remedies as a requirement for the submission of a communication before\nthe African Commission assumes that the Respondent State should first of all have the opportunity to\ncompensate, by its own means and within the context of its system of domestic law, for any prejudice that\nmay have been caused to an individual.\n56. The African Commission, in communications 48/90, 50/91 [52/91] and 89/93 Amnesty International [et]\nal./Sudan, ruled that all local remedies, if they exist, if they are of a legal nature, are effective and are not\nsubordinate to the discretionary power of the public authorities, should be exhausted.\n57. The [African] Commission is of the view that the Complainant has exhausted all local remedies in\nendeavouring to assert his right to compensation for the prejudice suffered and rejects the Respondent\nState's claims that he should have appealed against the decision of the Minister before seizing the [African]\nCommission.\n58. The [African] Commission notes that no strict legal provision grants the Minister responsible for the\nbudget any authority to refuse to pay damages which are legally granted. The execution of the judgments\nmade against the Respondent State therefore appears to be subject to the regular procedure provided for\nin the Administrative Procedure Code (Article 293 and the following ones).\n59. Under these circumstances, the question which arises is whether the complainant should have initiated\nthe procedures of forced execution against the Respondent State as provided for by the Administrative\nProcedure Code. The [African] Commission considers that it is unreasonable to require from a citizen who\nhas won the case of a payable debt against the State at the end of a legal proceedings to institute\nprocedures of seizure against it (assuming that it is possible to resort to this means of imposition against\nthe public authorities). As it happened, the Complainant, having duly notified his judgment to the competent\nauthorities in accordance with the relevant articles of the Administrative Procedure Code, he had a right to\nexpect the immediate execution of his judgment.1\n\n4\n\n\f60. The [African] Commission is of the view that the Minister had no right to hinder or delay the execution of\na final judgment without legitimate reason. The [African] Commission observes that the decision of the\nMinister was unjustified and that the Respondent State did not, at any time try to clarify to the [African]\nCommission the reasons for the refusal by its Officer. In this context, the [African] Commission supports the\nposition of the European Court according to which even the inability of the Respondent State to pay could\nnot justify the refusal by the Minister to execute a final judgment.2\n61. Furthermore, the [African] Commission considers that the appeal provided for in Article 402 of the\nAdministrative Procedure Code does not constitute a legal remedy which can be used by the complainant.\nThe [African] Commission reiterates that local remedies, if any, should be legal, effective and not subject to\nthe discretionary powers of the public Authorities. Concerning the appeal for annulment provided for in\nArticle 410 of the Administrative Procedure Code, the [African] Commission is not convinced that it would\nhave allowed the Complainant to gain satisfaction. Even a ruling by the Supreme Court setting aside the\nunjustified decision of the Minister would have given the Complainant the power to demand the execution\nof his judgment without however providing him with any means to enforce this ruling. Under these\ncircumstances, the [African] Commission considers this remedy as ineffective.\n62. In conclusion, even assuming that the above-mentioned appeals had enabled the complainant to\nrecover his debt, the [African] Commission observes that the complainant had not been informed of the\nreasons underlying the decision of the Minister, a decision about which, moreover, he does not appear to\nhave been notified.\n63. For these reasons and considering the fact that the complainant had duly exhausted all local remedies,\nthe African Commission declares the communication admissible.\nMerits\n64. The Complainant alleges the violation of Article 2 of the African Charter which stipulates that \"Every\nindividual has the right to enjoy the rights and freedoms recognised and guaranteed in the present\nCharter...\" and the violation of Article 3 of the African Charter which stipulates that \"Every individual shall be\nequal before the law, every individual shall be entitled to equal protection of the law\".\n65. The Complainant contends that the Respondent State does not treat its citizens in the same manner\nand does not guarantee the total equality of its citizens before the law by leaving it to the discretion of the\nMinister of the Economy, Finance and the Budget to choose which judgments to honour. In support of his\nallegations, he alludes to the letter of the Permanent Secretary of the Minister dated 30th December 1999\nwhich rejects, without justification, the request for execution of his judgment and those of two other people.\n66. It is important to point out here that a judgment rendered in the presence of both Parties had jointly and\nseverally condemned the Republic of Congo and the Mayor's Office of Brazzaville to pay the Complainant\nthe amounts of 180,000,000 FCFA representing principal and 15,000,000 FCFA representing damages and\ninterest, in compensation for the prejudice caused to his personal assets and property by the soldiers and\nofficers of the national Police Force during the socio-political upheavals of 1993. Neither the Republic of\nCongo, nor the Brazzaville Mayor's Office lodged an appeal against the judgment, so that the latter became\nfinal on the 19th March 1997. On the 30th December 1999, with no apparent reason, the Permanent\nSecretary of the Minister of the Economy, Finance and Budget informed the Minister of Justice about his\nrefusal to execute the judgment of the Complainant.\n67. The Respondent State does not oppose the facts alleged in this communication but refutes the\nallegations of discrimination. It retorts that the three individuals affected by the Minister's refusal do not\ncome from the same ethnic group or region nor do they share the same religion or political opinion. One of\nthe individuals concerned is even said to be a former Minister of the Government who was actually holding\noffice at the time of the rejection. Under the circumstances, the Congolese State contends that the\ncommunication constitutes an abuse of rights in terms of Rule 144(1)(c) of the African Commission's Rules\nof Procedure.\n68. The two provisions cited by the Complainant repose, on the one hand, on the principle of\nnon-discrimination and on the other, on that of equality. These principles mean that citizens should be\ntreated in a fair and equitable manner before the law and have the right to enjoy, with no distinction\nwhatsoever, the rights guaranteed by the Charter. The right to equality is all the more important since it\ndetermines the possibility for the individual to enjoy many other rights.\n69. Like Article 14\n\n5\n\n\f× The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without\ndiscrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion,\nnational or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\nof the European Convention, Article 2 does not stipulate a general banning of discrimination; it only\nprohibits discrimination where it affects the enjoyment of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter. The\n[African] Commission considers that the Complainant has not adequately supported his claims of\ndiscrimination to show that this Article has been violated; besides, his not having proven how the enjoyment\nof one of the rights guaranteed by the Charter had been hindered in a discriminatory manner, his complaint\nis not based on any of the grounds of discrimination listed out in Article 2 or on grounds similar to the latter.\n70. Nonetheless, the [African] Commission notes that Article 3 of the African Charter contains a general\nguarantee of equality which supplements the ban on discrimination provided for in Article 2. In this regard,\nthe African Charter differs from the European Convention [on Human Rights] and draws inspiration from the\nAgreement on Civil and Political Rights [sic]. Equality before the law, protected by Article 3(1) relates to the\nstatus of individuals before the law. Equal protection by the law, guaranteed in Article 3(2) relates to the\nimplementation of the law and is applicable where the rights of the Complainant are implemented\nunequally.\n71. The [African] Commission further notes that for Article 3 to be applicable, the inequality alleged by the\nComplainant should follow from the 'law'. In this context, the legislative or regulatory Act constitutes the\nmost unambiguous form of law. It is obvious however that Member States could easily circumvent the\nCharter i[f] the term 'law' were to be restricted to these formal methods of legislating. The [African]\nCommission is of the opinion that the Member States would violate Article 3 if they were to exercise a\npower or judgment conferred by a law in a discriminatory manner. As it happens, the refusal by the Minister\nof the Economy, Finance and the Budget is not based on any specific legislative authority. Nevertheless,\nthe [African] Commission feels that it was incumbent on the Minister to honour the judgment by virtue of the\nrule of law and of the principle of the res judicata.\n72. In this context the [African] Commission observes that the complainant was unjustifiably refused the\nimplementation of a legal ruling which had the character of res judicata. The Minister of the Economy,\nFinance and the Budget rejected his request for execution as well as that of two other individuals for no\napparent reason. In [its] claims before the African Commission, the Respondent State did not put forward\nany argument to explain the decision of the Minister in rejecting the Complainant's claim. Moreover, in its\nsubmissions dated 30th March 2004 in reaction to the Complainant's arguments, the State has quoted\nvictims of the same violent events who have been compensated. The Minister thereby transformed the right\nof the Complainant to an effective remedy before the Courts into an illusion and denied him the right to fair\nlegal compensation. Under these circumstances, the [African] Commission is of the view that the decision\nof the Minister arbitrarily deprived the Complainant of the protection of the law accorded to other citizens in\naccordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Charter.\n73. Furthermore, although the Complainant does not specifically mention this Article of the Charter, the\nexamination of the facts shows a violation of Article 7 of the Charter concerning the right to fair trial. The\neffective exercise of this right by individuals requires that:\n\"All State Institutions against which an appeal has been lodged or a legal ruling has been pronounced\nconform fully with this ruling or this appeal.\" 3\n74. The [African] Commission notes that in similar instances, the European Court of Human Rights\ndeclared that the right to access to a Court guaranteed by Article 6(1)\n× In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is\nentitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal\nestablished by law. Judgement shall be pronounced publicly by the press and public may be excluded from\nall or part of the trial in the interest of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society,\nwhere the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or the extent\nstrictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the\ninterests of justice.\nof the European Convention on Human Rights would be illusory if the domestic laws of a State allowed a\nfinal and binding legal ruling to remain ineffective to the detriment of one Party. The Court therefore ruled\nthat the execution of a judgment, no matter from what jurisdiction, should be considered as being an\nintegral part of the 'proceedings' in accordance with Article 6. The Court further recognised that the\neffective protection of the person to be tried and the re-establishment of legality constituted an obligation for\n6\n\n\fthe State to comply with a judgment or ruling pronounced by the highest Court in the land. In consequence,\nby virtue of this Article, the execution of a legal ruling can neither be unduly prevented, nullified nor\ndelayed. 4\n75. The [African] Commission is also of the view that the right to be heard guaranteed by Article 7 of the\nAfrican Charter includes the right to the execution of a judgment. It would therefore be inconceivable for this\nArticle to grant the right for an individual to bring an appeal before all the national courts in relation to any\nact violating the fundamental rights without guaranteeing the execution of judicial rulings. To interpret\nArticle 14 any other way would lead to situations which are incompatible with the rule of law. As a result,\nthe execution of a final judgment passed by a Tribunal or legal court should be considered as an integral\npart of the right to be heard which is protected by Article 7.\n76. Furthermore, the [African] Commission considers that the refusal by the Minister to honour the\njudgment passed in favour of the Complainant also constitutes a violation of Article 14 of the Charter.\nAlthough the complainant only alluded to this Article at the moment of his argument, the [African]\nCommission considers that his initial claims sufficiently supported a claim of violation of the right to\nproperty. Drawing inspiration from the jurisprudence of the European Court for Human Rights under Article\n1 of Protocol No. 1\n× 1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be\ndeprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law\nand by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as\nit deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the\npayment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\"\nof the European Convention on Human Rights,5 the [African] Commission considers that a monetary\ncompensation granted by judgment having acquired the authority of res judicata should be considered as\nan asset. Therefore, the unjustified refusal of the Respondent State to honour the final judgment passed in\nfavour of the Complainant hindered the enjoyment of his assets.\n77. The African Commission appreciates the fact that in spite of the situation which was then prevailing in\nthe Republic of Congo during the period under review, the Court had been able to act rapidly and firmly in\npronouncing the judgments in a bid to restore the rule of law.\n78. The African Commission nonetheless remains conscious of the fact that without a system of effective\nexecution, other forms of private justice can spring up and have negative consequences on the confidence\nand credibility of the public in the justice system.\n79. Finally, the [African] Commission wishes to make some comments with regard to the claims of the\nComplainant based on Article 21(2) of the Charter. This Article stipulates that \"in case of spoliation the\ndispossessed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of their property as well as to an adequate\ncompensation\". The Complainant contends that the Respondent State violated this Article in refusing to\nhonour a judgment of the Brazzaville High Court upholding the total responsibility of the Respondent State\nand that of the Brazzaville Mayor's Office in relation to the looting of his assets by the soldiers and the\nunruly elements of the National Police Force.\n80. The African Charter does not provide a definition of the concept of 'people' that is found in Articles 19 to\n24. This concept nonetheless defines third generation rights whose recognition constitutes the main\ndistinctive feature of the African Charter. Article 21 of the Charter is one of these rights; it guarantees to all\npeoples the right to freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources. Under the terms of this Article, a\npeople stripped of their wealth and natural resources ha[ve] the right to the recovery of its property and to\nan adequate compensation.\n81. In communication 155/96 (2001) Social and Economic Rights Action Center, Centre for Economic and\nSocial Rights/Nigeria, the African Commission recalled in the following terms, the origin of Article 21: \"[This]\nprovision dates back to the colonial period during which the material and human resources of Africa had\nbeen greatly exploited by foreign powers, thus creating a tragedy for the Africans themselves, depriving\nthem of their inalienable rights and land\". Considering its nature and its objective, this Article can only be\nreferred to in the exclusive interest of a people that has the legitimate right to an adequate compensation\nas well as to the recovery of its assets in case of spoliation.\n82. In this case, the movable and immovable property of the complainant that had been destroyed during\nthe socio-political events which shook the country in 1993 does not constitute the wealth and natural\nresources of a people but rather individual assets. It is important to point out that in the present\ncommunication the complainant is acting on his own behalf and on behalf of a group of individuals or of a\n7\n\n\fpopulation living in a given territory. Under these circumstances, the African Commission does not find any\nviolation of Article 21(2) of the African Charter.\n83. The Complainant also requests the [African] Commission to prescribe the Respondent State to pay him\ndamages and a daily penalty for delay in payment of the sum granted to him by a court ruling, which he\nestimates at 200.000.000 FCFA [and] 50.000.000 FCFA respectively.\n84. The [African] Commission, although admitting that the Complainant suffered some loss due to the delay\nin the payment of the sum granted by Congolese courts, does not consider itself in a position to put a figure\nto the loss. This is the reason why, relying on its jurisprudence, especially its decision on communication\n59/916 , the [African] Commission recommends that the amount of the compensation be determined\naccording to Congolese legislation.\n\nDecision of the African Commission\n\nFor these reasons, the African Commission\nObserves that the Republic of Congo is in violation of Articles 3, 7 and 14 of the African Charter;\nSays that there was no violation of Articles 2 and 21(2) of the African Charter;\nUrges the Republic of Congo to harmonise its legislation with that of the African Charter;\nRequests the Republic of Congo to compensate the Complainant as required by paying him the amount\nfixed by the High Court of Brazzaville, namely the global amount of 195,037,000 FCFA equivalent to\n297,333.00 euros;\nFurther requests the Republic of Congo to pay compensation for the loss suffered by the Complainant, the\namount of which shall be determined in accordance with Congolese legislation.\n\nDone at the 40th Ordinary Session of the African Commission held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 15th\n- 29th November 2006.\n\nFootnotes\n1 See the decision of the European Court on Human Rights in the case Metaxas vs. Greece, no. 8415/02,\npara. 19, 27th May 2004.\n2 Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/03, para 34\n× The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil\nrights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal; in this way it embodies the \"right to a court\", of\nwhich the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes\none aspect. However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a\nfinal, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable\nthat Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants - proceedings that are\nfair, public and expeditious - without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article\n6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to\nlead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook\nto respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be\nregarded as an integral part of the \"trial\" for the purposes of Article 6 (see Hornsby v. Greece, judgment of\n19 March 1997, Reports 1997-II, p. 510, § 40)\n7th May 2002, and Ruianu vs. Rumania, no. 34647/97, 17th June 2003.\n3 See Guidelines and Principles on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa.\n4 See, among others, the rulings on Hornsby v.

Ja'neh /\nLiberia\nSummary of Facts\n1. The complaint is filed by Mr Samuel Kofi Woods, II and Mr Kabineh M. Ja'neh on behalf of Hassan Bility,\nAnsumana Kamara and Mohamed Kamara, all Liberian journalists for the independent Analyst Newspaper\nin Monrovia.\n2. The Complainants allege that in the afternoon of 24th June 2002, plain-cloth[ed] state security officers\nfrom the National Police Force, National Security Agency, National Bureau of Investigation, Fire Service,\nImmigration, Ministry of Defence, Anti-Terrorist Unit, Special Security Service, and Ministry of National\nSecurity arrested Hassan Bility, Ansumana Kamara and Mohammed Kamara, all journalists working for the\nindependent Analyst Newspaper in Monrovia.\n3. The complaint also alleges that the said arrest and detention of the journalists was not disputed as the\nMinister of Information, Mr Reginald Goodridge has confirmed the same. To date, there was no charge\nproffered [sic] against them and they continue to languish in detention, which is in contravention of the\nAfrican Charter, the Constitution of Liberia and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n4. It is alleged that in consideration of the available constitutional local remedies vis-?-vis the arbitrary\narrest and detention of these journalists, and further to the petition filed by an assortment of human rights\norganisations in Liberia filed a petition at the First Judicial Circuit Court, Criminal Assizes \"B\" of\nMontserrado County, the latter issued a Special Writ of Habeas Corpus, which, however, was allegedly not\ncomplied with.\n5. The Complainants further allege that the subsequent announcement by the Liberian Government of its\nintention to arraign the detained journalist before a military tribunal would restrain, deprive and deny them\nof their human rights to liberty, freedom and due process of laws as enshrined in the Liberian Constitution,\nthe African Charter, and the UDHR.\n6. Together with their complaint the Complainants submitted a request for provisional measures to the\nAfrican Commission in accordance with Article 111 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\n\nComplaint\n7. The Complainants allege violations of Articles 6, 7(b), and 7(d) of the African Charter.\n8. The Complainants pray that in addition to provisionally ordering the immediate release of the detainees\nin consonance with Article 111 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission, the Commission grant\nany and all other remedies/redress that it shall deem right and appropriate.\n\nProcedure\n9. The Complaint was dated 9th August 2002 and received at the Secretariat on 16th August 2002 by post.\n10. At its 32nd Ordinary Session held from 17th to 23rd October 2002 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission considered the complaint and decided to be seized thereof.\n11. On 23rd October 2002, the African Commission appealed to His Excellency Charles Taylor, President of\nthe Republic of Liberia, respectfully urging him to intervene in the matter being complained of pending the\noutcome of the consideration of the complaint before the African Commission.\n12. On 4th November 2002, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainants and Respondent State to inform\nthem that the African Commission had been seized of the communication and requested them to forward\ntheir submissions on admissibility before the 33rd Ordinary Session of the [African] Commission.\n13. The Secretariat requested the parties on several to submit their arguments on admissibility.\n14. At its 34th Ordinary Session held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission considered this communication and declared it inadmissible.\n\n1\n\n\fLaw\nAdmissibility\n15. Article 56(5) of the African Charter requires that \"a communication be introduced subsequent to\nexhaustion of local remedies, if they exist, unless it is obvious to the Commission that the procedure for\nsuch recourse is abnormally prolonged\".\n16. The Complainants have, despite repeated requests, however, not furnished their submissions on\nadmissibility, especially on the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies.\n\nHolding\n\nFor this reasons, and in accordance with Article 56(5) of the African Charter, the African\nCommission,\nDeclares this communication inadmissible due to non-exhaustion of local remedies.\n\n2\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"25","date":"November 20, 2003","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"Arrest and detention, Right to fair trial","activity_report":"17th Activity Report: 2003 - 2004","outcome":"19"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080afd8a","title":"Kevin Mgwanga Gunme et al","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559106463,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"266_03 Kevin Mgwanga Gunme et al _ Cameroon.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463559107675npkuknsxxtfkcsor.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463559107675npkuknsxxtfkcsor.pdf","size":89050},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"266/03 Kevin Mgwanga Gunme et al / Cameroon\nSummary of Facts\n1. The Complainants are 14 individuals who brought the communication on their behalf and on behalf of the\npeople of Southern Cameroon1 against the Republic of Cameroon, a State Party to the African Charter on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights.\n2. The Complain[an]ts allege violations which can be traced to the period shortly after \"La Republique du\nCameroun\" became independent on 1st January 1960. The Complainants state that Southern Cameroon\nwas a United Nations Trust Territory administered by the British, separately from the Francophone part of\nthe Republic of Cameroon, itself a French administered United Nations Trust Territory. Both became UN\nTrust Territories at the end of the 2nd World War, on 13 December 1946 under the UN Trusteeship System.\n3. The Complainants allege that during the 1961 UN plebiscite, Southern Cameroonians were offered \"two\nalternatives\" , namely: a choice to join Nigeria or Cameroon. They voted for the later. Subsequently,\nSouthern Cameroon and La République du Cameroun, negotiated and adopted the September 1961\nFederal Constitution, at Foumban, leading to the formation of the Federal Republic of Cameroon on 1st\nOctober 1961. The Complainants allege further that the UN plebiscite ignored a third alternative, namely\nthe right to independence and statehood for Southern Cameroon.\n4. The Complainants allege that the overwhelming majority of Southern Cameroonians preferred\nindependence to the two alternatives offered during the UN plebiscite. They favoured a prolonged period of\ntrusteeship to allow for further evaluation of a third alternative. They allege further that the September 1961\nFederal Constitution did not receive the endorsement of the Southern Cameroon House of Assembly.\n5. The Complainants allege that the violations suffered by the people of Southern Cameroon emanate from\nthe UN plebiscite of 11 February 1961 organised to determine the political future of Southern Cameroon,\nand the failure by the Respondent State to abide by the 1961 Federal Constitutional[sic].\n6. They allege that on 1st October 1961 La République du Cameroun, with the tacit approval of the British\ngovernment, drafted gendarmes, police and soldiers from the Francophone side into Southern Cameroon,\nwhich amounted to \"forceful annexation\" of Southern Cameroon. They allege that, >\"[a]t no time was\nsovereignty over Southern Cameroon transferred to a new Federal United Cameroons or any other entity.\"\nThey argue that the failure to exercise the third alternative, impacted negatively on the right of the people of\nSouthern Cameroon to self determination.\n7. The Complainants allege further that \"notwithstanding the forceful annexation,\" the people of Southern\nCameroon remained a separate and distinct people. Their official working language is English, whereas the\npeople in La République du Cameroun are Francophones. The legal, educational and cultural traditions of\nthe two parts remained different, as was the character of local administration. In spite of the foregoing, they\nallege further that the Respondent State manipulate [sic] demographic data to deny the people of Southern\nCameroon equal rights to representation in government. They allege that the people of Southern Cameroon\nhave been denied powerful positions within the national/federal government. They claim that the\nSeptember 1961 Federal Constitution was designed to respect those differences.\n8. The Complainants allege further that from the outset of unification in 1961, and the declaration of a\nunitary state in 1972, Southern Cameroonians remain marginalised. They allege that Southern Cameroon\nwas allocated 20% instead of 22% of the seats in the Federal/National Assembly, as per the population\nratio, thus denying them equal representation. They allege that in 1961 West Cameroon was allocated 20\nrepresentatives in the Federal Assembly instead of 26. Later when representation to the Assembly was\nexpanded to 180 representatives, West Cameroon was allocated 35 representatives, instead of 40\nrepresentatives. The Complainants allege further that the Francophones occupy local administrative\npositions in Southern Cameroon, and abuse their positions to amass land, and access economic\nresources, while the Southern Cameroonians play the minutest role at the local or national level.\n9. It is further alleged that several towns in Southern Cameroon were denied basic infrastructure, hence\ndenying them the right to development. It is alleged that the Respondent State, relocated or located various\neconomic enterprises and projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline, the deep seaport, and the oil\nrefinery to towns and cities in Francophone Cameroon, notwithstanding their lack of economic viability,\nthereby denying employment opportunities and secondary economic benefits to the people of Southern\nCameroon.\n\n1\n\n\f10. The Complainants allege further that the Francophones have monopolistic control of the Ministry of\nNational Education. That the Respondent State has under funded primary education in Southern\nCameroon, it failed to build new schools, understaffed primary schools, and it is closing all teacher training\ncolleges. They allege further that the Respondent State \"Cameroonised\" the GCE from the University of\nLondon, leading to mass protests which forced government to create an independent GCE Board. That,\nupon unification, diplomas awarded by the City & Guild, a technical education institution based in England,\nwere replaced by the Certificat d'Aptitude Professionelle (CAP) and the BAC Technique. These measures\nhave resulted in persistent high levels of illiteracy in many areas in Southern Cameroon.\n11. The Complainants allege that political unification and the application of the civil law system resulted in\nthe discrimination against Anglophones in the legal and judicial system. Southern Cameroonian companies\nand businesses were forced to operate under the civil law system. The Companies Ordinance of the\nFederation of Nigeria, which was until then applicable in Southern Cameroon, was abolished. Many\nSouthern Cameroonian businesses went bankrupt, following the refusal by Francophone banks to lend\nthem finances, in some cases, unless their articles of association were drafted in French.\n12. They allege that Anglophones facing criminal charges were transferred to the Francophone zone for\ntrial, under the Napoleonic Code, thereby adversely affecting their civil rights. The Complainants state that\nthe common law presumption of innocence upon arrest is not recognised under the civil law tradition, since\nguilt is presumed upon arrest and detention. The courts conduct trial in the French language without\ninterpreters. Furthermore, they allege that Southern Cameroon court decisions are ignored by the\nRespondent State.\n13. The Complainants allege that the entry by the Respondent State as a State Party to the Organisation\npour l'Harmonisation des Droits d'Affaires en Afrique (OHADA), a treaty for the harmonisation of business\nlegislation amongst Francophone countries in Africa, constituted discrimination against the people of\nSouthern Cameroon on the basis of language. OHADA stipulates that the language of interpretation of the\ntreaty shall be French. The Complainants argue that the Constitution recognises English and French as the\nofficial languages of Cameroon. They argue therefore that by signing the OHADA treaty, Cameroon\nviolated the language rights of the English speaking people of Cameroon. They allege that any company\nnot registered under the OHADA law cannot open a bank account in Cameroon.\n14. The Complainants allege further that, on 3rd April 1993, representatives of the people of Anglophone\nCameroon adopted the Buea Declaration, which declared the preparedness of the Anglophones \"... to\nparticipate in the forthcoming constitutional talks with their Francophone brothers...\". The Declaration stated\nthat:\n1. \"...the imposition of the Unitary State on Anglophone Cameroon in 1972 was unconstitutional, illegal\n2.\nand a breach of faith,\n3. That the only redress adequate to right the wrongs done to Anglophone Cameroon and its people\nsince the imposition of the Unitary state is a return to the original form of government of the\nReunified Cameroon,\n4. That to this end, all Cameroonians of Anglophone heritage are committed to working for the\nrestoration of a federal Constitution and a federal form of government, which takes cognizance of\nthe bicultural nature of Cameroon and under which citizens shall be protected against such\nviolations as have been enumerated.\n5. That the survival of Cameroon in peace and harmony depends upon the attainment of this objective\ntowards which all patriotic Cameroonians, Francophones as well as Anglophones, should\nrelentlessly work.\"\n15. Subsequent to the 1993 Buea Declaration, it is alleged that between 29th April and 1st May 1994, the\nSecond Anglophone Conference convened in Bamenda adopted the Bamenda Proclamation, which stated,\ninter alia, that: \"....one year since the Anglophone constitutional proposals were officially submitted, the\ngovernment had not reacted to them;\nthat all efforts to generate the interest and understanding of the Francophone officials and Francophone\npublic generally in the Anglophone constitutional proposals had been greeted with responses ranging from\nindifference through apathy to hostility...\"\nIN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING the Anglophone people of Cameroon...; reiterated the Resolution\ntaken at its first session in April 1993... It stated further in paragraph 6 of the Proclamation that; \"6. Should\nthe Government either persist in its refusal to engage in meaningful constitutional talks or fail to engage in\n2\n\n\fsuch talks within a reasonable time, the Anglophone Council shall inform the Anglophone people by all\nsuitable means. It shall, thereupon, proclaim the revival of the independence and sovereignty of the\nAnglophone territory of Southern Cameroon and take all measures necessary to secure, defend and\npreserve the independence, sovereignty and integrity of the said territory.\" (emphasis added)\n16. The Complainants allege that the failure by the Respondent State to address the concerns of the\nSouthern Cameroon people for a new constitution, coupled with the adoption of the 1995 December\nConstitution by the National Assembly of La République du Cameroun without public debate, meant that\nthe door was being finally closed on any future constitutional links between the Southern Cameroon and La\nRépublique du Cameroun. Henceforth, the Complainants decided to conduct a signature referendum, in\nview of >\"the hostile atmosphere created by the occupying power... which would not want to allow any form\nof consultation which might reveal the true suppressed aspirations of the people of Southern Cameroons.\"\n17. The Complainants aver that between 1st and 30th September 1995, the Southern Cameroons National\nCouncil (SCNC) conducted a signature referendum which revealed that 99% of Southern Cameroonians\nfavour full independence by peaceful separation from the Respondent State.\n18. Besides their claim for statehood, the Complainants allege further that human rights of various\nindividuals have been systematically violated by the Respondent State. The Complainants compiled eye\nwitness accounts and field investigations relating to arbitrary arrests, detentions, torture, punishment,\nmaiming and killings of persons who have advocated for the self determination of Southern Cameroon.\n\nComplaint\n19. The Complainants allege that;\n\n1. Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7(1), 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17(1), 19, 20, 21, 22, 23(1), 24 of the African Charter\nhave been violated.\n2. the Republic of Cameroon has violated its general duty under Article 26 of the African Charter to\nguarantee the independence of the judiciary.\n\nProcedure\n20. The complaint was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 9th January 2003.\n21. On 10 January 2003, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the complaint.\n22. On 19 January 2003, the Secretariat wrote another letter to the Complainants requesting for further\ninformation relating to the communication.\n23. On 21 April 2003, the Secretariat sent a reminder to the Complainants requesting them to forward their\nclarifications. By a letter dated 8 May 2003, Counsel for the Complainants sent the clarifications sought by\nthe Secretariat.\n24. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held from 15-29 May 2003 in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\nconsidered the communication and decided to be seized of the matter.\n25. On 9 June 2003, the Secretariat informed the parties that the African Commission had been seized with\nthe matter and requested them to forward their submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\n26. On 9 September 2003, the Complainants informed the Secretariat that they would be forwarding their\nsubmissions on admissibility and requested to make oral submissions at the 34th Session of the African\nCommission.\n27. On 22 September 2003, the Secretariat received the Complainant's submissions on admissibility along\nwith supplemental evidence. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt thereof on the same day.\n28. On 3 October 2003, the Respondent State informed the Secretariat that it had not received a copy of\nthe communication forwarded to it by DHL on 9th June 2003.\n\n3\n\n\f29. On 6 October 2003, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainant requesting for another copy of the\nsupplemental evidence to be forwarded to the Respondent State.\n30. On 27 October 2003, the Secretariat transmitted a copy of the Complainant's submissions on\nadmissibility to the Respondent State and informed the latter that the Secretariat would give the\naccompanying documents to the delegation of Cameroon attending the 34th Ordinary Session. The\nSecretariat also informed the Respondent State that the DHL office in Cameroon had confirmed delivery of\nthe communication.\n31. On 27 October 2003, the Secretariat received another copy of the supplemental evidence from the\nComplainant for onward transmission to the Respondent State. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of\nthe same.\n32. At its 34th Ordinary Session held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission examined the matter and decided to defer consideration on admissibility of the matter to the\n35th Ordinary Session because the Respondent State claimed that they were unaware of the\ncommunication.\n33. On 14 November 2003, the Secretariat furnished the delegates representing the Respondent State at\nthe 34th Ordinary Session with the following documents:\n• A copy of communication 266/2003;\n• A copy of the Complainants' submissions on admissibility and the accompanying documents.\n34. On 4 December 2003, both parties to the communication were informed of the decision of the African\nCommission to defer consideration of the matter on admissibility to the 35th Ordinary Session. The\nRespondent State was reminded to forward its submissions on admissibility to the Secretariat of the African\nCommission within 3 months.\n35. On 5 March 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission received the Respondent State's\nsubmissions on admissibility and acknowledged receipt of the same on 9 March 2004.\n36. At its 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 21 May - 4 June 2004, the African\nCommission heard the oral submissions of the parties, and declared the communication admissible.\n37. On 15 June 2004, the Secretariat informed the parties about the African Commission's decision and\nrequested them to submit their written submissions on the merits within 3 months.\n38. On 13 August 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a correspondence from the\nRespondent State, which was forwarded to the Complainant on 26 August 2004.\n39. On 20 September 2004, the Secretariat received the written submissions of the Respondent State on\nmerits, which was transmitted to the Complainants on 12 November 2004.\n40. On 23 and 28 September 2004, the Secretariat received the written submissions of the Complainants\non the merits, which was transmitted to the Respondent State on 12 November 2004.\n41. At its 36th Ordinary Session held in Dakar, Senegal from 24 November - 7 December 2004, the African\nCommission decided to defer its consideration on the merits to the next session. It also rejected an\napplication to stay the proceedings by third parties purporting to represent the applicants claiming to have\nentered into negotiation with the Respondent State.\n42. On 23 December 2004, the Secretariat wrote to the said third parties informing them of this decision.\n43. The Commission also decided to forward the decision on admissibility of the communication to the\nRespondent State, upon its request.\n44. On 30 March 2005, the Secretariat received further submissions from the Complainants, who also\nrequested to make an oral presentation to the next session.\n45. On 31 March 2005, the Secretariat handed over copies of the decision on admissibility and the various\nsubmissions from the Complainants to the delegation of the Respondent State that visited the Secretariat\non the same date.\n46. At the 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 27 April - 11 May 2005, the African\nCommission considered this communication and decided to defer its decision to the 38th Ordinary Session.\n47. On 7 May 2005, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State of this decision.\n48. The Complainants were notified of the decision on 13 May 2005.\n49. On 7 June 2005, the Secretariat received submissions from the Complainant, which were sent to the\nRespondent State.\n50. On 12 July 2005, the Secretariat received submissions from the Respondent State, which were later\nsent to the Complainant.\n4\n\n\f51. At the 38th Ordinary Session held from 21 November - 5 December 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nAfrican Commission considered the communication and deferred its decision on the merits to the 39th\nOrdinary Session.\n52. On 30 January 2006, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State of this decision.\n53. The Complainants were notified of this decision on 5th February 2006.\n54. At the 39th Ordinary session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 11 - 25 May 2006, the African\nCommission considered the communication and decided to defer it for further consideration at the 40th\nOrdinary Session.\n55. At the 40th Ordinary session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 14 - 28 November 2006, the African\nCommission considered the communication and decided to defer its decision on the merits to the 41st\nSession.\n56. At the 41st Ordinary Session held in Accra, Ghana, from 16 - 30 May 2007 the Commission considered\nthe communication and deferred its decision to allow more time for the Secretariat to conduct further\nresearch and finalise the draft decision.\n57. At the 42nd Ordinary session held in Brazzaville, Congo, from 14 - 28 November 2007, the African\nCommission considered the communication and decided to defer it for further consideration at the 43rd\nOrdinary Session.\n58. At the 43rd Ordinary Session held in Ezulwini, Swaziland, from 7 - 22 May 2008, the African\nCommission considered the communication and decided to defer its decision on the merits to the 44th\nOrdinary Session.\n59. At the 44th Ordinary Session held in Abuja, Nigeria, from 10 - 24 November 2008, the African\nCommission considered the communication and decided to defer it to the 45th Ordinary Session in order to\nfinalise the draft decision on the merits.\n60. During the 6th Extra Ordinary session held from 28 March - 3 April 2009 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nCommission considered the communication and resolved to finalise it during the 45th Ordinary Session.\n61. At the 45th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, between 13 and 27 May 2009, the\nCommission adopted the decision on the merits of the communication.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n62. The admissibility of communications brought pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter is governed\nby the conditions stipulated in Article 56 of the African Charter. This Article lays down seven (7) conditions,\nwhich must be fulfilled by a Complainant for a communication to be declared admissible.\n63. Of the seven conditions, the Respondent State claims that the Complainants have not fulfilled four,\nnamely: Articles 56(1), 56(2), 56(3) and 56(4). From the submissions of the Respondent State, there is an\ninference that Article 56(7) has not been fulfilled by the Complainant.\n64. The Respondent State submits that contrary to Article 56(1) of the African Charter, the victims of the\nalleged violations, indicated in the communication have not been identified.\n65. Article 56(1) of the African Charter provides that:\nCommunications ... received by the Commission shall be considered if they:\n1. Indicate their authors even if the latter request anonymity\n66. In this particular matter, the African Commission notes that the authors of the communication have\nbeen identified at page 1 of the communication and they are 14 in number. Their ages and professions\nhave also been given as well as their addresses of service. Furthermore, the communication reveals that\nthe authors of the communication are members of the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC) and\nthe Southern Cameroons Peoples' Organisation (SCAPO), organisations that were established principally\nto protect and advance the human and peoples' rights of Southern Cameroonians, including their right to\nself-determination.\n\n5\n\n\f67. Article 56(1) of the African Charter requires a communication to indicate its authors and not the victims\nof the violations. Thus the present communication cannot be declared inadmissible on the basis of Article\n56(1). In coming to this decision, the African Commission would like to refer to its decision in consolidated\ncommunication - Malawi African Association et al/ Mauritania2 where it held that \"Article 56.1 demands\nsimply that communications should indicate the names of those submitting and not those of all the victims\nof the alleged violations\".\n68. The Respondent State argues that this communication does not meet the requirements of Article 56(2),\nbecause the Complainants are advocating for secession under the pretext of allegations of violation of the\nprovisions of the African Charter and other universal human rights instruments. While conceding that the\nright to self determination is an inalienable right, the Respondent State argues that the UN has established\nthat this right should not \"be interpreted as authorising or encouraging any measure that would partly or\nwholly compromise the entire territory or the political unity of sovereign and independent States\". The\nRespondent State submits further that it is established that the only entities likely as peoples to call for the\nexternal right to self determination from preexisting States are the \"peoples under foreign subjugation,\ndomination and exploitation\".\n69. The Complainants argue that the communication meets the requirements in Article 56(2) because it\nalleges violations of the African Charter and other international human rights instruments.\n70. Article 56(2) provides that \"Communications... received by the African Commission shall be considered\nif they:\n(2) are compatible with the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present Charter.\"\n71. The condition relating to compatibility with the African Charter basically requires that:\n• The communication should be brought against a State party to the African Charter3\n• The communication must allege prima facie violations of rights protected by the African Charter4\n• The communication should be brought in respect of violations that occurred after [the] State's\nratification of the African Charter, or where violations began before the State Party ratified the\nAfrican Charter, have continued even after such ratification5\n72. It is apparent to the African Commission that the present communication meets all the above\nrequirements. The communication has been brought against Cameroon, which is State party to the African\nCharter. It reveals prima facie violations of the African Charter, all of which are alleged to have continued to\noccur following Cameroon's ratification of the African Charter.\n73. The Respondent State also submits that the communication has been written in disparaging or insulting\nlanguage. The Respondent State argues that the Complainants' use of the phrases such as \"forceful\nannexation\" and \"State sponsored terrorism\" to characterise violations by the government of Cameroon\nagainst the people of Southern Cameroons, allegedly committed between 1961 and 2002 and a report titled\n\"Let My People Go Part II\", are disparaging and insulting language, contrary to Article 56(3) of the African\nCharter.\n74. Article 56(3) of the African Charter provides that: Communications ... received by the Commission shall\nbe considered if they: (3) Are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State\nconcerned and its institutions or to the Organisation of African Unity.\n75. The African Commission acknowledges that the above-mentioned provision is quite subjective because\nstatements that could be disparaging or insulting to one person may not be seen in the same light by\nanother person. Matters relating to human rights violations normally elicit strong language from the victims\nof the said violations. Nonetheless Complainants should endeavour to be respectful in the phrases they\nchoose to use when presenting their communications.\n76. The Respondent State submits further that the Complainants are not the sole authors of some of the\ndocuments and that the facts have been distorted.\n77. The Complainants submit that they did not author the offensive publication, but rely on it to buttress\ntheir allegations. They argue further that the communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated\nthrough the media. They state that the evidence in support of their allegations is based on eye-witness\naccounts and documents prepared by those who have personal knowledge of the events and from official\nrecords.\n78. Article 56(4) of the African Charter provides that: Communications ... received by the Commission shall\nbe considered if they: (4) are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media\n6\n\n\f79. The African Commission has perused the appendices to the communication and has observed that they\ncontain the following documents:\n• Appendix II is a publication by SCNC/SCAPO - Let my People Go!\n• Appendix IV contains court documents, namely a motion on notice, 2 affidavits, originating\nsummons, a ruling of the Federal High Court of Nigeria in Abuja, terms agreed by the parties to be\nembodied in the order of the court and an enrolment of order. [[/li]]\n• Exhibit SC contains among others numerous documents, declarations, agreements between\nGermany and Great Britain, UN General Assembly Resolutions, the Statute of the International\nCourt of Justice and the UN Charter, a Petition made by the Federal Republic of Southern\nCameroons to the United Nations etc.\n80. Article 56(4) relates to communications brought before the African Commission based exclusively on\nnews disseminated through the mass media. Looking at the nature of documents described herein above, it\nis quite clear that the Complainants do not base their case on mass media news, but on official records and\ndocuments, as well as international statutes. This clearly falls outside the ambit of Article 56(4).\n81. With respect to Article 56(5) , which relates to exhaustion of local remedies, the Complainants submit\nthat there are no local remedies to exhaust in respect of the claim for self-determination because this is a\nmatter for an international forum and not a domestic one. They argue that the issue for determination in this\ncommunication is whether or not the \"union\" of La République du Cameroun and Southern Cameroons was\neffected in accordance with UN Resolutions, International Treaty obligations and indeed International law.\nThey assert that the right to self determination is a matter that cannot be determined by a domestic court.\n82. The Respondent State concedes that no local remedies exist with respect to the claim for self\ndetermination. The Respondent State, however argues that, the right to self determination for the people of\nSouthern Cameroon was solved when the British Trusteeship over British Cameroon ended following the\nplebiscite of 11th and 12th February 1961. Furthermore, it argues that the 1963 International Court of\nJustice (ICJ) decision in the Northern Cameroon case found in favour of the Republic of Cameroon and put\nthe matter of Southern Cameroon to rest. The Respondent State believes that the Complainants are\nseeking a similar declaratory decision which should not be entertained by the African Commission.\n83. The African Commission believes that this argument is an inference by the Respondent State that the\nComplainants have not met the conditions laid down in Article 56(7) of the African Charter. Article 56(7)\nprovides: Communications ... received by the African Commission shall be considered if they: (7) do not\ndeal with cases which have been settled by these States involved in accordance with the principles of the\nCharter of the United Nations, or the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or the provisions of the\npresent Charter.\n84. Article 56(7) of the African Charter bars the African Commission from entertaining cases that have been\nsettled by another international settlement procedure.6 The issue that the African Commission needs to\nexamine is whether the abovementioned complaint has been settled by some other international settlement\nprocedure.\n85. The African Commission has read the judgment of the ICJ in the Northern Cameroons case7 . In that\ncase the Government of the Republic of Cameroon asked the Court to declare whether, \"in the application\nof the Trusteeship Agreement for the Territory of the Cameroons under the British Administration, the\nUnited Kingdom failed, with regard to the Northern Cameroons, to respect certain obligations flowing from\nthat Agreement.\"8\n86. It is the view of the African Commission that the matter before the ICJ was unrelated to the issues\nbefore the African Commission. The African Commission states that for a matter to fall within the scope of\nArticle 56(7) of the African Charter it should have involved the same parties, the same issues, raised by the\ncomplaint before the African Commission, and must have been settled by an international or regional\nmechanism. The case before the ICJ was between the Republic of Cameroon and the United Kingdom,\nand involved the interpretation and application of the Trusteeship treaty. These facts clearly differ from the\ncomplaint before the Commission. As such the case falls outside the scope of Article 56(7) of the African\nCharter.\n87. For the reasons outlined herein above, the African Commission declares this communication\nadmissible.\n\n7\n\n\fPreliminary issue raised by the Respondent State regarding the jurisdiction of the African Commission\n\n88. Before dwelling on the substance of the allegations, the Commission wishes to dispose of some\npreliminary legal issues raised by the Respondent State. The Respondent State questions the\nCommission's jurisdiction rationae temporis, and states the following: \"...the complaint by the Complainants\ncontains an impressive number of cases of so called massive violations of human rights which [are] alleged\nto have been carried out between 1961 and 2002. In this regard, the State of Cameroon refuses to\nacknowledge in limine litis the jurisdiction rationae temporis of the Commission with regard to acts before\n18 December 1989, the date of entry into force of the Charter.\"\n89. The Respondent State also challenged the notion, or the existence of a territory known as \"Southern\nCameroon.\" It states as follows: \"....it should be pointed out that in spite of the fact that the complainants\nrefused to reveal their identities, they by no means ascertained to have been victims9 of violations imputed\nto the State of Cameroon. And even when they act on behalf of a so called territory called Southern\nCameroon. The State of Cameroon will point out that no territory exists called as such in the Republic of\nCameroon...\"\n90. The Respondent State, similarly, questions the existence of a \"people\" known as \"Southern\nCameroonians\" and as such states that, \"...[s]upposing that there are a people of Southern Cameroons,\nnevertheless, it would have to be proven that it is entitled to claim its self determination, under the specific\nform of 'separate statehood'.\"\n91. The Commission proposes to deal, firstly, with the question of its jurisdiction then the question whether\nthe people of \"Southern Cameroon\" exist as a \"people\" and whether the territory otherwise referred to as\n\"Southern Cameroon\" does exist, and if it does, can its \"people\" exercise their alleged \"right to\nself-determination?\"\nDecision on the preliminary issue of the Commission's jurisdiction rationae temporis\n\n92. The Respondent State raises objection to the Commission's exercise of jurisdiction rationae temporis.\nThe Complainants responded that although those violations were carried out before the African Charter\ncame into force for Cameroon, they did not stop even after 18 December 1989.\n93. The Commission acknowledges the Respondent State's argument that its jurisdiction rationae temporis\nis limited in limine, and as such it cannot address violations retrospective [of] the entry into force of the\nCharter. The Commission is aware that the Africa Charter entered into force in respect of the Respondent\nState on 18 December 1989. The Commission has been informed by the Complainants that some of the\nalleged violations occurred before that date.\n94. The Commission stated its position on this principle in communication 97/93 John K. Modise v.\nBotswana. In that communication the Complainant was arrested by the Botswana authorities in 1978 and\ndeported to apartheid South Africa, in violation of his citizenship rights. The communication was filed in\n1993. The Commission held that: \"The Republic of Botswana ratified the African Charter on 17 July 1986.\nAlthough some of the events described in the communication took place before ratification, their effects\ncontinue to the present day. The current circumstances of the Complainant are a result of a present policy\ndecision taken by the Botswana government against him.\"\n95. The Commission expanded the principle further in its decision on the consolidated communications\nNos 54/91 [61-91, 98-93, 164-197, 210-98] Malawi African Association et al v. Mauritania, where it, inter\nalia, considered an allegation of violations of the right to a fair trial. The Commission held that: \"Mauritania\nratified the Charter on 14 June 1986, and it came into force on 21 October 1986. The September trials, thus\ntook place prior to the entry into force of the Charter. These trials led to the imprisonment of various\npersons. The Commission can only consider a violation that took place prior to the entry into force of the\nCharter if such a violation continues or has effects which themselves constitute violations after the entry\ninto force of the Charter...\"10\n96. The Commission has through its jurisprudence established the principle that violations that occurred\nprior to the entry into force of the Charter, in respect of a State party, shall be deemed to be within the\njurisdiction rationae temporis of the Commission, if they continue, after the entry into force of the Charter.\nThe effects of such violations may themselves constitute violations under the Charter. In other words, this\nprinciple presupposes the failure by the State party to adopt measures, as required by Article 1 of the Africa\nCharter to redress the violations and their effects, hence failing to respect, and guarantee the rights.\n\n8\n\n\f97. The Commission therefore decides that it has the competence to consider this complaint against the\nRespondent State, in relation to violations which emanated prior to 18 December 1989, the date the African\nCharter entered into force for the Republic of Cameroon, if such violations or their residual effects\ncontinued after that date.\n\nConsideration of the Merits\n\n98. The communication alleges that the Respondent State violated Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7(1), 9, 10, 11, 12,\n13, 17(1) in respect of individual Southern Cameroonians; and Articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23(1) and 24 in\nrespect of the peoples of Southern Cameroons; and the general obligation under Article 26 of the African\nCharter.\n\nDecision on the Merits\nAlleged violation of Article 2\n\n99. The Complainants allege that there have been various cases of discrimination against the people of\nSouthern Cameroon contrary to Article 2 of the African Charter. Article 2 states that: \"Every individual shall\nbe entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognised and guaranteed in the present Charter\nwithout distinction of any kind such as race, ethnic group, colour, sex, language, religion, political or any\nother opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or any status\".\n100. The Complainants submit that Southern Cameroonians are discriminated against by the Respondent\nState, in various forms. These include under-representation of Southern Cameroonians in national\ninstitutions, economic marginalisation through the denial of basic infrastructure, such as roads, persistence\nhigh levels of unemployment and illiteracy in Southern Cameroon. It is submitted that Southern\nCameroonians are discriminated against in the legal and judicial system.\n101. The Complainants submitted further that the company law applied in Southern Cameroon was\nabolished in favour of the Napoleonic Code upon unification in 1972. They argued that Southern\nCameroonians could not register companies whose articles of association were in the English language.\n102. The issue for determination is whether the refusal to register the said companies was directly related\nto the unification of the legal system in 1972, and if it constituted discrimination? Could the 1972 unification\nprejudice registration of companies after ratification on 18 December 1989? This would be the case only if\nthe unification impacted negatively on the registration of companies after December 1989. The\nComplainants argue that the refusal to register companies had such an effect. In order for the Southern\nCameroonian companies to do business they had to register under the Francophone civil law system. The\nRespondent State did not dispute this allegation. English is one of the official languages in Cameroon.\nSouthern Cameroonians had a legitimate expectation that the English language could be used to conduct\nofficial business, including the registration of companies. The Commission makes a finding that the refusal\nto register companies established by Southern Cameroonians on account of language amounted to a\nviolation of Article 2 of the African Charter.\n103. The Complainants submit further that the ratification of the Treaty for the Harmonisation of Business\nLaw in Africa, otherwise known as Organisation pour l'Hamonisation des Droits d'Affaires en Afrique\n(OHADA), has discriminated against the people of Southern Cameroon on the basis of language. OHADA\nis an instrument harmonising business law amongst French speaking countries in Africa. It states that the\nlanguage of interpretation and settlement of disputes arising under OHADA shall be French.\n104. The Complainants alleged that the ratification of OHADA was discriminatory to individual businesses\nand business people from Southern Cameroon. At this point we adopt the legal principle that businesses or\ncorporate bodies are legal persons. The Complainants submit that objections against OHADA were\nignored, and that companies not registered under OHADA could not open bank accounts in Cameroon.\n105. The Respondent State argued that OHADA is not aimed at promoting the superiority of one legal\nsystem over the other, but rather to harmonise business law in the contracting states by elaborating simple,\nmodern, common rules aimed at encouraging regional development and growth, setting up appropriate\njudicial procedures and encouraging arbitration for the settlement of contractual disputes.\n9\n\n\f106. It states further that other non French speaking countries including Ghana and Nigeria, were\nundergoing the process of acceding to the OHADA treaty. The Respondent State submitted that it had\ntaken several measures, such as the translation of the OHADA laws into English, with the support of the\nOHADA Permanent Secretariat and the African Development Bank, and the training of Anglophone and\nFrancophone magistrates at the Ecole regionale superieure de la Magistature in Porto Novo, Republic of\nBenin. It stated further that the apprehension by the Anglophones was merely a transitory situation.\n107. The Commission takes note of the fact that the Respondent State had taken measures to address the\ndiscriminatory effects of the ratification of OHADA. Had such measures not been taken upon the ratification\nof OHADA in 1996, the Commission would not have hesitated to find a violation. The Commission is\ncognisant of the bilingual nature of the Respondent State and the Western African region, in which the\nRespondent State finds itself. The Respondent State is from time to time being expected to interact with its\nneighbours in ECOWAS, or any other sub regional group, where both the French and the English language\ncontinue to be lingua franca.\n108. The mere accession or ratification of OHADA should not be deemed a violation of Article 2, unless the\nRespondent State had manifestly failed to take any steps to ameliorate the effects of the linguistic\ndifferences. The Respondent State has shown that it took measures, such as the training of magistrates,\nand translation of texts to address the discriminatory concerns. The OHADA ratification, however, resulted\nin the discrimination of Anglophone based companies and businesses, which could not open bank\naccounts unless they registered under OHADA. There was no response from the Respondent State on this\nissue. Nor were any measures taken to address this complaint. Notwithstanding the translation of OHADA\ninto English, it was wrong for institutions, such as banks to force Southern Cameroon based companies to\nchange their basic documents into French. The banks and other institutions could have dealt with the\ncompanies without imposing the language conditionality. Banking documents should have been translated\ninto English. The Commission finds that the Respondent State failed to address the concerns of Southern\nCameroonian businesses, which were forced to re-register under OHADA, and as such violated Article 2 of\nthe African Charter.\n\nAllegation of violation of Article 3\n\n109. The Complainants alleged violation of Article 3, which protects the individual's right to equality before\nthe law and equal protection of the law. African Commission notes that although the communication alleges\nviolation of Article 3 of the African Charter, the Complainants did not specifically argue or bring evidence of\nany instance against the Respondent State. In the absence of such evidence, the African Commission\ncannot find violation of Article 3 of the Charter.\n\nAlleged violation of Article 4\n\n110. The Complainants allege violations of Article 4, the right to life, inviolability of the human being, and\nthe integrity of the person. They submit that the Respondent State committed violations against individuals\nin Southern Cameroon. The communication gives account of people who were killed by the police during\nviolent suppressions of peaceful demonstrations, or died in detention as a result of the bad conditions and\nthe ill-treatment in prison.\n111. The Respondent State contends that the allegations are not substantiated by documentary evidence.\nNo certificates to ascertain the cause of death, no forensic medical certificates, no investigation reports by\nhuman rights organisation were produced. It states further that \"the catalogue published by the press\norgans of the SCNC and SCAPO cannot be considered as a reliable source\".11 The Respondent State\nhowever, admitted to the death of six people on the 26th March 1990, which occurred after a confrontation\nbetween security forces and demonstrators, whom it argued, were involved in an illegal political rally in\nBamenda.\n112. The African Commission observes that the parties do not have equal access to official evidence such\nas police reports, death certificates and forensic medical certificates. The Complainants endeavoured to\ninquire into the alleged violations and gave names of the alleged victims. The Respondent State restricted\nitself to questioning the reliability of the evidence presented by the Complainants. It did not deny the\n10\n\n\falleged violations. The Respondent State had the opportunity to inquire into the alleged violations. The\nRespondent State did not conduct such investigation and redress the victims, it thus failed to protect the\nrights of the alleged victims. The Commission finds that it violated Article 4 of the African Charter.\n\nAlleged violation of Article 5\n\n113. The communication gives details of victims who were subjected to torture, amputations and denial of\nmedical treatment by the Respondent State's law enforcement officers, in violation of Article 5 of the African\nCharter. The Respondent State responded by stating that some SCNC and SCAPO members had\nperpetrated terrorist acts in the country, killing law enforcement officers, vandalising State properties,\nstealing weapons and ammunitions.\n114. The Commission holds the view that even if the State was fighting alleged terrorist activities, it was not\njustified to subject victims to torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and treatment. It therefore\nfinds that the Respondent State violated Article 5 of the African Charter.\n\nAlleged violation of Article 6\n\n115. The communication further gives details of victims who were arrested, detained for days, sometimes\nfor months without trial before being released in violation of Article 6 of the Charter.\n116. The Respondent State did not deny the allegations instead it tried to justify them. For instance, it\nstates that: \"...concerning citizens who had been arrested for committing various ordinary law offences\nsince the return to multi party democratic processes, most of them are SCNC and SCAPO activists who, in\ntheir logic of contestation, defied republican institutions especially the forces of law and order, either during\ndemonstration of the anniversary of \"Southern Cameroon\" every 1 October of the year, or at the approach,\nduring and after important elections.\"\n117. It goes on to state that, \"whatever the circumstances, the more it is true that every individual shall\nhave the right to liberty and the security of his person, the more it is accepted that an individual may be\ndeprived of his freedom for reason and conditions previously laid down by the law. (Article 6 of the Charter)\nThe cases of arrest registered since the return to multiparty politics in this part of the territory has always\nobeyed the principle of legality...\" .\n118. The Commission states that a State Party cannot justify violations of the African Charter by relying on\nthe limitation under Article 6 of the Charter. The Respondent State is required to convince the Commission\nthat the measures or conditions it had put in place were in compliance with Article 6 of the Charter. The\nCommission has previously expressed itself on the effect of claw back clauses. Communication 211/98\nLegal Resources Foundation/Zambia,12 states the following; \"The Commission has argued forcefully that\nno State Party to the Charter should avoid its responsibility by recourse to the limitations and \"claw back\"\nclauses in the Charter. It was stated following developments in other jurisdictions, that the Charter cannot\nbe used to justify violations of sections of it. The Charter must be interpreted holistically and all clauses\nmust reinforce each other. The purpose or effect of any limitation must also be examined, as the limitation\nof the right cannot be used to subvert from the popular will, as such cannot be used to limit the\nresponsibilities of State Parties in terms of the Charter.\"\n119. Further to the foregoing, communication 147/95 and 149/96, Sir Dawda Jawara/The Gambia, the\nCommission stated that, \"[t]he Commission in its decision on communication 101/93 laid down a general\nprinciple with respect to freedom of association, that 'competent authorities should not enact provisions\nwhich limit the exercise of this freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional\nprovisions or undermine fundamental rights guaranteed by constitution or international human rights\nstandards.' This therefore applies not only to right to freedom of expression of association, but also to all\nother rights and freedoms ... for a State to avail itself of this plea, it must show that such a law is consistent\nwith its obligations under the Charter.\" 13\n120. In view of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the Respondent State has violated Article 6 as\nalleged by the Complainants.\n\n11\n\n\fAlleged violation of Article 7(1)\n\n121. The Complainants alleged that the Respondent State violated Article 7(1), on the right to fair trial.\nThey allege that individuals were transferred from Southern Cameroon to Francophone Cameroon for trial\nby military tribunals and that other victims were tried in civil law courts, without interpreters.\n122. The Respondent State admits that between 1997 and 2001, some individuals were transferred from\nthe North West Cameroon, and were tried for various criminal offences by the Yaoundé Military Tribunal.\nThese offences include unlawful incitement, disturbances of public peace, destruction of public property,\nassassination of gendarmes and civilian individuals, illegal possession of weapons and ammunition and the\nillegal declaration of the independence of Anglophone Cameroon on 30 December 1999.\n123. The Respondent States asserts the following: \"[a]ware that in the past the actions of SCNC militants\nhave always ended up in assassinations, kidnapping of persons, destruction and setting ablaze of public\nbuildings, public authorities could not remain indifferent in front of this manifest determination to cause\ndisorder and disturbances. About three days before 1 October 2001, gendarmes were dispatched nearly\neverywhere in the areas and localities targeted by the SCNC.\"\n124. The Respondent State submitted that some of the victims were released, albeit after prolonged\nperiods of detention, for lack of evidence. Others were released on bail, and fled the country. It argues that\nthe prolonged detention was due to administrative bottlenecks, which are a constant concern of the\ngovernment. The Respondent State did not indicate the measures it had taken to address the chronic\nadministrative problems causing prolonged detentions.\n125. The Respondent State denied that it ignored or failed to implement Court decisions in Anglophone\nCameroon. It cited a number court decisions it had complied with, including those which overturned\nexecutive decisions. The Complainant did not give any specific case or decision which was not complied\nwith by the Respondent State.\n126. The Commission wishes to state that the rights outlined in Article 7 constitute fundamental tenets of\nany democratic state. It is through respect for these rights that other rights guaranteed by the Charter may\nalso be realised. The Commission has adopted the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Fair Trial and\nLegal Assistance in Africa, to assist State Parties to better guarantee the rights enshrined in Article 7.\n127. The Respondent State did not explain why it transferred individuals from North West Cameroon for\ntrial by the Yaoundé and Bafoussam Military Tribunals, nor the reason why the victims were tried by\ntribunals outside the jurisdictions where the offences were allegedly committed. The Commission has\nstated previously that trial by military courts does not per se constitute a violation of the right to be tried by a\ncompetent organ. What poses [a] problem is the fact that, very often, the military tribunals are an extension\nof the executive, rather than the judiciary. Military tribunals are not intended to try civilians. They are\nestablished to try military personnel under laws and regulations which govern the military. In\ncommunication 218/98 Civil Liberties Organisation, Legal Defence Centre, Legal Defence and Assistance\nProject v. Nigeria the Commission stated the following: \"The military tribunals are not negated by the mere\nfact of being presided over by military officers. The critical factor is whether the process is fair, just and\nimpartial\"14\n128. The accused persons were not military personnel. The offences alleged to have been committed were\nquite capable of being tried by normal courts, within the jurisdictional areas the offences were allegedly\ncommitted. The Commission finds that trying civilians by the Yaoundé and the Bafoussam Military Tribunals\nwas a violation of Article 7(1)(b) of the Charter.\n129. The Complaints submit that the accused were tried in a language they did not understand, without the\nhelp of interpreters. The Respondent State did not contradict that allegation. The Commission states that it\nis a prerequisite of the right to a fair trial, for a person to be tried in a language he understands, otherwise\nthe right to defence is clearly hampered. A person put in such a situation cannot adequately prepare his\ndefence, since he would not understand what he is being accused of, nor would he apprehend the legal\narguments mounted against him.15 The aforementioned Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair\nTrial and Legal Assistance in Africa, states that one of the essential elements of a fair hearing is: \"...an\nentitlement to the assistance of an interpreter if he or she cannot understand or speak the language used in\nor by the judicial body.\" 16\n130. The Commission recognises that the Respondent State is a bilingual country. Its institutions including\nthe judiciary can use either French or English. However since not all the citizens are fluent in both\nlanguages, it is the State's duty to make sure that, when a trial is conducted in a language that the accused\n12\n\n\fdoes not speak, he/she is provided with the assistance of an interpreter. Failing to do that amounts to a\nviolation of the right to a fair trial.\n131. The Commission therefore concludes that the Respondent State violated Articles 7(1)(b), 7(1)(c) and\n7(1)(d) of the Charter.\n\nAlleged violation of Article 9\n\n132. The communication alleges violation of Article 9 of the Charter. The Complainants did not make any\nsubmissions concerning Article 9. The Commission has therefore not made any finding regarding Article 9.\n\nAlleged violation of Article 10\n\n133. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State violated Article 10 of the African Charter. The\nparties did not make any submission on Article 10 of the Charter. The Commission finds no violation of\nArticle 10.\n\nAlleged violation of Article 11\n\n134. The Commission examined whether Article 11 was violated. The Commission deems that there is\nenough information on the record, based on the both parties to enable the Commission to make its\ndetermination.\n135. Article 11 states that: \"Every individual shall have the right to assemble freely with others. The\nexercise of this right shall be subject only to necessary restrictions provided for by law in particular those\nenacted in the interest of national security, the safety of others, health, ethics and rights and freedoms of\nothers.\"\n136. The facts before the Commission depict cases of suppression of demonstrations, including the use of\nforce against, the arrest and detention of people taking part in such demonstrations. The Commission has\nheld previously that: \"...the Charter must be interpreted holistically and all clauses must reinforce each\nother.\" 17\n137. The Complainant states that several victims were arrested and held in detention for long periods, for\nexercising their right to freedom of assembly. Some of the detained persons were acquitted. There were\nothers who died at the hands of security forces or in detention, after being accused of participation in\n\"unlawful political rallies.\" The victims who died, or had been detained suffered while exercising their\nexercise of the right to freedom of assembly.\n138. The Commission does not condone unlawful acts by individuals or organisations to advance political\nobjectives, because such actions or their consequences are likely to violate the African Charter. It\nencourages individuals and organisations, when exercising their right to freedom of assembly, to operate\nwithin the national legal framework. This requirement does not absolve States Parties from their duty to\nguarantee the rights to freedom of assembly, while maintaining law and order. The Respondent States\nadmits that it detained demonstrators, applied excessive force to enforce law and order, and in some cases\nlives were lost. The Commission concludes therefore that Article 11 of the African Charter was violated.\n\nAlleged violation of Article 12\n\n139. The Complainants alleged that Article 12 was violated by the Respondent State. They did not\nsubstantiate any infringement by the Respondent State of the right to freedom of movement. The\nCommission finds no violation of Article 12.\n\n13\n\n\fAlleged violation of Article 13\n\n140. The Complainants alleged violation of Article 13. They stated that the people of Southern Cameroon\nwere not adequately represented in the institutions of the Republic of Cameroon except for \"token\"\nappointments. They allege further that the Respondent State manipulated demographic data to deny\nSouthern Cameroonians equal representation in government.\n141. The Respondent State submitted that, upon the introduction of multi-partyism in 1992, many Southern\nCameroonian opposition parties, such as the Social Democratic Front (SDF), have participated in\nmunicipal, legislative and presidential elections. Opposition parties control several councils and are\nrepresented in the National Assembly. It argues that access to high office is open to all citizens without\ndistinction. The Respondent State accused the Complainants of bad faith, and stated that some of the\nhighest positions in the Republic had been held by Southern Cameroonians. It accuses SCNC and SCAPO\nof persecuting fellow Anglophones who refuse to adhere to the secession agenda.\n142. The Complainants claim that Southern Cameroonians have since 1961 been accorded only 20 %\nrepresentation in the Federal/National Assembly instead of the 22% they think they deserve. The\nComplainants' main complaint is the ratio of representation, rather than the non representation. The\nRespondent State states that 20% representation cannot be said to be \"tokenism\".\n143. The Commission is inclined to agree with the Respondent State. It finds that in spite of the alleged\ndisproportionate percentage, Southern Cameroonians were representation [sic], and hence participated in\npublic affairs of the Respondent State as required under Article 13 of the African Charter.\n144. The Commission states that it is not sufficient for the Complainants to assert in general terms that a\ncertain category of citizens were denied the right to access public positions or that they were\nunder-represented in government or public administration. The Complainants did not furnish the\nCommission with information or cases that individuals in Southern Cameroon were denied representation\nor denied access to public services. The Commission finds that allegations concerning \"tokenism\" have not\nbeen substantiated and concludes that there is no violation of Article 13.\n\nAlleged violation of Article 17\n\n145. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State violated Article 17 of the Charter, because it is\ndestroying education in the Southern Cameroons by underfunding and understaffing primary education.\nThat it imposed inappropriate reform of secondary and technical education. It discriminates Southern\nCameroonians in the admission into the Polytechnique in Yaoundé, and refused to grant authorisation for\nregistration of the Bamenda University of Science and Technology, thereby violating Article 17 on the right\nto education.\n146. The Respondent State denied that it is destroying the education system in the Southern Cameroon. It\nprovided detailed data and statistics on the measures it had taken to carter for the education sector in the\nSouthern Cameroons. It stated that in certain cases it had provided more resources to Southern Cameroon\nthan it had done for other regions. The Complainants contested the reliability of the data and statistics, but\ndid not convince the Commission that the data should not be relied upon.\n147. Regarding the alleged discrimination concerning admission of Southern Cameroonians into the\nPolytechnique in Yaounde, the Respondent State argued that admission to the National Advanced School\nof Engineering is based on merit, as is the case with all higher institutions of learning. It stated that the\nSchool has trained a number of civil engineers from both the Anglophone and Francophone parts.\n148. Concerning the alleged refusal to grant authorisation for the registration of the Bamenda University of\nScience and Technology, the Respondent State stated that the said university did not fulfill conditions for\nestablishment of private universities. The Complainant did not show whether the criteria were met by the\nBamenda University of Science and Technology or not. The Commission reiterates that for it to make\nfinding on any allegations, the Parties have to provide it with the necessary information. Rule 119 of the\nRules of Procedure of the Commission, (which govern this communication) require parties to furnish\nexplanation or statements, including additional information.\n149. The Complainants should have done so under Rule 119 (3) of the Rules of Procedure. The\nCommission allowed Parties to make oral submission in this particular case. The Complainants did not\nsubstantiate the allegations. For the above reasons, the African Commissions finds that there is no violation\n14\n\n\fof Article 17(1) of the Charter.\n150. The Commission then examined the alleged violation of Articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23(1) and 24 of the\nAfrican Charter.\n\nAlleged violation of Article 19\n\n151. The Complainants premised the complaint alleging violation of their collective rights on the events\nwhich happened prior to 18 December 1989. The Commission has already expressed itself on the question\nof its jurisdiction rationae temporis. The Complainants alleged that the Respondent State, \"forcefully and\nunlawfully annexed\" Southern Cameroon. They argue that the Respondent State: \"........established its\ncolonial rule there, complete with its structures, and its administrative, military and police personnel,\napplying a system and operating in a language alien to the Southern Cameroon, ... and continues to\nexercise a colonial sovereignty over Southern Cameroon to this day.\"\n152. They argue further that: \"... the occupation and assumption of a colonial sovereignty over Southern\nCameroon by the Respondent State amounts to violation of Articles 19 and 20 of the African Charter....,\nboth of which outlaw domination, and colonialism in all its forms and manifestations. Article 19 places an\nabsolute ban on the domination of one people by another. Article 20 emphatically asserts the right of every\npeople to existence, to self determination, and of resistance to colonialism or oppression by resorting to any\ninternationally recognised means of resistance\"\n153. These are very serious allegations which go to the root of the statehood and sovereignty of the\nRepublic of Cameroon. The Respondent State responded by arguing that the Commission is:\n\"...incompetent to handle the issue of the process of decolonisation that took place in this State and under\nthe auspices of the United Nations.\"\n154. Respondent State submits further that the Commission cannot examine or adjudicate on the 1961 UN\nplebiscite, on events which took place between the October 1961 and 1972, when the Federal and Union\nConstitutions were adopted, because they predated the entry into force of the Charter.\n155. The Commission concedes that it is not competent to adjudicate on the legality of those events, due to\nlimitation imposed on its jurisdiction rationae temporis, for reasons stated hereinabove. The Commission\ncannot make a finding on allegations made by the Complainants concerning \"illegal and forced annexation,\nor colonial occupation of Southern Cameroon by the Respondent State,\" since they fall outside its\njurisdiction rationae temporis.\n156. The Commission states, however that, if the Complainants can establish that any violation committed\nbefore 18 December 1989, continued thereafter, then the Commission shall have competence to examine\nit.\n157. The Complainants alleged cases of economic marginalisation, and denial of basic infrastructure by the\nRespondent State, as constituting violations of Article 19. They allege that these violations were a\nconsequence of the events of 1961 and 1972, and continued after 18 December 1989.\n158. The Respondent State contested the allegation of economic marginalisation. It submitted documents\nand statistics in support of its provision of basic infrastructure in Southern Cameroon. The statistical\ninformation and data show that, for the period 1998 up to 2003/4, the North West and South West\nprovinces, (Southern Cameroon,) were allocated substantially higher budgetary resources, than the\nFrancophone provinces, for the construction and maintenance of roads, and running of education training\ninstitutions. The documents show that the situation in the Anglophone regions is not that different from\nother parts of the country. It argued that the problem concerning inadequate infrastructural development is\nnot peculiar to Southern Cameroon.\n159. The Complainants rejected as adulterated the data and statistics provided by the Respondent. The\nComplainants did not furnish any document to support their allegation. The Commission finds no reason\nwhy it should not rely on the data and statistics provided by the Respondent State in its decision. The\nCommission holds that the Respondent State allocated public resources to the Anglophone provinces\nwithout discrimination.\n160. The Respondent State did not however respond specifically to the allegations concerning the\nrelocation of major economic projects and enterprises from Southern Cameroon. It explained the reason for\nrelocating the seaport to Douala from Limbe, otherwise known as Victoria. It argues that, Douala being the\ngateway into Cameroon, the government needed to monitor the movement of persons and good for evident\n15\n\n\fsecurity reasons and efficient customs control.\n161. Every State has an obligation under international law to preserve the integrity of its entire territory. The\nmaintenance of security and movements of persons and goods on the territory is part of that obligation. The\nargument by the Respondent State that it could not guarantee the security of persons and goods at Limbe,\nunless it moved the port, is tantamount to acknowledging that it had no control of Limbe. The Commission\nbelieves that the security and customs authorities could have effectively monitored the movement of\npersons and goods, even if the seaport had continued to be at Limbe.\n162. The Commission states that the relocation of business enterprises and location of economic projects\nto Francophone Cameroon, which generated negative effects on the economic life of Southern Cameroon\nconstituted violation of Article 19 of the Charter.\nAlleged violation of Article 20\n\n163. The Complainants state that the \"alleged unlawful and forced annexation and colonial occupation\" of\nSouthern Cameroon by the Respondent State constituted a violation of Article 20 of the Charter. They claim\nthat Southern Cameroonians are entitled to exercise the rights to self determination under Article 20 of the\nCharter as a separate and distinct people from the people of \"La Republique du Cameroon.\" Article 20\nstipulates that: 1. All peoples shall have the right to existence. They shall have the unquestionable and\ninalienable right to self determination. They shall freely determine their political status and shall pursue their\neconomic and social development according to the policy they have freely chosen.\n2. Colonised or oppressed peoples shall have the right to free themselves from the bonds of domination by\nresorting to any means recognised by the international community.\n3. All peoples shall have the right to the assistance of the states parties to the present Charter in their\nliberation struggle against foreign domination, be it political, economic or cultural.\n164. The Complainants submit that the UN plebiscite was premised on certain conditions, including the\nconvening of a conference of equal representative delegations from the Republic of Cameroon and\nSouthern Cameroon to work out the conditions for the transfer of sovereign powers to the future federation.\nIt is further submitted that such arrangements should have been approved by the separate parliaments of\nthe Republic of Cameroon and Southern Cameroon before sovereignty was transferred to a single entity\nrepresenting both sides. The Complainants submit that the results of the plebiscite were never submitted to\nthe parliament of the Southern Cameroon for approval.\n165. The Respondent State did not respond to the allegations concerning \"unlawful annexation and\ncolonialism.\" It submitted instead that the issues are incapable of adjudication by the Commission on\naccount of its lack of jurisdiction.\n166. The Respondent State contested further the claim that Southern Cameroonians are a \"separate and\ndistinct people\" . The Commission shall examine this issue.\n167. The Complainants reiterate that their \"separate and distinct\" identity is based on the British\nadministration over Southern Cameroon. They submit that they speak the English language, and apply the\ncommon law legal tradition, as opposed to the Francophone zone, where French is spoken and the civil law\nsystem is applicable.\n168. The Respondent State submitted that it does not dispute the basic historical facts concerning the Trust\nadministration, but denies that Southern Cameroonians exist as a \"people.\" It states the following; \"[t]he\ncomplainants raise in order to shore up this assertion the use of the English language (working language),\nthe specificity of the legal system, of the educational system, of the system of government, traditional\ncultures. In fact, the specificities of former Southern Cameroons stem solely from the heritage of British\nadministration and the legacy of Anglo-Saxon culture. No ethno-anthropological argument can be put\nforward to determine the existence of a people of Southern Cameroons, the Southern part being of the\nlarge Sawa cultural area, the northern part being part of the Grass fields' cultural area. Since 1961,\nalthough some specificities had been preserved on more than one aspect, there had been remarkable\nrapprochement at the administrative and legal levels. The 'separate and distinct people' thesis is no longer\nvalid today.\"\n169. The Commission shall clarify its understanding of \"peoples' rights\" under the African Charter. The\nCommission is aware the controversial nature of the issue, due to the political connotation that it carries.\nThat controversy is as old as the Charter. The drafters of the Charter refrained deliberately from defining\n16\n\n\fit.18 To date, the concept has not been defined under international law. However, there is recognition that\ncertain objective features attributable to a collective of individuals, may warrant them to be considered as\n\"people\".\n170. A group of international law experts commissioned by UNESCO to reflect on the concept of \"people\"\nconcluded that where a group of people manifest some of the following characteristics; a common historical\ntradition, a racial or ethnic identity, cultural homogeneity, linguistic unity, religious and ideological affinities,\nterritorial connection, and a common economic life, it may be considered to be a \"people\". Such a group\nmay also identify itself as a people, by virtue of their consciousness that they are a people.19 This\ncharacterisation does not bind the Commission but can only be used as a guide.\n171. In the context of the African Charter, the notion of \"people\" is closely related to collective rights.\nCollective rights enumerated under Articles 19 to 24 of the Charter can be exercised by a people, bound\ntogether by their historical, traditional, racial, ethnic, cultural, linguistic, religious, ideological, geographical,\neconomic identities and affinities, or other bonds.\n172. The drafters of the Charter provided for the protection of \"peoples rights\" under the Charter. In his\nbook, entitled; The Law of the African (Banjul) Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, Justice Hassan B.\nJallow,20 an eminent African Jurist, who participated in the drafting the African Charter, sheds light on this\nissue. He says that: \"[t]he concept of peoples' rights, to which a whole chapter had been devoted in the\ndraft did not mean there was any grading of rights. There were economic, social and cultural rights which\nhave particular importance to developing countries and which together with civil rights and political rights in\none complementary whole should henceforth be given an important place.\"21\n173. Justice Jallow cites the late President Leopold Sedar Senghor, the first President of Senegal and an\neminent African Statesman, who told the inaugural meeting of African Legal Experts to draft the Charter,\nthe following: \"People will perhaps expatiate for a long time upon the 'People Rights' we were very keen on\nreferring [sic] to. We simply meant, by so doing, to show our attachment to economic, social, and cultural\nrights, to collective rights in general, rights which have a particular importance in our situation of a\ndeveloping country. We are certainly not drawing lines of demarcation between the different categories of\nrights. We want to show essentially that beside civil and political rights, economic, social and cultural rights\nshould henceforth be given the important place they deserve. We wanted to lay emphasis on the right to\ndevelopment and the other rights which need the solidarity of our States to be fully met; the right to peace\nand security, the right to a healthy environment, right to participate in the equitable share of the common\nheritage of mankind, the right to enjoy a fair international economic order and, finally the right to natural\nwealth and resources.\" 22\n174. The African Commission has itself dealt with the issues of peoples' rights without defining the term\n\"people\" or \"peoples' rights\". In its acclaimed Report of the Working Group of Experts on Indigenous\nPopulations/Communities,23 the African Commission described its dilemma of defining the concepts in the\nfollowing terms: \"[d]espite its mandate to interpret all provisions of the African Charter as per Article 45(3),\nthe African Commission initially shied away from interpreting the concept of 'peoples'. The African Charter\nitself does not define the concept. Initially the African Commission did not feel at ease in developing rights\nwhere there was little concrete international jurisprudence. The ICCPR and the ICESR do not define\n'peoples'. It is evident that the drafters of the African Charter intended to distinguish between the traditional\nindividual rights where the sections preceding Article 17 make reference to \"every individual\". Article 18\nserves as a break by referring to the family. Articles 19-24 make specific reference to \"all peoples.\"\n175. It continues: \"Given such specificity, it is surprising that the African Charter fails to define \"peoples\"\nunless it was trusted that its meaning could be discerned from the prevailing international instruments and\nnorms. Two conclusions can be drawn from this. One, that the African Charter seeks to make provision for\ngroup or collective rights, that is, that set of rights that can conceivably be enjoyed only in a collective\nmanner like the right to self determination or independence or sovereignty...\".24\n176. The Commission deduces from the foregoing discourse that peoples' rights are equally important as\nare individual rights. They deserve, and must be given protection. The minimum that can be said of\npeoples' rights is that, each member of the group carries with him/her the individual rights into the group, on\ntop of what the group enjoys in its collectivity, i.e. common rights which benefit the community such as the\nright to development, peace, security, a healthy environment, self determination and the right to equitable\nshare of their resources.\n177. It is in the light of the above that the Commission shall examine the allegations against the\nRespondent State, concerning the violations of the collective rights cited hereinabove.\n\n17\n\n\f178. The Commission states that after thorough analysis of the arguments and literature, it finds that the\npeople of Southern Cameroon can legitimately claim to be a \"people\". Besides the individual rights due to\nSouthern Cameroon[ians], they have a distinct identity which attracts certain collective rights. The\nUNESCO Group of Experts report referred to hereinabove, states that for a collective of individuals to\nconstitute a >\n\n18\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"8","date":"May 27, 2009","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"Torture and ill treatment, Arrest and detention, Right to fair trial, Right to information, Freedom of association, Freedom of assembly, Right to participate in government, Right to self-determination, Extrajudicial executions, Right to life, Discrimination, Independence of the judiciary, Equality and equal protection before the law, Right to education","activity_report":"26th Activity Report: Dec 2008 – May 2009","outcome":"4"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080b2643","title":"Interights (on behalf of Safia Yakubu Husaini et al) ","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559138369,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"269_03 INTERIGHTS (on behalf of Safia Yakubu Husaini et al) _ Nigeria.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463559139157fisiq6afo6qadcxr.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463559139157fisiq6afo6qadcxr.pdf","size":15379},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"269/03 INTERIGHTS (on behalf of Safia Yakubu Husaini\net al) / Nigeria\nSummary of Facts\n1. The complaint is filed by INTERIGHTS on behalf of Safiya Yakubu Husaini and others who have been\nallegedly subjected to gross and systematic violations of fair trial and due process rights in the Sharia\nCourts in Nigeria.\n2. The Complainant alleges that Ms Safiya Hussaini, a Nigerian woman and nursing mother was sentenced\nto death by stoning by a Sharia Court in Gwadabawa, Sokoto State, Nigeria, for an alleged crime of\nadultery, which sentence was the latest in a series of serious and massive violations of the right to fair trial\nand associated guarantees.\n3. The Complainant alleges that Safiya's case is only one of the many cases to be decided under the\nrecently introduced pieces of Sharia penal legislation in northern Nigerian States. All laws in Nigeria, at\nboth Federal and State levels, ought to be compatible with both the [C]onstitution of 1999 and international\n(including regional) treaties ratified by Nigeria, and are required to particularly comply with the African\nCharter which is domestic law in the country.\n4. In its complaints, the Complainant also enumerates other similar instances of alleged violations of fair\ntrial, personal dignity and the right to life. It alleged that in December 2002, a Ms Hafsatu Abubakar from\nSokoto State was charged with 'zina', which is either voluntary premarital sexual intercourse or, if the\nperson is married, to [sic] adultery.\n5. On 19th January 2001, an unmarried woman called Bariya Magazu received 100 lashes in Zamfara State\nfor having committed the offence of 'zina'[i]. Ms Magazu was also initially convicted of false accusation for\nfailing to prove her declaration that three particular men had coerced her into having sexual intercourse,\nwhich men were not prosecuted. By an order of an Islamic Court in the same State, a Mr Umaru Bubeh\nreceived 80 strokes of the cane on 9th March 2001 for drinking alcohol. On 4th May 2001, a Mr Lawal\nIncitara's hand was amputated after a [i]Sharia Court in same state found him guilty of stealing bicycles.\n6. In Sokoto State, Sani Shehu and Garga Dandare were sentenced to have their right hands and left feet\namputated after being convicted by a Sharia Court in Sokoto State on 20th December 2001. On 27th\nDecember 2001, the Upper Sharia Court in the same State convicted a Mr Aminu Bello of theft and\nsentenced him to have his right hand amputated.\n7. The Complainant alleges that in none of these cases did the victims/accused persons receive, nor were\nthey offered, competent or any legal representation. The rights of legal representation in the Sharia Courts\nare very limited and, even where they allow legal representation, only lawyers who are Muslims can\npractice in them.\n8. It is further alleged that the new Sharia penal legislations that are adopted in the various Nigeria States\ncontain specifications that limit their application to people of Muslim faith but they dispense with all the fair\ntrial safeguards recognised in the African Charter. Moreover, unlike in other criminal cases where accused\npersons are able to appeal to the Nigerian Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the country,\nappeals in the Sharia criminal cases end before the special Sharia Courts of Appeal. In effect, the Sharia\npenal legislation subjects persons of Muslim faith to lower standards of fair trial merely by reason of their\nfaith. In all the cases regarding the application of Sharia law for criminal cases, there is discrimination on\ngrounds of the faith of the accused.\n9. The complaint also alleges that the rights of those tried under Sharia law are protected to a lesser extent\nthan in the Penal Code for Northern Nigeria, valid for non-Muslim people, particularly concerning the right\nof representation, the right of appeal and the lack of knowledge of criminal procedure by the court. Under\nSharia law, the death penalty is applied for offences that are not punishable with the death penalty under\nthe Penal Code for Northern Nigeria. The criteria [sic] for appointing judges to the same court also fails\nshort of international standards of training judicial personnel, and there is no requirement for judges to be\nlegally qualified in law.\n10. Together with its complaint, the Complainant submitted a request for provisional measures to the\nAfrican Commission in accordance with Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\n\n1\n\n\fComplaint\n11. The Complainant alleges serious and massive violations of Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 26 of the African\nCharter.\n\nProcedure\n12. The complaint was dated 30th January 2002 and received at the Secretariat on 31st January 2002.\n13. On 5th February 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the Complainant\nacknowledging receipt of the complaint, and requesting the latter to forward the relevant information and\nevidentiary materials on the developments surrounding the application of the Penal Provisions of Sharia\nreligious law before Nigerian Sharia Courts, and to forward to it complete and specific cases of alleged\nirregularities supported by relevant documentations. The Complainant was also asked to indicate to the\n[African] Commission which of the specific decisions of the Sharia Courts had been executed, and which\nwere pending.\n14. On 6th February 2002, the Chairman of the African Commission addressed an urgent appeal to His\nExcellency, President Olusegun Obasanjo of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, respectfully urging him to\nsuspend further implementation of the Sharia penal statutes and decisions as well as convictions thereof,\nincluding the case of Ms Safiya Yakubu, pending the outcome of the consideration of the complaints before\nthe African Commission.\n15. On the same date, the Chairman of the African Commission addressed a similar Urgent Appeal to His\nExcellency Amara Essy of the African Union, respectfully urging Him to draw the attention of the President\nof the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the [African] Commission's requests, and to positively respond thereof.\n16. On 8th February 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission faxed a copy of the Chairman's Urgent\nAppeal to the High Commission of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Banjul, The Gambia for onward\ntransmission of the same to His Excellency, President Olusegun Obasanjo of the Federal Republic of\nNigeria.\n17. On 3rd March 2002, the Complainant wrote to the Secretariat informing the latter that it will assemble as\nmany of the documents as exist and would get back to the Secretariat on its progress.\n18. On 7th March 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the Complainant confirming\nreceipt of the same and reminding the latter that it would be awaiting for [sic] the relevant information.\n19. On 19th March 2002, the Director of the Political Affairs Department of the African Union wrote to the\nChairman of the African Commission that the Secretary General of the African Union had formally taken up\nthe matter at the level of H.E. Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The\nSecretariat of the African Commission brought the same to the attention of the Chairman.\n20. On 21st March 2002, the Chief of Staff to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria wrote, on\nbehalf of H. E. President Olusegun Obasanjo, to the Chairman of the African Commission acknowledging\nreceipt of the Urgent Appeal and assuring him that the administration and many Nigerians equally shared\nhis concern. The letter further expressed his optimism that, in the long run, justice would be done and\nSafiya??s life would be spared. While noting that the Federal Government could not unilaterally suspend\nthe Sharia Penal Statutes and decisions which were within the prerogative of the State government in\naccordance with the Nigerian Constitution, the letter assured the Chairman that the Administration would\nleave no stone unturned in ensuring that the right to life and human dignity of Safiya, and that of all other\nNigerians that may be affected in future were adequately protected.\n21. On 2nd April 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the Complainant reminding it of\nthe need for further information on Ms Amina Lawal who was alleged to have been sentenced to a similar\npunishment by a Sharia Court in Katsina State. While informing the same of the pledge by the Nigerian\nAdministration regarding the case of Safiya and the follow up by the AU Secretary General, the Secretariat\nreminded the Complainant that it still awaited for the submission of the documentation and information as\nrequested in its previous letters.\n22. On 19th April 2002, the Political Affairs Department of the African Union wrote to the Secretariat of the\nAfrican Commission informing the latter of the decision by the Federal Court of Appeal in Nigeria\noverturning the death sentence imposed on Safiya by a lower Court in Sokoto State thereby making the\nneed to make further Presidential intervention unnecessary.\n23. During the 31st Ordinary Session held in Pretoria, South Africa in May 2002, the Complainant orally\ninformed the Secretariat that it was trying to compile the relevant information on the complaint and that it\n2\n\n\fwould be best if the Secretariat waited for the same before further action on complaint.\n24. On 27th August 2002, the Secretariat received a letter from the International Commission of Jurists [ICJ]\nexpressing its concern in the fate of Ms Amina Lawal and her child.\n25. By a letter of 27th August 2002, the Secretariat informed the ICJ that the African Commission was\nfollowing the developments in Nigeria regarding the application of Sharia Penal Statutes in the country,\nincluding and particularly, the case of Ms Lawal, through the appropriate channels.\n26. During the 32nd Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia in October 2002, the Complainant orally\ninformed the Secretariat that it was unable to compile the requested information in time, that it was in touch\nwith its local partners in Nigeria on the case and suggested the [African] Commission went ahead in dealing\nwith the complaint.\n27. During the intersession period before the 33rd Ordinary Session, the Secretariat called the Complainant\nto inquire about the progress it made and on the status of the cases pending before national courts.\n28. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held in Niamey, Niger from 15 to 29 May 2003, the African Commission\nexamined the complaint and decided to be seized thereof.\n29. On 12th June 2003, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainants and Respondent State informing them of\nthis decision and requested them to forward their written submissions on admissibility before the 34th\nOrdinary Session of the [African] Commission. A similar letter of reminder was sent out to the parties on 6th\nAugust 2003 and on 17th October 2003.\n31. At its 34th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 6th to 20th November 2003, the African\nCommission examined the complaint and decided to defer its consideration on admissibility to the 35th\nOrdinary Session.\n32. On 9th December 2003, the Secretariat wrote to the parties informing them of this decision and further\nrequesting them to forward to the African Commission their written submissions on the admissibility of the\ncommunication before the 35th Ordinary Session. The same was copied to the Respondent State's High\nCommission in Banjul, The Gambia.\n33. The Secretariat sent a similar reminder to both parties on 29th April 2004 to send their written\nsubmissions on the admissibility of the communication before the 35th Ordinary Session.\n34. At its 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 21st May to 4th June 2004, the African\nCommission examined the complaint and decided to defer its consideration on admissibility to the 36th\nOrdinary Session.\n35. At the same Ordinary Session, a copy of the complaint was handed over [to] the Nigerian Delegation.\n36. On 17th June 2004, the Secretariat wrote to the parties informing them of this decision and further\nrequesting them to forward to the African Commission their written submissions on the admissibility of the\ncommunication before the 36th Ordinary Session. The same was copied to the Respondent State's High\nCommission in Banjul, The Gambia.\n37. The Secretariat sent a similar reminder to both parties on 7th September 2004 to send their written\nsubmissions on the admissibility of the communication before the 36th Ordinary Session.\n38. During the 36th Ordinary Session held in Dakar, Senegal from 23rd November to 7th December 2004,\nthe Complainant orally informed the Rapporteur of the communication of his [sic] wish to withdraw the case.\n39. At the same Ordinary Session, the African Commission decided to defer its decision on the request for\nwithdrawal to the 37th Ordinary Session, pending a written confirmation of the same by the Complainant.\n40. On 23rd December 2004, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainant and Respondent State informing\nthem of this decision and requesting the former to forward its written request for withdrawal before the 37th\nOrdinary Session of the [African] Commission.\n41. A similar reminder was sent to the Complainant on 2nd February and 4th Apri1 200[4].\n42. During its 37th Ordinary Session held from 27th April to 11th May 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nAfrican Commission received a written request for withdrawal from the Complainant dated 2nd May 2005.\n\nHolding\n\nFor the abovementioned reason, the African Commission takes note of the withdrawal of the\ncommunication by the Complainant and decides to close the file.\nAdopted by the African Commission at its 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from\n3\n\n\f27th April to 11th May 2005.\n\n4\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"36","date":"May 11, 2005","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"","keywords":"Equality and equal protection before the law, Torture and ill treatment, Liberty of the person, Right to fair trial","activity_report":"18th Activity Report (Tripoli) : Jan 2005 - Jul 2005","outcome":"20"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080b2ea3","title":"Association of Victims of Post Electoral Violence & Interights","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559138390,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"272_03 Association of Victims of Post Electoral Violence & INTERIGHTS _ Cameroon.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463559139385swcoqjiperjjdcxr.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463559139385swcoqjiperjjdcxr.pdf","size":95718},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"272/03 Association of Victims of Post Electoral\nViolence & INTERIGHTS / Cameroon\n272/03 Association of Victims of Post Electoral Violence & INTERIGHTS v Cameroon\n\nSummary of the Facts\n1. The communication had been initiated against the Republic of Cameroon, State Party1 to the African\nCharter, by two Non Governmental Organisations (NGO); The Association of the Victims of Post Electoral\nViolence of 1992 of the North West Region, headquartered in Bamenda, Cameroon; and The International\nCentre for the Legal Protection of Human Rights (INTERIGHTS)2 , headquartered in London, UK.\n2. In the communication, the complainants contend that on the 23rd October 1992, in reaction to the\nconfirmation by the Supreme Court of Cameroon of the victory of the candidate Paul Biya of the Cameroon\nPeoples' Democratic Party (CPDM) in the presidential elections of the 11th October 1992, the members of\nthe Social Democratic Front (SDF), the Principal Opposition Party, attacked the symbols of the State and\nthe militants of the Party which won the elections, in the city of Bamenda, their Party stronghold.\n3. Property belonging to CPDM militants and to other citizens are said to have been destroyed. The\ndamages caused to Messrs. Albert Cho Ngafor and Joseph Ncho Adu are estimated at one billion CFA\nfrancs for each of them. Damages to the tune of 800 million CFA francs are said to have been caused to\nabout a hundred other individuals.\n4. Certain victims such as Mr. Albert Cho Ngafor, who had been sprayed with petrol, were moreover\nsubjected to serious physical attacks.\n5. In consequence the Cameroonian Authorities arrested certain individuals presumed to be responsible for\nthese events; the said Authorities also set up, in February 1993, a Committee responsible for the\ncompensation of the victims.\n6. However, having waited in vain for their compensation, the victims of the post electoral violence of\nBamenda organised themselves into an Association and embarked on certain activities in order to have the\nmatter settled amicably.\n7. This method however proved fruitless, as, in spite of firm promises made by the President of the\nRepublic, who had been approached in the context of the measures taken towards an amicable settlement,\nno concrete result had been obtained by the victims of the violence.\n8. On the 13th March 1998, the victims of the Bamenda events brought an appeal for responsibility against\nthe Cameroonian State to the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court. The appeal in question had\nbeen recorded on the 22nd April 1998 by the Clerk of Courts, under the number 835/97-98.\n9. On the 16th July 1998, the Government of Cameroon reacted, requesting the Supreme Court to declare\nthe victims' submission inadmissible and since then, the proceedings have been blocked in spite of all the\nefforts made by the Counsels of the complainants, with the support of certain administrative Authorities, like\nthe Commissioner of the District of Mezam (home region of the victims).\n\nThe Complaint\n10. The complainants allege the violation of Articles 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 of the African Charter by the Republic\nof Cameroon. In consequence, the complainants are requesting the African Commission to:\n• Declare the refusal by the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Cameroon to consider\ntheir appeal against the Government of Cameroon as contrary to the principles of the right to a fair\nhearing, as stipulated by the African Charter in its Article 7 and by the relevant provisions of other\ninternational human rights instruments;\n• Note that the Government of Cameroon has not respected its obligation to protect the physical\nintegrity (Article 4) and property (Article 14) of individuals living on its territory or under its\njurisdiction;\n• Request the Government of Cameroon to pay full compensation for the damages suffered by the\nvictims of the post electoral violence in Bamenda;\n\n1\n\n\f• Request the Government of Cameroon to enact positive legislation to ensure the fair, equitable and\nrapid compensation for the victims of human rights violations and to ascertain that the human rights\nviolations committed in Bamenda do not happen again in Cameroon.\n\nProcedure\n11. The communication which was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on the 04/04/2003\nhad been registered under N° 272/2003, for consideration by the African Commission at its 33 rd Ordinary\nSession (15-29 May, in Niamey, Niger).\n12. By letter ACHPR/COMM/2 of the 15th April 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission\nacknowledged receipt of the Communication to the Complainants.\n13. During its 33rd Ordinary Session, the African Commission examined the complaint and decided to be\nseized of it. Consideration of its admissibility was deferred to its 34th Ordinary Session scheduled to be held\nfrom the 7th to 21st October 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia.\n14. By letter and by Note Verbale of the 27th June 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission\ninformed both the complainants and the Respondent State of the decision of the African Commission.\n15. On the 5th August 2003, the Secretariat received a memorandum from the complainants on the\nadmissibility of the complaint and conveyed it to the Respondent State by Note Verbale dated 6th August\n2003, whilst reminding it to convey its own memorandum to the Secretariat as early as possible.\n16. By Note Verbale of the 14th October 2003, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cameroon\nrequested additional information and more time for it to prepare its memorandum on the admissibility of the\ncase.\n17. By letter of the 17th October 2003, the Secretariat contacted the complainants requesting them to\nprovide the supplementary information required by the Respondent State. The complainants complied\nwithout delay and the request of the Respondent State was met on the 30th October 2003.\n18. During its 34th Ordinary Session which was held from the 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The\nGambia, the African Commission examined the complaint and heard the Parties. Sequel to this, the African\nCommission deferred its decision on admissibility of the case to its 35th Ordinary Session.\n19. By Note Verbale and by letter of the 16th and 17th December 2003 respectively, the Secretariat of the\nAfrican Commission informed the Parties reminding the Respondent State that its memorandum on\nadmissibility was still outstanding.\n20. By letter dated 16th March 2004, and received at the Secretariat of the Commission on the 18th March\n2004, the complainants conveyed a letter transmitting additional arguments in response to the oral\narguments made by Respondent State at the 34th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 6th to\n20th November 2003.\n21. On the 19th March 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission sent a Note Verbale to the\nRespondent State reminding it to send its comments on the admissibility of the complaint.\n22. By Note Verbale dated 6th April 2004 and received at the Secretariat of the African Commission, the\nRespondent State, referring to the Note Verbale sent to it on the 16th December 2003, informed the\nSecretariat that the case of which the African Commission had been seized and which opposed it to the\ncomplainants, was still pending before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Cameroon\nwhich had deferred the said case to the 26th May 2004.\n23. During its 35th Ordinary Session which was held in May/June 2004 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission examined the Complaint and heard the Parties on the admissibility of the case. On this\noccasion, the Respondent State submitted in writing, its memorandum on the admissibility of the case to\nthe Secretariat of the African Commission, which in turn had conveyed it to the complainant party by letter\ndated 17th November 2004.\n24. During its 36th Ordinary Session, which was held in November/December 2004 in Dakar, Senegal, the\nAfrican Commission considered the complaint and declared it admissible.\n25. By letters dated 20th December 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission notified this decision to\nthe Parties and requested their arguments on the merits of the case as early as possible.\n26. On 30th March 2005, the arguments of the Respondent State on the merits of the communication had\nbeen received at the Secretariat of the African Commission through a Note Verbale dated 16th March 2005.\n2\n\n\f27. On 14th April 2005, the Secretariat of the Commission acknowledged receipt of the memorandum from\nthe Respondent State on the merits of the communication and on that same date, conveyed it to the\ncomplainant party for reaction.\n28. On 3rd October 2005, the complainant sent its rejoinder to the observations of the Respondent State on\nthe merits of the complaint by letter dated 26th September 2005. On the 13th October 2005, the Secretariat\nacknowledged receipt of the letter.\n29. On 30th November 2005, this document had been forwarded against a receipt of acknowledgement, to\nthe delegation of the Respondent State attending the 38th Ordinary Session of the Commission.\n30. During this same Session (21st November - 5th December 2005, Banjul, The Gambia), the African\nCommission examined the complaint and in the absence of any reaction from the Respondent State to the\narguments of the complainant party on the merits of the case, differed its decision at this point to its 39th\nOrdinary Session.\n31. On 7th December 2005, this decision was notified to the Parties and the Respondent State, in particular\nhad been invited to send its reaction on the submissions of the complainant within 3 months.\n32. In the absence of any reaction from the Respondent State, a reminder had been sent to it on the 23rd\nMarch 2006.\n33. By Note Verbale dated 29th March 2006, and received by the Secretariat of the African Commission on\nthe 13th April 2006, the Respondent State conveyed its reaction on the arguments submitted by the\ncomplainant party on the merits of the case.\n34. The Secretariat transmitted these arguments to the complainant party on the 8th May 2006.\n35. In a Note Verbale dated 30th June 2006 and a letter also dated 30th June 2006, the Parties had been\nrespectively informed that during its 39th Ordinary Session, the African Commission had decided to defer\nthe case to its 40th Ordinary Session scheduled for the 15th to 29th November 2006 in Banjul, The Gambia.\n36. On the 4th October 2006, the Secretariat of the commission received a memorandum from the\ncomplainant party in rejoinder to the arguments on the merits formulated by the Respondent State to the\ncommunication.\n37. During its 40th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from the 15th to 29th November 2006, the\nAfrican Commission decided to defer the case to its 41st Ordinary Session scheduled for the 16th to 30th\nMay 2007 in Accra, Ghana for a ruling on the merits of the case.\n38. In a Note Verbale dated 31st January 2007 and a letter also dated 31st January 2007, the Parties were\ninformed about the deferment of the case to the 41st Ordinary Session of the African Commission\nscheduled for the 16th to 30th May 2007 in Accra, Ghana.\n39. During its 41st Ordinary Session held in Accra, Ghana, the African Commission had deferred the\ncommunication to its 42nd Ordinary Session for a decision on the merits of the case.\n40. By Note Verbale dated 15th June 2007 and a letter dated the same day, the Parties to the\ncommunication had been informed of the deferment of the case to the 42nd Ordinary Session of the\nCommission scheduled for the 14th to 28th November 2007 in Brazzaville, Congo.\n41. In a Note Verbale dated 11th September 2007 a letter had been sent to the Respondent State\nreminding it of the deferment of the communication to the 42nd Ordinary Session.\n42. By letter dated 13th September 2007, the complainant party had been reminded about the deferment of\nthe communication to the 42nd Ordinary Session.\n43. The Parties had been respectively informed in a Note Verbale and a letter dated 19th December 2007\nabout the deferment of the examination of the decision on the merits to the 43rd Ordinary Session of the\nCommission to be held from 15th to 29th May 2008 in Ezulwini, in the Kingdom of Swaziland.\n44. In a Note Verbale dated 18th March 2008 and a letter dated 20th March 2008, the Parties had been\nreminded of the deferment of the case to the 43rd Ordinary Session of the Commission. The Parties had\nhowever been informed of the change of dates of the said Session the holding of which had been brought\nforward to the 7th to 22nd May 2008 instead of from 15th to 29th May as had been initially announced.\n45. In a Note Verbale dated 24th October 2008, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State about the\ndeferment of consideration on the decision on the merits of the communication to the 44th Ordinary Session\nscheduled for the 10th to 24th November 2008 in Abuja, Nigeria.\n46. During the same period of the 24th October 2008, the complainants had been informed by letter of the\ndeferment of the communication for examination on the merits to the 44th Ordinary Session of the African\nCommission.\n47. After the examination of the communication at the 44th Ordinary Session held in Abuja in the Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria, the African Commission deferred the reexamination to the 45th Ordinary Session\n3\n\n\fscheduled for the 13th to 27th May 2009 in Banjul, the Gambia for the consideration of the new\ndevelopments in the area of international law.\n48. In a Note Verbale dated 21st December 2008 and a letter dated the same day, the Secretariat informed\nthe Parties to the communication about the deferment of the case to the 45th Ordinary Session scheduled\nfor 13th to 27th May 2009. In addition by note Verbale dated 23rd April 2009 and a letter dated the same\nday, a reminder was sent to the parties.\n49. The parties to the communication were informed that the matter was deferred to the 46th Ordinary\nSession of the Commission scheduled to be held in Banjul, The Gambia from 11th-25th November 2009 in a\nNote Verbale and a letter both dated June 11th, 2009.\n\nThe Law\nAdmissibility\n50. The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights stipulates in its Article 56 that the communications\nreferred to in Article 55 should necessarily, in order to be considered, be sent after all local remedies have\nbeen exhausted, if they exist, unless the procedure of exhaustion of local remedies is unduly prolonged.\n51. In this instance, the complainant, while admitting that the case is still under consideration by the legal\nAuthorities of the Respondent State who had been seized of it, contends that the procedures are unduly\nprolonged and that under these conditions the requirement that local remedies be exhausted as stipulated\nby Article 56 of the African Charter, cannot apply.\nArguments of the Complainant Party on the admissibility of the case\n\n52. In support of his argument, the complainant contends, in his memorandum on admissibility dated 05th\nAugust 2003, that the complaint had been deposited with the African Commission five years after the same\ncomplaint against Cameroon had been brought before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of\nthis State, and which has, to date, remained without any response.\n53. In the memorandum cited earlier, the complainant further contends that the alleged victims of the\ncomplaint had made several fruitless submissions for an out-of-court settlement to the administrative and\npolitical Authorities of the Respondent State. The alleged victims had then brought an appeal for liability\nagainst the State of Cameroon before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court on the 13th March\n1998. The latter conveyed its statement on defence to the complainants on the 12th August 1998. Since\nthat date and in spite of the reaction of the complainants (27th August 1998) and the numerous reminders,\nthe complainants did not receive any more information relating to the case from the Administrative\nChamber of the Supreme Court, and this despite the national3 procedural legislation which stipulates that\nonce the exchange of arguments is completed, the case files should be closed in the 5 months that follow.\n5 years have passed without any reaction from the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court.\n54. It is for this reason, pleads the complainant, that although local remedies are available, they do not <<\nat all respond to the imperative of efficacy which is their raison d'?tre>>. The complainant adds that the\nAdministrative Chamber of the Supreme Court is familiar with this type of practices, which is why\nCameroon had been condemned by the African Commission 4 (for a case which had remained pending for\n12 years before the Yaoundé Court of Appeal) as well as by the United Nations Human Rights\nCommission5 (for a case which had remained pending before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme\nCourt for more than 4 years).\n55. During a hearing at the 34th Ordinary Session of the African Commission, the complainant party had\nreiterated these arguments insisting on the fact that the bringing of this case before the African Commission\nhad contributed a lot to the revival of the case by the Cameroon legal Authorities after all these years of\ninaction.\n56. In its memorandum with supplementary information on admissibility, dated 18th March 2004, the\ncomplainant recalled that the Respondent State had been condemned by the African Commission and by\nthe United Nations Human Rights Commission for the slowness of its justice system. These delays, which\ncannot be attributed to Cameroon's underdevelopment, but rather, according to the complainant, << to the\ninefficiency of the Cameroonian national Authorities, both legal and administrative >> are not only contrary\nto the African Charter but also to the principles of the right to a fair hearing adopted by the African\nCommission.\n4\n\n\f57. The complainant further reiterates that the violation, according to him, by the Administrative Chamber of\nthe Supreme Court, of the regulations which stipulate that once the exchanges of memoranda are\ncompleted, the latter should close the case file within 5 months, as since August 1998, the complainants\nhad not received any news from the said Chamber in spite of several reminders and, according to the\ncomplainants, despite the fact that the Judges of this Court were << perfectly aware of the implications of\nthis procedure for the complainants >>.\n58. The complainant party moreover denounces the attitude of the powers that be, who had made promises\nwhich never culminated in results, but above all the shortcomings of the Cameroonian Authorities exposed\nby the mal-functioning of the Commission responsible for compensating the victims of the violence (placed\nunder the Prime Minister's Office), which had been created in the context of the effort to find an amicable\nsolution to the problem. This Commission, declares the complainant, had been one of the local remedies\nopen to the victims. But 12 years after its creation and 11 years after having heard the victims, this\nCommission had still not submitted its report. There again, concludes the complainant, the delay is unduly\nprolonged. The complainant therefore implores the African Commission to declare the complaint\nadmissible.\nArguments of the Respondent State on the admissibility of the case\n\n59. The Respondent State had for its part pleaded, during the hearing before the African Commission at its\n34th Ordinary Session, that the delays observed in the administration of justice in Cameroon are due to the\nunder developed nature of the country, which does not have the means to provide all the facilities required\nfor a diligent justice system, and not to a deliberate desire by the Government to hinder the administration\nof justice.\n60. The Respondent State again reiterated this point during a hearing by the African Commission at its 35th\nOrdinary Session. In its memorandum on admissibility submitted on this occasion, the Respondent State\npleads that the complaint is still under consideration before one of the highest national Courts which,\ncertainly has a lot of backlog in its work, but which is aware of the situation and that the Parties require that\nthe case be concluded by the national legal Authorities. Thus, on the 25th February and the 31st March\n2004, the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court held two ordinary sessions. The debate on the\ncase in question, scheduled for the 31st March 2004 had been postponed to the 26th May 2004 on the\nrequest of the Counsel for the complainants.\n61. The Respondent State further pointed out that for these reasons, the Complainant should not speak of\nabnormally long delays in the Cameroonian justice system, particularly where the << current delay is not\nattributable to the Court in charge of the case but rather to the Complainant Party itself >>.\n62. In consequence, the Respondent State requests the African Commission to declare the communication\ninadmissible.\nAnalysis of the African Commission on the admissibility\n\n63. The African Commission considers that the complainant party, before appearing before it had started to\nuse the remedies available at the local level. The procedure before the Administrative Chamber of the\nSupreme Court had lasted 5 years without any feedback for the complainants, contrary to the regulations in\nforce and in spite of the numerous reminders which had been sent to the said Court. The African\nCommission therefore considers that the delay on the part of the Court in the treatment of the case was\nunduly prolonged.\n64. Pertaining to the Compensation Commission set up under the Prime Minister's Office, its operations\nwere highly inefficient as 12 years after its creation and 11 years after hearing the victims, it had not\npublished its report. There also, the African Commission considers that this ad hoc Commission, whose\nestablishment was aimed at achieving an amicable settlement of the case, had registered excessive delays\nin its operations.\n65. The Respondent State pleads that the legal authorities remain aware of the case at the national level\nbut the African Commission considers the delays by the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of\nCameroon excessive.\n66. The African Commission further notes that re-introduction of the proceedings on the case before the\nAdministrative Chamber of the Supreme Court in February 2004, namely after a gap of 5 years, only took\nplace after the submission of a Complaint (to the African Commission), by the victims in April 2003 and\nafter the decision on seizure taken by the Commission on the said complaint in May 2003 (33rd Ordinary\n5\n\n\fSession), as well as the hearing of the Parties to the case in November 2003 during its 34th Ordinary\nSession. This leads the African Commission to presume that the re-introduction of the proceedings was not\naccidental but rather it was due to the action brought by the victims before the African Commission.\n67. The African Commission considers that State Parties have an obligation to administer, on their territory,\nclear and diligent justice in order to give satisfaction to the complainants in the shortest possible time, in\nconformity with the relevant provisions of the African Charter and with the directives and principles of the\nright to a fair hearing in Africa.\n68. In this particular case, the Commission notes that for 5 years, the Administrative Chamber of the\nSupreme Court of the Respondent State had not provided any reaction to the complainants, in spite of\nseveral appeals by the latter. The Respondent State has admitted this fact but attributes it to lack of\nresources. Consideration of the case has indeed recommenced a short while ago, but one can reasonably\nconclude that this consideration was largely due to the seizure of the African Commission by the victims.\nWhereas this should not be the case, that is, justice to be administered by State Parties should not wait for\nthe African Commission to be seized of a matter before it is rendered fully, clearly and diligently. This had\nnot been the case with the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of the Respondent State.\n69. Concerning the Compensation Commission, an ad hoc institution meant to solve the problem amicably\nat the national level, has shown its limitations in failing to produce any Report after twelve years of\nexistence. The Respondent State does not refute these allegations, which allows one to believe that they\nare true. The African Commission therefore considers that this remedy is neither effective nor satisfactory.\n70. For these reasons, the African Commission declares the Communication admissible.\nThe Merits\n71. Pursuant to Rule 120 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission, once a communication\nwhich is submitted under the terms of Article 55 of the Charter has been declared admissible, the\nCommission << examines it in the light of all the information which the complainant and the Respondent\nState concerned have submitted in writing, and it renders its observations on the subject >>.\n72. It appears from the case file that parties have made their conclusions on the merits of the case since\n30th March 2005, and that the information provided by the Parties to the Communication and added to the\ncase file is sufficient to allow a ruling on the merits of the case.\nSubmissions of the complainants on the merit\n\n73. The complainants are requesting the African Commission to declare the State of Cameroon in violation\nof the relevant provisions of the African Charter and in particular of Articles 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 of the said\nCharter and, in consequence, to declare the State of Cameroon bound to pay compensation for the\nprejudices sustained by the victims of the post electoral events of 1992.\n74. The Commission is consequently obliged to examine the alleged violations on the basis of the facts and\nthe law.\nOn the violation of Article 1 of the African Charter\n\n75. Under the terms of Article 1 of the African Charter, << the OAU Member States, Parties to the present\nCharter, recognize the rights, responsibilities and freedoms enunciated in this Charter and undertake to\nadopt legislative and other measures for their application>>.\nArguments of the complainants pertaining to the violation of Article 1 of the African Charter\n\n76. From the point of view of the violation of Article 1, the complainants contend:\ni. That the African Charter sets out in its Article 1 a general obligation on the protection of rights. In this\ncontext, like << the majority of the human rights treaties, besides requiring the States Parties to abstain\nfrom all violation or unauthorized restriction of the rights it proclaims, compels them to take positive\nmeasures to guarantee the widest possible protection of the individuals under their jurisdiction >>.\nii. That if the recognition referred to by Article 1 of the Charter << bestows them universality6 , to the\nguaranteed rights, the taking of appropriate measures allows them to assume real effectiveness >>. That\nthe Commission has had the opportunity to underscore this aspect during the examination of a case on the\n6\n\n\factivities of a petroleum consortium in Southern Nigeria by re-affirming that the African Charter was\ncreating a certain number of obligations for the States Parties which include, in particular, << the\nresponsibility of respecting, protecting, promoting and implementing 7 >> the rights which it sets out before\nspecifying that << the Governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens, not only by adopting\nappropriate legislation and by applying them effectively, but also by protecting the said citizens from\nharmful activities which can be perpetrated by private parties. This responsibility requires positive action on\ntheir part >>.\niii. That the interpretation by the Commission of Article 1 of the African Charter can be compared with that\nof the United Nations Human Rights Commission on Article 2\n×\n1.

That the Commission had to judge that the refusal or the negligence of the\n• Authorities of a State Party to protect journalists and human rights activists against\n• repeated attacks (harassment, arbitrary arrests, assassination, torture) by the security forces and\nunidentified groups, constitutes (d) a violation of the said Charter even if this State or its officers are\n(were) not the direct perpetrators of this violation>>.\n11\n\nv. That the present communication provides the Commission with the opportunity to a. clarify the meaning\nand scope of the << positive actions >> that the States are required to carry out in order to conform with the\nconditions of the African Charter, and this, by responding to the affirmation made by the Cameroonian\nAuthorities and according to which the implementation of << all the legal, technical, human and material\nmeans at their disposal to control the post-electoral events of Bamenda in 1992 frees them from the\nobligation of means which is incumbent upon them >>.\nvi. That the African Charter really and truly imposes an obligation of result and not one of diligence on the\nStates Parties, of guaranteeing to the victims of the October 1992 events the enjoyment and effective\nexercise of the rights which it proclaims and the lack of respect for which gives rise to a right to\ncompensation for the victims or their dependents and implies, for the Cameroonian State, the responsibility\nto compensate and the freedom to act against the perpetrator or perpetrators of the violation.\nvii. That, in effect, where, the Commission has not had numerous opportunities to make a ruling on the\nexact content of Articles 1 of the Charter12 , it has nonetheless pointed out that this Article is the basis of\nthe rights recognized by the African Charter in so far as it confers on it << the legally binding nature which\nis generally attributed to international Treaties of this nature and that any violation of one of its provisions\nwould automatically represent a violation of Article 1>>.13\n\nPertaining to the violation of Articles 2, 4, 7 and 14 of the African Charter\n\n77. Concerning the violation of Articles 2, 4, 7 and 14 the complainants appear to link it to the importance\nthat Article 1 represents in the present case, since according to the complainants, Article 1 is << the only\none which defines the scope of the legal obligations contracted by the States Parties to the Charter,\nthereby allowing correct interpretation of the obligations contained in the other provisions of the Continental\nTreaty >>. Thus, the complainants contend that if taken in isolation, Article 1 of the Charter commits the\nState Parties to taking all the necessary legislative measures allowing the effective protection of the rights\nand liberties contained in the Charter, that is to say, of averting or at least of minimizing all risks of violating\nthe exercise or enjoyment of these rights, and in combination with the other relevant provisions of the\nCharter, the obligation of averting violations imposes on the States Parties the obligations of:\n• Taking preventive measures;\n• Taking measures so that the enjoyment and exercise of the rights are not hindered by measures of\nseizure14 or of expropriation which are not dictated by the satisfaction of a general interest or a\npublic necessity or even the looting or the destruction of the property of natural persons or legal\nentities;\n• Putting in place legislation which makes it possible to avert, repress and punish violations to life, but\nalso << to take preventive measures of a practical nature to protect the individual whose life is\nthreatened by the actions of another>>.15\n\n78. Thus, the complainants contend :\n8\n\n\f1.\n2. That the above mentioned articles had been violated by the State of Cameroon since the latter had\nfailed in its obligation to take adequate preventive measures if not to avert or prevent the events in\nquestion, at least to reduce them to zero. To support this reasoning, the complainants emphasize\nthat the Cameroonian authorities knew that the Bamenda events were going to take place and that\nseveral personalities had spoken of threats coming from the Social Democratic Front (SDF) against\nthe security of people and property in the Province.\n3. That the Prime Minister at the time, Mr. Achidi Achu had alluded to the said threats.\n4. in the campaign speech he made on the 6th October 199216 in Kumbo in the North-West Province.\nThe said threats had been later mentioned by the Minister of Communication and Government\nSpokes-person in a press briefing on the political situation of the country during which he had\nspoken of the existence of a provisional arsenal of the SDF estimated at 300 pistols and 60 combat\n17 weapons. Furthermore, in the interview granted to the national Daily the Cameroon Tribune, the\nSecretary General of the ruling CPDM Party, had unveiled << the diabolical plan>> concocted at the\nbeginning of the month of October by the Opposition to take over power18 . Moreover, direct threats\nhaving been made against all those who support the ruling party, several complaints received by the\nGovernor of the North West province brought by citizens wishing to obtain Government protection\ntestify to the fact that the territorial Administrative Authorities had been informed about the SDF's\nplans.\n5. That despite these early warning signs, the Government of Cameroon, in neglecting to take\nadequate measures to prevent the events of October 1992 from taking place, thereby violated, even\npassively, the obligation of prevention contained in Article 1 of the African Charter. The State of\nCameroon has neither brought the perpetrators of these atrocities to justice, nor paid compensation\nfor the damages suffered by the victims whose right to an effective remedy has been violated.\n6. That in consequence, the Commission should request the Cameroonian Authorities, in conformity\nwith its own jurisprudence19 , to pay compensation in view of the long delay by the Justice\nAdministration in examining the Complainants' case. In conclusion, the Commission is being\nrequested to reject the arguments of the Cameroonian Government, to take note of the violation of\nArticles 1, 4, 7 and 14 of the African Charter; to request the Government of Cameroon to institute\nproceedings against the perpetrators of the atrocities committed between the 23rd and 27th October\n1992; to determine, on the basis of the evidence presented, the amount of compensation to be paid\nto the victims based on all the damages suffered by the latter. The Complainants further request the\nCommission to ask the State of Cameroon to amend the laws which are incompatible with the\nprovisions of the African Charter and to fix a deadline for the State of Cameroon relative to the\napplication of any decision that the Commission may take on this matter.\n\nThe essence of the arguments of the respondent state in relation to the violation of Articles 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 of the African\nCharter\n\n79. The Respondent State for its part, argues that the violations being alluded to by the complainants are\ncompletely groundless since the State of Cameroon has not, in this particular case, deprived any of the\ncomplainants of the right to respect for his life and physical integrity nor his right to property. The State of\nCameroon took measures to save the life and property of individuals during what can be called the\nBamenda events.\n80. Furthermore, the Respondent State intimates that this particular case happened in the context of the\nyears called democratic agitation during which Cameroon had experienced a certain amount of agitation\ndue to the return to a multiparty system and to individual liberties. That for this reason, from May 1990 to\nDecember 1992, and due to the organization of two major elections, the legislative then the presidential,\npublic law and order had been disrupted throughout the country thereby giving rise to a large loss of life,\nand important material damage.\n9\n\n\f81. According to the Respondent State, the specific case of Bamenda, which was of major proportions took\nplace between the 23rd and 30th October 1992, and was marked notably by the difficulty of the State to\nmaintain law and order. The Respondent State further contends that in the case of Bamenda, the\nimplementation of the mandate to protect people and property by using the forces of law and order had\nbeen reinforced after the 23rd October 1992, date on which the results of the presidential elections were\nproclaimed. Thus, about 548 men had been deployed in the region of Bamenda with motor vehicles and\nother vehicles for the maintenance of law and order and equipment adapted to deal with the situation on\nthe ground. However, although the post electoral disturbances had taken place in other parts of the\nterritory, these incidents had been extraordinarily violent in Bamenda where they took the form of a\ngeneralized insurrection and had been instigated by the militants of an Opposition Party, the Social\nDemocratic Front (SDF).\n82. Moreover, the Respondent State contends that::\n1.\n2. Following the destruction, a joint Gendarmerie-Police-Justice Commission had been set up and\ngiven the responsibility for carrying out investigations on all suspects who had been arrested.\nHowever, the individuals who were given heavy charges and had been brought before the State\nsecurity Court had later been released on the persistent request of the human rights defender\norganizations.\n3. That it happened that the State of Cameroon, having steadfastly implemented the legal, technical,\nhuman and material resources at its disposal to contain the post electoral events of Bamenda in\n1992, it was thus freed from the obligation of diligence which was its responsibility. The extent of the\nevents in question having the character of force majeure was such that they could not be attributed\nto the State of Cameroon.\n4. That in view of the full compensation being demanded by the complainants, it should be recalled\nthat the responsibility of the State of Cameroon could not be established in either the unexpected\nhappening of the Bamenda events, or in their management. Consequently, it would be extremely\ndifficult to pay compensation since there is no law which authorizes this sort of payment particularly\nwhere the State is not the perpetrator in any way.\n5. That in relation to the enactment of a law allowing the payment of fair and equitable compensation\nto the victims of the human rights violations in Cameroon, following the unexpected happening of\nthe events in question, the following institutions had been successively put in place:\n♦\n♦ An organization for political dialogue at the national level called the Tripartite and comprising\nthe State, Civil Society and the Political Parties. This Tripartite had made possible the\nrealization of the constitutional amendments of 18th January 1996.\n♦ A Committee then a National Human Rights and Liberties Commission;\n♦ A National Elections Observatory and the strengthening of the National Communications\nCouncil.\n\n6. That taking all these matters into consideration and with all the proper reservations, the African\nCommission should declare the present communication baseless.\n\nAnalysis of the Commission with regard to the nature and scope of the obligation conatained in Article 1 of the African\nCharter\n\n83. It follows from the arguments of the facts and the law presented by the complainant party and\nresponded to by the Respondent Party, that the nature and the scope of the obligation contained in Article\n1 of the African Charter constitute a matter of special importance in the present communication. Thus,\n10\n\n\faccording to the complainant party, Article 1 of the African Charter imposes an obligation on the States\nParties to take measures which can produce concrete results. Whereas it can be inferred from the\narguments submitted by the Respondent Party that the provisions of Article 1 of the African Charter impose\nan obligation of diligence on the States Parties.\n84. It is therefore up to the African Commission to clarify the nature and scope of this article. It is evident\nthat the legal aspect raised by the argument of the two parties present before the African Commission\nrelates to the question whether Article 1 of the African Charter imposes an obligation of diligence or an\nobligation of result vis-?-vis the States Parties to the said Charter. In other words, did the States Parties to\nthe African Charter make the commitment of taking measures which should give certain results by virtue of\nArticle 1?\n85. In view of the importance of this question of law, and the importance which the complainant party\nappears to give Article 1, the African Commission should, in the present communication, determine the\nlegal nature of the obligation which the afore-mentioned Article imposes on States Parties.\nThe extent or the scope of the obligation contained in Article 1 of the Charter\n\n86. Concerning the scope or the extent of the obligation imposed by Article 1 of the African Charter, it is\nimportant to point out that it had been clarified sui generis20 , (in a distinctive manner) and that the\nCommission's jurisprudence is abundant enough in this area.\n87. Thus, according to the Commission's jurisprudence, Article 1 confers on the Charter the legally binding\ncharacter generally attributed to international Treaties of this nature. The responsibility of the State Party is\nestablished by virtue of Article 1 of the Charter in case of the violation of any of the provisions of the\nCharter. Article 1 places the States Parties under the obligation of respecting, protecting, promoting and\nimplementing the rights.\n88. The respect for the rights imposes on the State the negative obligation of doing nothing to violate the\nsaid rights. The protection targets the positive obligation of the State to guarantee that private individuals\ndo not violate these rights. In this context, the Commission ruled that the negligence of a State to guarantee\nthe protection of the rights of the Charter having given rise to a violation of the said rights constitutes a\nviolation of the rights of the Charter which would be attributable to this State, even where it is established\nthat the State itself or its officials are not directly responsible for such violations but have been perpetrated\nby private21 individuals.\n89. According to the permanent jurisprudence of the Commission, Article 1 imposes restrictions on the\nauthority of the State Institutions in relation to the recognized rights. This Article places on the State Parties\nthe positive obligation of preventing and punishing the violation by private individuals of the rights\nprescribed by the Charter. Thus any illegal act carried out by an individual against the rights guaranteed\nand not directly attributable to the State can constitute, as had been indicated earlier, a cause of\ninternational responsibility of the State, not because it has itself committed the act in question, but because\nit has failed to exercise the conscientiousness required to prevent it from happening and for not having\nbeen able to take the appropriate measures to pay compensation for the prejudice suffered by the victims22\n.\n90. In this context of prevention, the State should carry out investigations so as to detect the various risks\nof violence and take the necessary preventive measures. The problem here does not concern so much the\nacts violating the rights but rather of knowing whether the State took the tangible measures to prevent the\nimminent risks of perpetration of the said acts. It is not a question of inculpating the State for its lack of\nconscientiousness regarding any act perpetrated in relation to the guaranteed rights but of knowing\nwhether the State, considering the imminent risks of serious violations, used due diligence that was\nrequired. Under the terms of comparative law, it is the position that was taken by the Inter-American Human\nRights Court in the Vélasquez Rodriguez case in the following terms:\n91. \"an illegal act which violates human rights and which is initially not directly imputable to a state (for\nexample because it is the act of a private person or because the person responsible has not been\nidentified) can lead to the international responsibility of State, not because of the act itself, but because of\nthe absence of due diligence to prevent the violation or to respond to it as required by the convention.\"\n92. In the case Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum vrs. Zimbabwe, the Commission had indicated and ruled\nthat the doctrine of due diligence should be applied on a case by case basis.\n\n11\n\n\fOn the nature of the obligation contained in Article 1 of the Charter\n\n93. The scope of the State's general obligation to protect, sanctioned by Article 1 of the Charter having\nbeen clarified, it is therefore necessary to determine the nature of this obligation. Is it an obligation of\ndiligence or an obligation of result?\n94. Though by their origin, the obligation of diligence and the obligation of result emanate from the\ndomestic law systems, particularly from continental civil law, this term has also been frequently used in\ninternational law since the 20th century23 .\n95. The obligation of diligence consists, for a party to a contract, in placing at the disposal of the other party\nall the available resources without however guaranteeing the result that the said resources would produce.\nThus, in the context of this obligation, the debtor undertakes to deploy all efforts to provide the creditor with\na given requirement, but without being able to guarantee it. It is the case of the doctor who undertakes to\nprovide all the necessary care to his patient without however being able to guarantee the recovery of the\nsaid patient.\n96. The assertion of such a responsibility has the effect of compelling the party on whom reposes the\nobligation of diligence to pay compensation for the damages it may have caused in the execution of this\nobligation. This compensation takes the form of a conviction for the payment of damages with interest, that\nis to say an obligation to pay a sum of money. It is in this context that the notion of obligations arises, to\nwhich the Respondent State alludes in talking about its resources on the one hand and its corollary, the\nobligations of result, on the other.\n97. On the contrary, the obligation of result pre-supposes the commitment of the debtor to obtain a specific\nresult. Thus, in the context of this obligation, the transporter of a traveller undertakes to carry the passenger\nfrom point A to point B safe and sound.\n98. Pertaining to evidence, the evidence of a fault is only required from the complainant in the case of\nobligations of diligence since the complainant has to prove that the debtor has not deployed all the required\nefforts to obtain the success of the undertaking. On the other hand, the creditor of an obligation of result is\nexempted from providing such evidence. In effect, all he has to do is to establish that the promised result\nhas not been obtained; the debtor can only obtain release from his responsibility by establishing that the\nnon-execution is due to circumstances beyond his control which cannot be attributed to him but to force\nmajeure. The force majeure represents a foreign event which is both unforeseeable and uncontrollable\nwhich is at the root of an injury24\n99. Generally, in international law, the notion of obligation of diligence and that of result emanate from the\ninterpretation of Articles 20 and 21 of the draft articles of the International Law Commission (ILC) pertaining\nto the responsibilities of States. It must be noted that the comments from these two articles were adopted\nby the ILC which caused the latter to make a distinction between the violation of international obligations\nreferred to as \"behaviour\" or \"diligence\" and the violation of obligations otherwise called \" result\" 25\n100. Under Article 20 of the draft Articles of the ILC entitled \"Violation of an international obligation requiring\nthe adoption of a predetermined specific behaviour when the behaviour of the said State is at variance with\nthe behaviour specified under that obligation\".\n101. In respect of Article 21 of the draft ILC Articles which is entitled \"Violation of an international obligation\nrequiring the attainment of a specific result, the provision stipulates that: \"1) A State is in violation of an\nobligation requiting it to choose a determined result if by the behaviour exhibited, the State does not ensure\nthe realisation of the expected result required from it under the terms of that obligation. 2) If the behaviour\nof the State has created a situation that does not conform to the result required from it by the international\nobligation, but that it emerges from the obligation that this result or an equivalent result can all the same be\nachieved by the subsequent behaviour of the State, then a violation of the obligation occurs only when the\nState also fails by its subsequent behaviour to achieve the result expected from her by that obligation\".\n102. Thus, if the obligation of diligence requires that the State adopts specific behaviours or actions to\nattain specific results, then under obligation of result, the State enjoys the freedom of choice and action to\nachieve the result required by that obligation.\n103. Consequently, in the case Colozza vs Italy 26 , the European Court of Human Rights declared and\nrendered judgement that \" the contracting States (parties) enjoy very wide discretion in terms of the\ncalculation of the choices and means to ensure that their legal systems are in keeping with the provisions of\nArticle 6 paragraph 1 (Art 6-1) in this field. The task of the Court is not to indicate to the States these\nmeans, but to determine if the result required by the Convention had been achieved\".\n12\n\n\f104. Similarly, in the De Cubber vs Belgium27 , the European Court of Human Rights observed that its task\nwas to determine if the contracting States achieved the result required by the European Convention and\nthat its task was not to point out specifically the means used to arrive at that result.\n105. Moreover, in the judgement pronounced on January 19th, 2009 in the case relating to the request for\ninterpretation of the judgement of March 31st, 2004, in the Avena case and other Mexican citizens (Mexico\nvs the United States of America28 , the International Court of Justice which had been seized by Mexico for\nthe interpretation of paragraph 153 of the aforementioned judgement as imposing on the United States of\nAmerica an obligation of result, maintained that \"It is true that the obligation enunciated in this paragraph is\nan obligation of result which should manifestly be enforced unconditionally\"29 .\n106. Thus, the question that arises generally is to appreciate, on the one hand, the ultimate purpose or\nobjective of the rights prescribed by the African Charter on Human and People's Rights and on the other\nhand, whether yes or no the obligation prescribed in Article 1 of the Charter seeks to attain a purpose, an\nobjective or to achieve a result through the provisions contained therein.\n107. In the view of the Commission, the distinction between the obligation of diligence and that of result\nshould not make one lose sight of the fact that , all obligations contained in a Treaty, Convention or a\nCharter seek to attain an objective, a purpose or a result. The Governments of the States Parties are linked\nto the people living on their territory by a social contract consisting of ensuring the security and\nguaranteeing the fundamental rights, including the right to life and respect for the physical and material\nintegrity of the citizens. Where the rights, responsibilities and freedoms recognized by the States Parties to\nthe Charter can hardly pose major problems, since these regulations are outlined in the Articles 2 to 29 of\nthe Charter and their recognition emanates from the will of the States themselves to ratify the Charter,\nnonetheless this recognition ensues from the commitment made by these States to take tangible measures\ncapable of implementing the provisions prescribed by the Charter.\n108. It is also important to clarify that the signature, acceptance and ratification by the States of the\nprovisions contained in the Charter, the preparation or the adoption of legal human rights instruments only\nconstitute, in themselves, the beginning of the indispensable exercise of promotion, protection and the\nreparation of human and peoples' rights. The practical implementation of these legal instruments through\nthe State Institutions endowed with creditor, material and human resources, is also of considerable\nimportance. It is not enough to make do with taking measures, these measures should also be\naccompanied with institutions that produce tangible results. Furthermore, the Periodic Report imposed on\nthe States Parties in the context of Article 62 of the African Charter is part of the procedure placed at the\ndisposal of the African Commission to verify the results obtained by the States regarding their commitment\nas outlined in Article 1 of the said Charter.\n109. Where it is true that the laws guaranteeing the rights and freedoms, those criminalizing the given facts\nand providing for penalties against the perpetrators of the said facts, as well as the State institutions which\nimplement these instruments use the resources at the disposal of the citizens, it is also true that the\ndecisions of the Courts and Tribunals made in relation to the violations of these rights and the results of the\nexecution of the said decisions, contribute to restoring the rights of the victims.\n110. It follows from the above that Article 1 of the African Charter imposes on the States Parties the\nobligation of using the necessary diligence to implement the provisions prescribed by the Charter since the\nsaid diligence has to evolve in relation to the time, space and circumstances, and has to be followed by\npractical action on the ground in order to produce concrete results. Thus, in its decision on Communication\n74/92, the Commission said that the Governments have the responsibility of protecting their citizens not\nonly through appropriate legislation and its effective enforcement but also by protecting them against\ninjurious acts which can be perpetrated by third parties.\n111. In fact, in the Commission's view, it is an obligation of RESULT that Article 1 of the African Charter\nimposes on the States Parties. In effect, each State has the obligation of guaranteeing the protection of the\nhuman rights written in the Charter by adopting not only the means that the Charter itself prescribes, in\nparticular \"all the necessary legislative measures for this purpose but in addition measures of their choice\nthat the Charter called for by Article 1 and it therefore defined as one of result\".\n112. In accordance with its traditional commitment to protect the rights guaranteed by the Charter, the State\nParty is obliged to ensure the effective protection of human rights through out its territory. If this obligation\nwere that of an obligation of diligence the guaranteeing of human rights would be the object of legal\ninsecurity liable to release the State Parties to the human rights protection instruments from any\nresponsibility of effective protection. It is in taking into account the compelling nature of the protection of\nhuman rights that the human rights instruments set up control institutions to ensure that the obligations\n13\n\n\fensuing from these instruments are effectively implemented.\nAnalysis of the Commission with regard to the application of the case in point\n\n113. The legal nature of the obligations outlined in the provisions of Article 1 of the Charter having been\nclarified, the specific question raised with regard to its application to the case in point is that of knowing\nwhether the State of Cameroon was held by an obligation of diligence or an obligation of result and whether\nthe circumstance of force majeure cited by the Respondent State is fulfilled in order to release the said\nState from its obligation.\n114. The Complainant contends that the State of Cameroon is bound by an obligation of result and\nconsequently is compelled to pay compensation for the injuries suffered by the victims of the 1992\npost-electoral events. The State of Cameroon on her part maintains that it was bound by an obligation of\ndiligence as the 1992 events were of an insurrectional character. They are akin to a situation of force\nmajeure which the means employed by the Government could not curtail. Consequently, the State of\nCameroon avers that it is free from any liability.\n115. Pertaining to the case in point, considering the definition of the legal nature indicated above, the\nCommission is of the view that the obligations which ensue from Article 1 impose on the State of Cameroon\nthe need to implement all the measures required to produce the result of protecting the individuals living on\nits territory. The use of the legal, technical, human and material resources that the State of Cameroon\nclaims to have did not produce the expected result, namely that of guaranteeing the protection of human\nrights. For the post electoral events which gave rise to serious violations against the lives and property of\nthe citizens would not have taken place if the State which, through its investigations knew or should have\nknown about the planning of the said events, had taken the necessary measures to prevent their\nhappening.\n116. The events in question having taken place the day after the announcement of the results of the\npresidential elections, the Authorities only acted four days after the exploding of the hostilities, which\npromoted the magnitude of the violence and the serious violations of human rights and destruction of\nproperty. It has been established that, under the circumstances, the Respondent State has failed in its\nobligation to protect, considering its lack of diligence and allowed the destruction of lives and property.\nFurthermore, by invoking the circumstances of force majeure to free itself from its responsibility, the State\nof Cameroon has implicitly shown that it had been held by an obligation of result in this particular case.\n117. In principle, the circumstance of force majeure which assumes the characters of unpredictability,\nirresistibility and imputability can be invoked if the conditions had been fulfilled at the time of the events. In\nthis case, the said characters of unpredictability, irresistibility and imputability required by a situation of\nforce majeure and which the Respondent Party is invoking cannot be applicable for, according to the\nRespondent State itself, disturbances of public law and order existed in the country since May 1990 and\nspecifically during the holding of the elections, and that moreover, the threats30 of the 11th, 18th, 19th and\n22nd October 1992 from the SDF, the Opposition Party and qualified by the Respondent State as << an\natmosphere of political intimidation and counter intimidation... >> , sufficiently prove the existence of early\nwarning signs of the events in question and consequently the predictability of the events.\n118. What is more, the Respondent State had manifested its control of the territory and therefore its ability\nto stand up to the perpetrators of the post electoral events, by instituting a state of siege a few days after\nthe events in question; had this state of siege been instituted earlier, the events in question would have at\nleast been reduced in scope if not entirely quelled.\n119. The obligations prescribed by the African Charter in its Article 1 impose on the States Parties (the\nState of Cameroon included) the need to put in place all measures liable to produce the result of preventing\nall violations of the African Charter over their entire territory. These are not only violations which could\nemanate from the State machinery itself or those from non State actors. The implementation of the legal ,\ntechnical, human and material means alluded to by the State of Cameroon should have, in principle,\nproduced the result of preventing the events in question since the said events were foreseeable; the said\nmeans should at least, have served to bring the perpetrators to justice, have them judged and sentenced in\naccordance with the law and restore the rights of the victims or their dependents after the said events had\ntaken place. This is an ? posteriori result which should have produced results considering the means\nchosen by the State of Cameroon itself\n120. Each State Party to the African Charter is responsible for the security of the people and property living\neverywhere on its territory. Having a character of erga omnes31 , such an obligation constitutes part of\n14\n\n\fthose which cover a particular interest for all the States Parties to the African Charter and for the entire\ninternational Community since it is recognized in both domestic and international law. Therefore, as\nunderscored by the Respondent State, if it cannot be directly responsible for the events, the State of\nCameroon cannot also extricate itself from its responsibility for the actions of others which are a result of its\nfailure to conform to the provisions prescribed by Article 1 of the African Charter and therefore of its\nobligation of RESULT .\n121. Consequently, in having failed to prevent the 1992 post electoral violence even though there were\nearly warning signs (evidently) of the events in question and not having obtained the intended results\nmentioned above, the State of Cameroon has failed in its obligation of Result imposed on it by Article 1 of\nthe African Charter, and that in consequence the Respondent State is hardly in a position to invoke the\ncircumstances of force majeure. It therefore follows that the victims and their dependents should have their\nrights restored in full.\nAnalysis of the Commission with regard to the violation of Articles 2, 4, 7 and 14 of the African Charter\n\n122. By invoking the violation of Articles 2 and 7 of the Charter, the Complainants wish to contest the\nfreezing of the petition by the victims pertaining to responsibility of the issue which has been pending\nbefore the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court since 1998, in order to obtain full compensation\nof the corporal and material damages suffered. For the Complainants this procedure constitutes a violation\nof the right to an effective remedy.\n123. Article 2 stipulates that: << Every individual has the right to enjoy the rights and freedoms recognized\nand guaranteed under the present Charter without distinction of any kind, such as race, ethnic group,\ncolour, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion, national or social origin, fortune, birth or other\nstatus >>.\n124. It appears that complainants drew the infringement of the enjoyment of their rights and freedoms\nhence the violation of Article 2 of the Charter, from the fact that the respondent State failed to take\nadequate measures to prevent the violence which led to the physical harm and material damage suffered\nby the victims.\n125. The African Commission is of the view that there is no doubt in the present case that the victims of the\npost elections violence suffered from damage which infringed the enjoyment of their rights. Respondent\nState did not debate the fact of harm being caused to the victims, but rather argued that the post election\nevents are act of God and therefore it is beyond the capability of the State of Cameroon which should not\nbe held liable\n126. The African Commission is therefore in the position to hold that the provisions of Article 2 of the\nAfrican Charter have been violated because the victims were enjoying their rights and freedoms when they\nwere attacked. Such attacks which infringed their rights and freedoms were made possible because the\nState of Cameroon failed to fulfill its obligation to protect which incumbent upon the State.\n127. Article 7 stipulates: << Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This right\ncomprises: [...] (d) the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial Court or Tribunal >>.\n128. The term << remedy >> refers to << any procedure by means of which one submits a constitutive act\nof an alleged violation of the [Charter] to an institution qualified in this respect, for the purpose of obtaining,\nas the case may be, a cessation of the act, its annulment, its amendment or compensation >>32 . Is\neffective the remedy which not only exists de facto, but also is accessible to the party concerned and is\nappropriate. The petition should be appropriate so as to allow the denunciation of the alleged violations and\nthe payment of appropriate compensation.\n129. However, the effectiveness of the remedy is not linked to the expected outcomes. Nonetheless, the\neffects in question should be of a nature to remedy the alleged violation, otherwise the effective character\nof the remedy disappears. Finally, there is need to specify that the right to effective remedy sanctions an\nobligation of diligence, for what is guaranteed is the existence of an appropriate remedy and not its\nfavourable result, but an unfavourable jurisprudence renders the remedy useless.\n130. Considering all of the foregoing, the Commission is of the view that the complainants did not benefit\nfrom the right to an effective remedy, for if it was established that the remedy was available and\nassessable, it should be noted that it had not been appropriate since the fact that it was frozen made it\nimpossible for the Court to make a ruling. The petition remained pending for more than 5 years before the\ncomplainants decided to seize the African Commission in 2003.\n15\n\n\f131. With regard to Articles 4 and 14, the complainants highlight the violations to the physical integrity and\nto the material damages suffered by the victims.\n132. Under the terms of Article 4, << Human beings are inviolable. Every human being shall be entitled to\nrespect for his life and the integrity of his person. No one may be arbitrarily deprived of this right >>.\n133. Article 14 provides that \"The right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be encroached upon in\nthe interest of public need or in the general interest of the community and in accordance with the provisions\nof appropriate laws.\"\n134. In the light of their arguments, it would appear that the Parties seem to agree on the effectiveness of\nthe violations to the lives of the victims and the considerable material damages which resulted from the\nviolence of the post-electoral events. The Government has shown this agreement by setting up a Rescue\nCommittee for the Victims, in conformity with the Law of 26th June 1964 which authorizes the State to\nprovide << assistance within the limits of the amounts provided for this purpose or constant assistance in\nany other form >>. The said Committee had evaluated the amount of damages - interest at five billion, eight\nhundred and eight million, three hundred and ten thousand, and eight hundred and eighty francs CFA (5\n808 310 880). From all appearances, the victims had not been entirely unprejudiced.\n135. The Respondent State observed in its arguments that it was not at all a compensation on its part but a\nshow of solidarity, because it is not directly responsible for the prejudices suffered by the victims, and that it\nwas an act by private individuals that the victims could bring to justice so as to have satisfaction with\nrespect to their grievances.\n136. The Commission is of the view that the responsibility of the Government has been established. It\ntherefore follows that the Government should pay compensation for the prejudices suffered. Despite the\nfact that the Government is denying it, it understood that it could not remain insensitive to its obligation to\npay fair compensation to the victims, for this reason it set up a Committee to assess the damages suffered\nby the Complainants.\n\nDecision of the Commission\n137. Based on the foregoing reasons, the African Commission Decides that:\n1. The provisions of Article 1 of the African Charter impose on States Parties an obligation of Result;\n2. The State of Cameroon failed in its general obligation as set forth and sanctioned under Article 1 of\nthe African Charter and consequently the State of Cameroon has an obligation of RESULT;\n3. Due to its obvious lack of diligence, the State of Cameroon is held responsible for the violation of\nArticles 2, 4, and 14 of the African Charter; and therefore, the State of Cameroon is responsible for\nthe acts of violence which took place on its territory which gave rise to human rights violations,\nwhether these acts had been committed by the State of Cameroon itself or by people other33 ; than\nthe State;\n4. The State of Cameroon had moreover violated the provisions of Article 7 of the same Charter;\n138. Recommends to the State of Cameroon to:\n\n1. Take all the necessary measures for guaranteeing the effective protection of human rights at all\ntimes, and everywhere both in times of peace and in times of war;\n2. Pursue its commitment to give fair and equitable compensation to the victims and without delay, to\npay fair and equitable compensation for the prejudices suffered by the victims or their beneficiaries;\n3. That the amount of compensation for the damages and interest be fixed in accordance with\napplicable laws;\n\nDone in Banjul, The Gambia at the 46th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and\nPeoples' Rights held from 11th-25th November 2009.\n\n16\n\n\fFootnotes\n1 Cameroon ratified the Charter on 26th June 1989.\n2 INTERIGHTS enjoys observer status with the African Commission.\n3 Cf.

The Court recalls that the [popup=first sentence of Article 2 § 1]Everyone's right to life shall be\nprotected by law.\nenjoins the State not only to refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life, but also to take\nappropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction (see the L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom\njudgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1403, § 36\n× 36. The applicant complained in addition that the respondent State's failure to warn and advise her\nparents or monitor her health prior to her diagnosis with leukaemia in October 1970 had given rise to a\nviolation of Article 2 of the Convention. In this connection, the Court considers that the first sentence of\nArticle 2 § 1 enjoins the State not only to refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life, but also to\ntake appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction (cf. the Court's reasoning in\nrespect of Article 8 in the Guerra and Others v. Italy judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 227,\n§ 58, and see also the decision of the Commission on the admissibility of application no. 7154/75 of 12 July\n1978, Decisions and Reports 14, p. 31). It has not been suggested that the respondent State intentionally\nsought to deprive the applicant of her life. The Court's task is, therefore, to determine whether, given the\ncircumstances of the case, the State did all that could have been required of it to prevent the applicant's life\nfrom being avoidably put at risk.\n). This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective\ncriminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by\nlaw-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such\nprovisions. It also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take\n17\n\n\fpreventive operational measures to protect an individual or individuals whose life is at risk from the criminal\nacts of another individual (see the Osman judgment cited above, p. 3159, § 115\n× 115. The Court notes that the first sentence of Article 2 § 1 enjoins the State not only to refrain from the\nintentional and unlawful taking of life, but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those\nwithin its jurisdiction (see the L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments\nand Decisions 1998-III, p. 1403, § 36). It is common ground that the State's obligation in this respect\nextends beyond its primary duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law\nprovisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law-enforcement\nmachinery for the prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions. It is thus\naccepted by those appearing before the Court that Article 2 of the Convention may also imply in certain\nwell-defined circumstances a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures\nto protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual. The scope of this\nobligation is a matter of dispute between the parties.\n).\n16 Cf Cameroon Tribune No. 5231 dated 7 October 1992, page 16\n17 Cf. <> in Cameroun Tribune No. 5246 du 26th October 1992.

Donatti who has made it a general principle (D. Donati I Trattati\ninternazionali nel diritto costituzionale, Turin, Unione tipografico-editrice torinese, 1906, vol. I . p. 343 et\nsuivant). It had already implicitly been done by H. Triepel where he highlighted the difference between\ndomestic law immediately applicable and domestic law that is internationally pertinent (H. Triepel,\nVolkerrecht und Landesrecht, Leipzig Hirschfeld, 1899, p. 299) [édition française : Droit international et droit\ninterne, tr. Par R.

The Court recognises the value of the first\nargument. It cannot overlook that the restoration of democracy as from April 1974 led Portugal to carry out\nan overhaul of its judicial system in troubled circumstances which were without equivalent in most of the\nother European countries and which were rendered more difficult by the process of decolonisation as well\nas by the economic crisis (see paragraph 21 above). Nor does the Court in any way underestimate the\nefforts taken to improve the citizen's access to justice and the administration of the courts, in particular after\nthe promulgation of the Constitution in 1976 (see paragraph 21 above). Nonetheless, the Court must on\nthis issue concur with the views of the Commission and the applicant. In ratifying the Convention, Portugal\nguaranteed to \"secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I\"\n(Article 1) (art. 1). In particular, Portugal undertook the obligation of organising its legal system so as to\nensure compliance with the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), including that of trial within a\n\"reasonable time\" (see the above-mentioned Zimmermann and Steiner judgment, Series A no. 66, p. 12,\npara. 29). The Court would once more draw attention to the extreme importance of this requirement for the\nproper administration of justice.\n); impartiality is unquestionably one of the foremost of those requirements. The Court's task is to determine\nwhether the Contracting States have achieved the result called for by the Convention, not to indicate the\nparticular means to be utilised.[/popup]\n18\n\n\f28 ICJ, Judgement of 9 January 2009, General List no. 139\n29 See para 44\n× 44. The Avena Judgment nowhere lays down or implies that the courts in the United States are required\nto give direct effect to paragraph 153 (9). The obligation laid down in that paragraph is indeed an obligation\nof result which clearly must be performed unconditionally; non-performance of it constitutes internationally\nwrongful conduct. However, the Judgment leaves it to the United States to choose the means of\nimplementation, not excluding the introduction within a reasonable time of appropriate legislation, if deemed\nnecessary under domestic constitutional law. Nor moreover does the Avena Judgment prevent direct\nenforceability of the obligation in question, if such an effect is permitted by domestic law. In short, the\nquestion is not decided in the Court's original Judgment and thus cannot be submitted to it for interpretation\nunder Article 60 of the Statute (Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 20 November 1950 in the\nAsylum Case (Colombia v.

On 14th April 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a communication brought by\nArticle 19 against the State of Eritrea, a State Party to the African Charter.\n2. Article 19 states that it is concerned especially about the continued detention incommunicado without\ntrial of at least 18 journalists in Eritrea since September 2001.\n3. The 18 journalists who are reportedly detained incommunicado are :-\n\n1. Zemenfes Haile, founder and manager of the private weekly Tsigenay;\n2. Ghebrehiwet Keleta, a news writer for Tsigenay;\n3. Selamyinghes Beyene, reporter for the weekly Meqaleh;\n4. Binyam Haile of Haddas Eritrea;\n5. Yosef Mohamed Ali, Chief Editor of Tsigenay;\n6. Seyoum Tsehaye, Freelance Editor and photographer and former Director of Eritrean State\nTelevision (ETV);\n7. Temesgen Gebreyesus, Reporter for Keste Debena;\n8. Mattewos Habteab, Editor of Meqaleh;\n9. Dawit Habtemicheal, Assistant Chief Editor, Meqaleh;\n10. Medhanie Haile, Assistant Chief Editor, Keste Debena;\n11. Fessahye Yohannes (or Joshua) Editor-in-Chief of Setit;\n12. Said Abdulkadir, Chief Editor of Admas;\n13. Amanuel Asrat, Chief Editor of Zemen;\n14. Dawit Isaac, contributor to Setit;\n15. Hamid Mohammed Said, ETV;\n16. Saleh Aljezeeri, Eritrean State Radio; and\n17. Simret Seyoum, a writer and general manager for Setit\n4. The Complainant alleges that on August 2001, a dozen senior officials and other members of the ruling\nelite, known as the G15 signed a public letter criticising President Isaias Afewerki's rule. This letter\nallegedly generated a political crisis which involved defections, resignations, the dismissal of top officials,\nthe imprisonment of government critics and journalists and the cancellation of the general elections that\nhad been planned for December 2001.\n5. The Complainant further alleges that on 18th and 19th September 2001, 11 former Eritrean government\nofficials including former the Vice President Mahmoud Sherifo and the former Foreign Minister Petros\nSolomon were arrested in Asmara.\n6. Furthermore, on 18th September 2001, the Eritrean government banned the entire private press\ncomprising of the following newspapers :- Meqaleh, Setit, Tsigenay, Zemen, Wintana, Admas, Keste\nDebena and Mana. Subsequently, many journalists were arrested and detained, including the 18 journalists\nwho are now being held incommunicado. The reasons given by the government for these actions ranged\nfrom threatening national security to failure to observe licensing requirements.\n7. The Complainant asserts that Hadas Eritrea, a government owned daily newspaper, is the only\npublication allowed in the country\n8. The Complainant states that on 4th October 2002, they sent appeal letters to the President of Eritrea and\nto the Chairman of the African Commission urging them to ensure the unconditional release or a fair trial of\nthe detainees. On 12th November 2002, the Complainant sent a letter to the government requesting\ninformation on the detainees and permission to visit the country and the detainees. Article 19 alleges that\nall requests sent to the government have been ignored.\n\n1\n\n\fComplaint\n9. Article 19 alleges a violation of the following Articles of the African Charter:- Articles 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13,\n18 and 26 of the African Charter.\n\nProcedure\n10. By letter dated 21st April 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the\ncommunication and informed the Complainant that the matter had been scheduled for consideration at the\n33rd Ordinary Session of the African Commission.\n11. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th May 2003, in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\nconsidered the communication and decided to be seized of the matter.\n12. On 10th June 2003, the Secretariat wrote informing the parties to the communication that the African\nCommission had been seized with the matter and requested them to forward their submissions on\nadmissibility within 3 months.\n13. On 27th August 2003, the Secretariat received a Note Verbale from the Respondent State requesting\nthe African Commission to advise Article 19 to exhaust all domestic remedies.\n14. On 10th September 2003, Article 19 forwarded by fax its submissions on admissibility.\n15. On 15th September 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the Note\nVerbale from the Respondent State and the submissions from the Complainant. The Secretariat of the\nAfrican Commission additionally advised the Respondent State to forward its arguments supporting its\nassertion that the Complainant had not exhausted domestic remedies. Article 19 was also reminded to\nforward a copy of the Decree banning the entire private press.\n16. At its 34th Ordinary Session held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission examined the communication and decided to defer further consideration on admissibility of the\nmatter to its 35th Ordinary Session.\n17. On 4th December 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to inform the parties of the\nAfrican Commission's decision. The Respondent State was furnished with another copy of the\nComplainant's written submissions on admissibility and further reminded to forward its written submissions\non admissibility within 2 months.\n18. On 23rd February 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission received submissions on\nadmissibility from the Respondent State. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the said submissions\nand transmitted a copy of the same to the Complainants on 3rd March 2004.\n19. On 17th March 2004, the Secretariat received submissions from the Complainant in response to the\nsubmissions from the State of Eritrea. The Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of\nthe said submissions and transmitted a copy of the same to the Respondent State on 18th March 2004.\n20. At its 35th Ordinary Session held from 21st May to 4th June 2004, in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission examined the communication and decided to defer further consideration on admissibility of the\nmatter to its 36th Ordinary Session pending receipt of information from the Complainant on concrete steps\ntaken to access domestic remedies in Eritrea. The parties to the communication were informed accordingly.\n21. By Note Verbale and letter dated 15th June 2004 the Respondent State and the Complainant were\nrespectively informed of the Commission's decision.\n22. By letter dated 15th September 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission reminded the\nComplainant to send the information requested by the African Commission during the 35th Ordinary\nSession.\n23. At its 36th Ordinary Session held in Dakar, Senegal from 23rd November to 7th December 2004, the\nAfrican Commission considered the communication and declared it admissible.\n24. By Note Verbale of 13th December 2004 and by letter of the same date, the Secretariat of the African\nCommission notified the parties of the African Commission's decision and requested them to submit their\narguments on the merits within three months of the notification.\n25. By Note Verbale dated 27th January 2005, the State of Eritrea wrote to the Secretariat of the African\nCommission requesting the African Commission to dismiss the communication on the grounds that: one of\nthe subjects of the communication had already been dealt in another communication ( 250/2002) and\ntherefore would constitute a case of double jeopardy, and that the Complainant had appeared before the\nAfrican Commission only once despite repeated requests to 'face and question the accuser - a legal right\nwhich was denied them' (...) by the African Commission.\n2\n\n\f26. By Note Verbale dated 23rd February 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged\nreceipt of the Respondent State's Note Verbale and informed the Respondent State that its request would\nbe put before the African Commission for consideration during the 37th Ordinary Session.\n27. By letter dated 24th February 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the\nComplainant that the Respondent State had requested the African Commission to reconsider its decision\non the communication and declare the latter inadmissible.\n28. By letter dated 30th March 2005, the Complainant acknowledged receipt of the Secretariat's letter of\n24th February 2005. The Complainant indicated that they were of the belief that the African Commission\nhad thoroughly examined the communication before arriving at the decision on admissibility and therefore\nurged the African Commission to consider the communication on its merits.\n29. By letter dated 5th April 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the\nComplainant's letter of 30th March 2005 and requested it to submit its arguments on the merits or confirm\nwhether the arguments contained in its complaint were sufficient.\n30. By letter dated 13th April 2005, the Complainant acknowledged receipt of the Secretariat's letter of 5th\nApril 2005 and indicated that in their earlier submissions they had addressed themselves on the merits [of]\nthe communication but further indicated that they were available to make oral submissions on the same.\n31. By letter dated 13th April 2005, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Complainant's letter and\ninformed them that the communication had been scheduled for consideration at the 37th Ordinary Session\nof the African Commission.\n32. At its 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the African Commission deferred further\nconsideration of the communication due to the absence of the rapporteur of the communication.\n33. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 10th June 2005, the Respondent State and the Complainant were\nrespectively notified of the African Commission's decision.\n34. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005, in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nAfrican Commission considered the Respondent State's request that the communication be dismissed but\ndecided to confirm its decision on admissibility.\n35. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 15th December 2005, the Respondent State and the Complainant\nwere respectively notified of the African Commission's decision and requested the parties to submit their\narguments on the merits of the communication.\n36. On 6th March 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the parties reminding them to\nsubmit their arguments on the merits before the end of March 2006.\n37. By electronic mail dated 3rd May 2006, the Complainant re-submitted its arguments on the merits of the\ncommunication, which was immediately communicated to the Respondent State for its comments.\n38. By Note Verbale dated 19th May 2006, the Respondent State submitted its arguments on the merits of\nthe communication.\n39. At its 39th Ordinary Session held from 11th to 25th May 2006, the African Commission decided to defer\nconsideration of the merits to the 40th Ordinary Session, in order to allow the Secretariat to consider the\nparties' arguments and draft an opinion on the merits.\n40. By Note Verbale and letter dated 31st May 2006, the Respondent State and the Complainant were\nrespectively notified of the African Commission's decision.\n41. By letter dated 17th October 2006 and Note Verbale dated 18th October 2006, the Complainant and the\nRespondent State respectively were reminded that the African Commission would consider the merits of\nthe communication at its 40th Ordinary Session.\n42. By Note Verbale and letter dated 10th February 2007, the Respondent State and the Complainant were\nrespectively notified that the African Commission had deferred the communication, as it was unable to\nconsider the said communication at its 40th Ordinary Session because of lack of time. Both the\nComplainant and the Respondent State were informed that the communication would be considered at the\n41st Ordinary Session of the African Commission.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n43. The current communication is submitted pursuant to Article 55, of the African Charter which allows the\nAfrican Commission to receive and consider communications, other than from States Parties. Article 56 of\nthe African Charter provides that the admissibility of a communication submitted pursuant to Article 55 is\n3\n\n\fsubject to seven conditions.1 The African Commission has stressed that the conditions laid down in Article\n56 are conjunctive, meaning that if any one of them is absent, the communication will be declared\ninadmissible.2\n44. The parties to the present communication seem to agree that six of the conditions set out in Article 56\nhave been met. They are however in dispute over the application of one of the conditions - Article 56.5,\nwhich provides that communications relating to human and peoples' rights referred to in Article 55, received\nby the African Commission shall be considered if they \"are sent after the exhaustion of local remedies, if\nany, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged\".\n45. The exhaustion of local remedies rule is a principle under international law of permitting States to solve\ntheir internal problems in accordance with their own constitutional procedures before accepted international\nmechanisms can be invoked. The particular State is thus enabled to have an opportunity to redress the\nwrong that has occurred there within its own legal order. It is a well established rule of customary\ninternational law that before international proceedings are instituted, the various remedies provided by the\nState should have been exhausted.\n46. The African Commission has held in previous communications that for local remedies to be exhausted,\nthey must be available, effective and sufficient. In communication Nos 147/95 and 149/96, the African\nCommission held that a remedy is considered available if the Complainant can pursue it without\nimpediment, it is deemed effective if it offers a prospect of success, and it is found sufficient if it is capable\nof redressing the complaint.3\n47. In terms of Article 56(5), therefore, the law on exhaustion of domestic remedies presupposes:\n1. the existence of domestic procedures for dealing with the claim;\n2. the justiciability or otherwise, domestically, of the subject-matter of the complaint;\n3. the existence under the municipal legal order of provisions for redress of the type of wrong being\ncomplained of; and\n4. available effective local remedies, that is, remedies sufficient or capable of redressing the wrong\ncomplained of.\n48. The second part of Article 56(5) which is the subject of contention between the parties provides that a\ncommunication shall be considered if they are sent after the exhaustion of local remedies \"...if any, unless it\nis obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged\". It follows therefore that the local remedies rule is not\nrigid. It does not apply if:\n1. local remedies are inexistent;\n2. local remedies are unduly and unreasonably prolonged;\n3. recourse to local remedies is made impossible;\n4. from the face of the complaint there is no justice or there are no local remedies to exhaust, for\nexample, where the judiciary is under the control of the executive organ responsible for the illegal\nact; and\n5. ]>\n\nIssues before the African Commission\n\n49. The parties to the present case are in dispute over the question of the exhaustion of domestic remedies\nin Eritrea and it is therefore for the African Commission to make a determination on the matter.\n50. On the one hand, the State argues that the stipulated requirement in Article 56(5) has not been fulfilled\nby the Complainant and that none of the above-mentioned exceptions should therefore apply. On the other\nhand, the Complainant alleges that the exception rule in Article 56(5) should apply.\n51. Whenever a State alleges the failure by the Complainant to exhaust domestic remedies, it has the\nburden of showing that the remedies that have not been exhausted are available, effective and sufficient to\ncure the violation alleged, i.e. that the function of those remedies within the domestic legal system is\nsuitable to address an infringement of a legal right and are effective.4 When a State does this, the burden of\nresponsibility then shifts to the Complainant who must demonstrate that the remedies in question were\nexhausted or that the exception provided for in Article 56(5) of the African Charter is applicable.\n4\n\n\fSubmissions by the Complainant\n\n52. The Complainant in the present communication argues that domestic remedies are not available and\nnotes that the fact that the victims have been held for over three years (since September 2001)\nincommunicado \"is a manifestation of the fact that the administration of justice in Eritrea is extremely\nabnormal\".\n53. The Complainant further points to the fact that Section 17 of the Eritrean Constitution provides\nsafeguards against the arbitrary arrest and detention of persons, and the Government of Eritrea has failed\nto abide by these safeguards. 5 The Complainant claims that the \"deliberate failure of the government to\nabide by its own Constitutional obligation shows that it is hopeless and impractical or unreasonable for the\ndetainees to seize the domestic courts by way of habeas corpus\".\n54. The Complainant further argues that the Executive Branch of Government in Eritrea interferes in the\naffairs of the Judiciary thus rendering the latter's independence and effectiveness suspect. They cite the\nremoval of the Chief Justice by the President of the Republic when the former allegedly requested the\nExecutive not to interfere in the Judiciary. The Complainant noted that \"if the Chief Justice could be\nremoved from office for merely asking the Executive Branch of Government not to interfere with the\nindependence of the Judiciary, what will happen to any judge who dares to order the release of the\ndetainees marked out as 'traitors' and 'State enemies' by the highest authority, the President\"?\n55. The Complainant notes further that the human rights violations complained of are serious and massive\nand in terms of the jurisprudence of the African Commission, such violations do not necessitate the\nexhaustion of local remedies.\n56. The Complainant concludes by stating that in fact, they had sent a writ of habeas corpus to the Minister\nof Justice requesting that the victims be brought to court but received no response from the Minister, and\nthat they had requested to visit the victims but were not granted permission by the Responding State.\nSubmissions by the State\n\n57. The Respondent State in its submission maintains that the Eritrean Judiciary is independent and that\nthe Complainant should have exhausted local remedies either directly or through local legal\nrepresentatives. The Respondent State submits that it informed the Complainant that they should take the\ninitiative to approach the courts directly in order to seek justice for the detainees but no such efforts were\nmade by the Complainant.\n58. The Respondent State further submits that the claims by the Complainant that there is an \"information\nblackout\" and that the Eritrean Judiciary lacks independence are unfounded as they are not substantiated\nby concrete examples indicating that there has been no interference in the actual work of the judges and in\nthe dispensation of justice in the country. With respect to the dismissal of the Chief Justice, the Respondent\nState argues that in Eritrea the President appoints the Chief Justice and therefore has the power to dismiss\nhim.6\n59. Article 52 of the Eritrean Constitution provides for the removal and suspension of judges. Sub-Article 1\nprovides that a judge may be removed from office before the expiry of his tenure of office by the President\nonly, acting on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, pursuant to the provisions of\nsub-Article 2 of this Article for physical or mental incapacity, violation of the law or [J]udicial [C]ode of\n[E]thics. Sub-Article 2 provides that the Judicial Service Commission shall investigate whether or not a\njudge should be removed from office on grounds of those enumerated in sub-Article 1 of this Article. In\ncase the Judicial Service Commission decides that a judge should be removed from office, it shall present\nits recommendation to the President. And sub-Article 3 provides that the President may, on the\nrecommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, suspend from office a judge who is under\ninvestigation. The State did not indicate whether these procedural safeguards had been followed but simply\nintimated that the Chief Justice is appointed by the President and can be dismissed by the President.\n60. In his oral submission during the 35th Ordinary Session, the representative of the Respondent State\nreiterated that the allegations made by the Complainant were false and unfounded as they had been made\nwithout any serious attempts by the Complainants to ascertain the facts before bringing the matter before\nthe African Commission. Furthermore, the Complainants had not submitted themselves to the courts in\nEritrea and as such it is the responsibility of the Complainant to find ways and means of utilising the\ndomestic courts prior to bringing the matter before the African Commission. He reminded the African\nCommission that all conditions of Article 56 must be met in order for a matter to be admitted and if any one\n5\n\n\fof the conditions is not met, the communication must be declared inadmissible.\n61. The representative of the Respondent State informed the African Commission that the incarcerated\njournalists had been arrested by the police and were being held by executive authorities. However,\nfollowing investigation, an administrative decision was reached to release two of the journalists and that the\ndecision with respect to the remaining incarcerated journalists would be forthcoming.\n62. He conceded that the detainees on whose behalf this communication is brought have not been brought\nbefore a court of law because of the nature of the criminal justice system in Eritrea. He stated that the\ncriminal justice system in Eritrea does not have the institutional capacity to handle cases expeditiously and\nas such there is huge backlog of cases in all the courts in the country.\n63. The Respondent State further stated that contrary to the claims by the Complainant that they were not\nable to visit Eritrea in order to assist the victims, everyone who was involved in the matter relating to the\ndetained journalists and the political detainees was invited to Eritrea including the Complainant who chose\nnot to visit the country.\nDecision of the African Commission on admissibility\n\n64. To determine the question of admissibility of this communication, the African Commission will have to\nanswer, among others, the following questions -:\n• who is required under the African Charter to exhaust local remedies - the author of the\ncommunication or the victim of the alleged human rights violations?;\n• does the removal of a Chief Justice render domestic remedies unavailable and insufficient?;\n• does the fact that a State has failed to abide by its own laws render domestic remedies [\n65. As regards who is required to exhaust local remedies, the African Charter is clear. It indicates in Article\n56(1) that the authors of the communication must indicate their identity even if they claim anonymity. This\npresupposes that domestic remedies are to be exhausted but by the authors. In the consideration of\ncommunications, the African Commission has adopted an actio popularis approach where the author of a\ncommunication need not know or have any relationship with the victim. This is to enable poor victims of\nhuman rights violations on the continent to receive assistance from NGOs and individuals far removed from\ntheir locality. All the author needs to do is to comply with the requirements of Article 56. The African\nCommission has thus allowed many communications from authors acting on behalf of victims of human\nrights violations. Thus, having decided to act on behalf of the victims, it is incumbent on the author of a\ncommunication to take concrete steps to comply with the provisions of Article 56 or to show cause why it is\nimpracticable to do so.\n66. As regards the removal of the Chief Justice, the Complainant fails to demonstrate sufficiently how this\nremoval prevented them from approaching the domestic remedies or how it rendered such domestic\nremedies unavailable, ineffective, \"hopeless, impractical and unreasonable?\" The independence of the\njudiciary is a crucial element of the rule of law. Article 1 of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of\nthe Judiciary7 states that \"the independence of the Judiciary shall be guaranteed by the State and\nenshrined in the Constitution or the law of the country. It is the duty of all governmental and other\ninstitutions to respect and observe the independence of judiciary.\" Article 11 of the same Principles states\nthat \"the term of office of judges, their independence, security ... shall be adequately secured by law.\"\nArticle 18 provides that \"Judges shall be subject to suspension or removal only for reasons of incapacity or\nbehaviour that renders them unfit to discharge their duties.\" Article 30 of the International Bar Association\n(IBA)'s Minimum Standards of Judicial Independence8 also guarantees that \"A Judge shall not be subject\nto removal unless, by reason of a criminal act or through gross or repeated neglect or physical or mental\nincapacity, he has shown himself manifestly unfit to hold the position of judge\" and Article 1(b) states that\n\"Personal independence means that the terms and conditions of judicial service are adequately secured so\nas to ensure that individual judges are not subject to executive control.\" Article 52 (1)\n× (1) A judge may be removed from office before the expiry of his tenure of office by the President only,\nacting on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, pursuant to the provisions of Sub-Article\n2 of this Article for physical or mental incapacity, violation of the law or judicial code of ethics.\nof the Eritrean Constitution provides an almost similar provision.\n67. The issue however is, does the removal of a Chief Justice in a manner inconsistent with international\nstandards render the judiciary in a State unavailable and ineffective? The Complainant was simply casting\n6\n\n\fdoubts about the effectiveness of the domestic remedies. The African Commission is of the view that it is\nincumbent on the Complainant to take all necessary steps to exhaust, or at least attempt the exhaustion of\nlocal remedies. It is not enough for the Complainant to cast aspersion on the ability of the domestic\nremedies of the State due to isolated incidences. In this regard, the African Commission would like to refer\nto the decision of the Human Rights Committee in A v Australia 9 in which the Committee held that \"mere\ndoubts about the effectiveness of local remedies or prospect of financial costs involved did not absolve the\nauthor from pursuing such remedies.\" 10 The African Commission can therefore not declare the\ncommunication admissible based on this argument.\n68. As regards the Complainant's argument that the Government has failed to abide by its own\nconstitutional obligations as provided for in Article 17\n× (1) No person may be arrested or detained save pursuant to due process of law. (2) No person shall be\ntried or convicted for any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence at the time when it was\ncommitted. (3) Every person arrested or detained shall be informed of the grounds for his arrest or\ndetention and the rights he has in connection with his arrest or detention in a language he understands. (4)\nEvery person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be brought before the court within forty-eight\n(48) hours of his arrest, and if this is not reasonably possible, as soon as possible thereafter, and no such\nperson shall be detained in custody beyond such period without the authority of the court. (5) Every person\nshall have the right to petition the court for a Writ of Habeas Corpus. Where the arresting officer fails to\nbring him before the court of law and provide the reason for their arrest, the court shall accept the petition\nand order the release of the prisoner. (6) Every person charged with an offence shall be entitled to a fair\nand public hearing by a court of law; provided, however, that such a court may exclude the press and/or the\npublic from all or any part of the trial for reasons of morals, the public order or national security, as is\nnecessary in a just and democratic society. (7) A person charged with an offence shall be presumed to be\ninnocent, and shall not be punished, unless he is found guilty by a court. (8) Where an accused is\nconvicted, he shall have the right to appeal. No person shall be liable to be tried again for any criminal\noffence on which judgment has been rendered.\nof the Constitution. The African Commission is of the view that the whole essence why human rights\nviolations occur is because governments fail to abide by their domestic as well as international obligations.\nWhen this happens, individuals whose rights have been, are being or are likely to be violated seize the\nlocal courts to invoke their rights in order to compel governments to abide by these obligations. The\nEritrean Constitution provides ample safeguards against persons who are arrested and detained without\ncharge or trial. Apart from sub-Articles 1, 3, and 4 of Article 17, sub-Article 5 of the same article is very\ninstructive. It provides that \"every person shall have the right to petition the court for a Writ of Habeas\nCorpus. Where the arresting officer fails to bring him before the court of law and provide the reason for their\narrest, the court shall accept the petition and order the release of the prisoner\".\n69. In the instant case therefore, the Complainant could, at the very least, have seized the local courts by\nway of a writ of habeas corpus to draw the court's attention to the constitutional provision they claim the\ngovernment has breached. Lawyers often seek the release of detainees by filing a petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. A writ of habeas corpus is a judicial mandate to an arresting officer ordering that an inmate\nbe brought to the court so it can be determined whether or not that person is imprisoned lawfully and\nwhether or not he should be released from custody. A habeas corpus petition is a petition filed with a court\nby a person who objects to his own or another's detention or imprisonment. The writ of habeas corpus has\nbeen described as \"the fundamental instrument for safeguarding individual freedom against arbitrary and\nlawless state action.\"11 It serves as an important check on the manner in which the courts pay respect to\nconstitutional rights.\n70. The Complainant in their submissions does acknowledge that they did send a writ of habeas corpus to\nthe Minister of Justice. The African Commission is of the view that even though it expected the Minister to\nadvise the Complainant on the proper procedure to follow, the failure to do so does not constitute a breach\nof the law. The Ministry of Justice is the same arm of Government that has failed to \"abide by its own\nconstitutional obligations...\" and it is only the courts that can order it to do so. By sending the writ to the\nMinister of Justice, the Complainant cannot claim they were attempting the exhaustion of domestic\nremedies as Article 56(5) requires the exhaustion of legal remedies and not administrative remedies.\n71. As regards the argument that the communication reveals serious and massive violations of human\nrights, the African Commission would like to reiterate its earlier decisions in communication Nos. 16/8812 ,\n25/89, 47/90, 56/91, 100/9313 and 27/89, 46/91, 49/91, 99/9314 that\n\n7\n\n\fit [...] cannot hold the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies to apply literally in cases where it is\nimpractical or undesirable for the Complainant to seize the domestic courts in respect of each individual\ncomplaint. This is the case where there are a large number of victims. Due to the seriousness of the human\nrights situation and the large number of people involved, such remedies as might theoretically exist in the\ndomestic courts are as a practical matter unavailable ...\"\n72. However, as regards the continuous incommunicado detention of the detainees, the African\nCommission would like to note the State Party's acknowledgement that the victims are still being held in\ndetention because of the poor state of the criminal justice system in the country. With respect to this\nargument by the State Party, the African Commission notes that whenever there is a crime that can be\ninvestigated and prosecuted by the State on its own initiative, the State has the obligation to move the\ncriminal process forward to its ultimate conclusion. In such cases, one cannot demand that the\nComplainants, or the victims or their family members assume the task of exhausting domestic remedies\nwhen it is up to the State to investigate the facts and bring the accused persons to court in accordance with\nboth domestic and international fair trial standards.\n73. The African Commission would also like to note that the State party has made a general refutation of\nthe claims alleged and has insisted that domestic remedies do exist and that the Complainant did not\nattempt to exhaust them. The African Commission notes however, that the State party has merely listed in\nabstracto the existence of remedies without relating them to the circumstances of the case, and without\nshowing how they might provide effective redress in the circumstances of the case. 15\n74. In the instant communication therefore, the fact that the Complainant has not sufficiently demonstrated\nthat they have exhausted domestic remedies does not mean such remedies are available, effective and\nsufficient. The African Commission can infer from the circumstances surrounding the case and determine\nwhether such remedies are in fact available, and if they are, whether they are effective and sufficient.\n75. The invocation of the exception to the rule requiring that remedies under domestic law should be\nexhausted provided for in Article 56(5) must invariably be linked to the determination of possible violations\nof certain rights enshrined in the African Charter, such as the right to a fair trial enshrined under Article 7 of\nthe African Charter.16 The exception to the rule on the exhaustion of domestic remedies would therefore\napply where the domestic situation of the State does not afford due process of law for the protection of the\nright or rights that have allegedly been violated. In the present communication, this seems to be the case.\n76. Holding the victims incommunicado for over three years demonstrates a prima facie violation of due\nprocess of the law and in particular, Article 7 of the African Charter. By not taking any action to remedy the\nsituation more than twelve months after the African Commission had been seized of the communication\ngoes to demonstrate that the State has equally failed to demonstrate that domestic remedies are available\nand effective.\n77. Another rationale for the exhaustion requirement is that a government should have notice of a human\nrights violation in order to have the opportunity to remedy such violation, before being called to account by\nan international tribunal. The African Commission is of the view that the State has had ample time and\nnotice of the alleged violation to at least charge the detainees and grant them access to legal\nrepresentation. However, if it is shown that the State has had ample notice and time within which to remedy\nthe situation, even if not within the context of the domestic remedies of the State, as is the case with the\npresent communication, the State may still be said to have been properly inform[ed] and is expected to\nhave taken appropriate steps to remedy the violation alleged. The fact that the State of Eritrea has not\ntaken any action means that domestic remedies are either not available or if they are, not effective or\nsufficient to redress the violations alleged.\n78. The African Commission would like in this regard to refer to its decision in Communication 18/8817\nwhich concerned the detention and torture of the Complainant for more than seven years without charge or\ntrial, the denial of food for long periods, the blocking of his bank account, and the use of his money without\nhis permission. The African Commission held that in such circumstances it is clear that the State has had\nample notice of the violations and should have taken steps to remedy them. The African Commission would\nalso like to restate the position taken in communication 250/2002.18 . In that communication, the African\nCommission was of the view that the situation as presented by the Respondent State does not afford due\nprocess of law for protection of the rights that have been alleged to be violated; the detainees have been\ndenied access to the remedies under domestic law and have thus been prevented from exhausting them.\nFurthermore, there has been unwarranted delay in bringing these detainees to justice.\n79. The situation as presented by the Respondent State does not afford due process of law for protection of\nthe rights that have been alleged to be violated; the detainees have been denied access to the remedies\n8\n\n\funder domestic law and have thus been prevented from exhausting them. Furthermore, there has been\nunwarranted delay in bringing these detainees to justice.\n80. In the Albert Mukong case, the Human Rights Committee held that \"a State party to the Covenant,\nregardless of its level of development, must meet certain minimum standards regarding conditions of\ndetention\".19 This reasoning of the Human Rights Committee can also include the fact that a State party to\nthe African Charter \"regardless of its level of development must meet certain minimum standards regarding\nfair trial or due process conditions\". The Committee concluded that \"the legitimate objective of safeguarding\nand indeed strengthening national unity under difficult political circumstances cannot be achieved by\nattempting to muzzle ... democratic tenets and human rights\".20\n81. The continuous incommunicado detention of the victims without charge bars them from any legal\nrepresentation and makes it difficult for the Complainant or any person interested in assisting them from\nattempting whatever domestic remedies might be available. To leave the detainees to languish in detention\nforever because of the inadequacy of the State's criminal justice system or because there is no one to\naccess the domestic courts on their behalf would be grossly unjust, if not unfair.\n82. In the absence of any concrete steps on the part of the State to bring the victims to court, or to allow\nthem access to their legal representatives three years after their arrest and detention, and more than one\nyear after being seized of the matter, the African Commission is persuaded to conclude that domestic\nremedies, even if available, are not effective and/or sufficient.\nFor this reason, the African Commission declares the communication admissible.\n\nDecision of the African Commission on request by the Respondent State to dismiss the communication\n\n83. The present communication was declared admissible at the 36th Ordinary Session of the African\nCommission's held in Dakar, Senegal from 23rd November to 7th December 2004. In response to the\nAfrican Commission's request for written submissions on the merits, the Respondent State in a Note\nVerbale dated 27th January 2005 wrote requesting the African Commission to dismiss the communication.\nThe Respondent State's grounds for such dismissal were that:• One of the 18 journalists in this matter had been the subject of another communication communication 250/2002 which the African Commission had already disposed of. The Respondent\nState therefore argued that dealing with that person in this matter constitutes double jeopardy;\n• The Complainant had appeared before the African Commission only once despite repeated\nrequests to 'face and question the accuser - a legal right which was denied them'...by the African\nCommission.\n84. In dealing with the Respondent State's request that the communication be dismissed the African\nCommission noted that Article 118(2) stipulate that:\nIf the Commission has declared a communication inadmissible under the Charter, it may reconsider this\ndecision at a later date if it receives a request for reconsideration...\n85. No provision is made therein for the African Commission to dismiss a matter after having declared it\nadmissible. In any case, the victims who are the subject of this communication are still being held in\nincommunicado detention by the Respondent State and are accordingly unable to access domestic\nremedies whether on their own or through legal representatives. It is for these reasons that the African\nCommission has decided not to dismiss the communication and will therefore consider it on the merits.\nDecision on the Merits\n86. The African Commission will not deal with any issue already decided upon in communication 250/2002\n.\n87. Eritrea submits that the acts alleged were undertaken \"against a backdrop of war when the very\nexistence of the nation was threatened\" and that, as a result, the Government was \"duty bound to take\nnecessary precautionary measures (and even suspend certain rights).\" However, unlike other human rights\n9\n\n\finstruments, 21 and as emphasised in communication 74/9222 , the African Charter does not allow States\nParties to derogate from it in times of war or other emergency. The existence of war, international or civil, or\nother emergency situation within the territory of a State party cannot therefore be used to justify violation of\nany of the rights set out in the Charter, and Eritrea's actions must be judged according to the Charter\nnorms, regardless of any turmoil within the State at the time.\n88. The Complainant alleges, and Eritrea does not deny, that 11 political dissidents and 18 journalists have\nbeen detained, incommunicado and without trial, since September 2001. It is also alleged by the\nComplainant, and admitted by the Respondent State, that private newspapers were banned from\nSeptember 2001. Although Eritrea maintains that this ban was temporary, it is not clear from the\ninformation available whether or when the ban was lifted.\n89. The basic facts are not therefore in dispute. However, the versions of the parties vary as regards the\nmotivation for the detention of the individuals concerned and the ban on the press. According to the\nComplainant the arrests were due to the detainees having expressed their opinions and spoken out against\nthe Government; the Respondent State on the other hand claims that the 11 political opponents were\narrested for breaching Articles 259 (attacks on the independence of the State), 260 (impairment of the\ndefence powers of the State) and 261 (high treason) of the Transitional Penal Code of Eritrea. As regards\nthe ban on the press and the detention of the 18 journalists, the Respondent State claims that these\noccurred because, \"the stated newspapers and the leading editors were recruited into the illegal network\norganised for the purpose of ousting the Government through illegal and unconstitutional means.\"\n90. Eritrea's argument, then, is that its actions were justified by the circumstances prevailing within its\nterritory during the relevant period, and permissible under its domestic law. Reference is made to Articles 6\nand 9 of the African Charter, the relevant sections of which provide respectively that:\nNo-one may be deprived of his freedom except for reasons and conditions previously laid down by law; and\nEvery individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinions within the law. [Emphasis\nadded]\n91. Such provisions of the Charter are sometimes referred to as \"claw-back clauses,\" because if \"law\" is\ninterpreted to mean any domestic law regardless of its effect, States Parties to the Charter would be able to\nnegate the rights conferred upon individuals by the Charter.\n92. However, the Commission's jurisprudence has interpreted the so-called claw-back clauses as\nconstituting a reference to international law, meaning that only restrictions on rights which are consistent\nwith the Charter and with States Parties' international obligations should be enacted by the relevant\nnational authorities.23 The lawfulness of Eritrea's actions must therefore be considered against the Charter\nand other norms of international law, rather than by reference to its own domestic laws alone. 24\n93. The arrest and detention of the journalists and political opponents is claimed by the Complainant to\nbreach Articles 6 and 7 of the Charter. Article 6 provides that \"no-one shall be arbitrarily arrested or\ndetained.\" The concept of arbitrary detention is one which both the [African] Commission and other\ninternational human rights bodies have previously expounded upon. In the Albert Mukong Case,25 the\nUnited Nations Human Rights Committee stated that, Arbitrariness is not to be equated with 'against the\nlaw' but must be interpreted more broadly to include elements of inappropriateness, injustice, lack of\npredictability and due process of law...remand in custody pursuant to lawful arrest must not only be lawful\nbut reasonable in all the circumstances...remand in custody must also be necessary in all the\ncircumstances.\nFrom this case it can be inferred that an arrest or detention may be legal according to the letter of domestic\nlaw, but arbitrary and therefore illegal by reason of its inappropriate, unjust or unpredictable nature.\n94. The Eritrean detainees have not been charged, or brought to trial. This in itself constitutes arbitrariness,\nas the [African] Commission has previously stated. In communication 102/93,26 the [African] Commission\nheld that, \"where individuals have been detained without charges being brought...this constitutes an\narbitrary deprivation of their liberty and thus violates Article 6 .\"\n95. Furthermore, the length of time for which the detainees have been kept in custody must be considered.\nBoth parties agreed that the arrests occurred in September 2001. The journalists and political opponents\nhave therefore been detained, without charge or trial, for a period of over 5 years.\n96. Article 7(1)(d) of the Charter provides that all individuals shall have, \"the right to be tried within a\nreasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\" The Commission has exp[ou]nded upon this provision in\nits Resolution on the Right to Recourse and Fair Trial, which states that, \"Persons arrested or detained\nshall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and\n10\n\n\fshall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or be released.\"27\n97. The question of what is reasonable cannot be expressed in terms of a blanket time limit which will apply\nin all cases, but rather must depend on the circumstances. This approach has also been espoused by the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights, which has held that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings is\nto be assessed in accordance with all the circumstances of a case. The European Court will look in\nparticular at the complexity of the case, and the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities.28\n98. Eritrea contends that the delay in bringing these particular detainees to trial is due to the complexity and\ngravity of the offences committed, and to the \"precarious war situation\" existing within the state. However,\nas already stated, it must be borne in mind that States Parties cannot derogate from the Charter in times of\nwar or any other emergency situation. Even if it is assumed that the restriction placed by the Charter on the\nability to derogate goes against international principles, there are certain rights such as the right to life, the\nright to a fair trial, and the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, that\ncannot be derogated from for any reason, in whatever circumstances.\n99. The existence of war in Eritrea cannot therefore be used to justify excessive delay in bringing the\ndetainees to trial. Furthermore, a backlog of cases awaiting trial cannot excuse unreasonable delays, as\nthe European Court of Human Rights has held.29 Further, in the case of Albert Mukong, referred to above,\nthe Human Rights Committee stated that States Parties to the ICCPR must observe certain minimum\nstandards as regards the condition of detention, regardless of their state of development. The Commission\nconsiders that the same principle applies to the length of detention before trial, and that states parties to the\nCharter cannot rely on the political situation existing within their territory or a large number of cases\npending before the courts to justify excessive delay.\n100. Moreover, the detainees are being held incommunicado, and have never been brought before a judge\nto face charges. In these circumstances, the Commission finds that Eritrea has breached the requirement\nof trial within a reasonable time set out in Article 7(1)(d). This is consonant with its previous decisions, such\nas communication 102/9330 , in which 3 years detention was found to be unacceptable, and\ncommunication 103/9331 , in which the Commission stated that 7 years detention without trial, \"clearly\nviolates the 'reasonable time' standard stipulated in the Charter.\"\n101. The fact that the detainees are being held incommunicado also merits further consideration in terms of\ninternational human rights law. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has directed32 that States\nshould make provisions against incommunicado detention, which can amount to a violation of Article 7\n× No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In\nparticular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation.\n(torture and cruel treatment and punishment) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to\nwhich Eritrea has acceded. Furthermore, the [African] Commission itself has stated that, \"holding an\nindividual without permitting him or her to have contact with his or her family, and refusing to inform the\nfamily if and where the individual is being held, is inhuman treatment of both the detainee and the family\nconcerned.\"33\n102. Eritrea has not denied the Complainant's contention that the detainees are being held\nincommunicado, with no access to legal representation or contact with their families, and as the [African]\nCommission has enunciated in many of its previous decisions, where allegations are not disputed by the\nState involved, the Commission may take the facts as provided by the Complainant as a given34 Nor does\nthe political situation described by Eritrea excuse its actions, as Article 5, permits no restrictions or\nlimitations on the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment.\nThe Commission thus finds that Eritrea has violated Article 5, by holding the journalists and political\ndissidents incommunicado without allowing them access to their families.\n103. In keeping with its earlier decisions on similar cases35 , the Commission also finds that such treatment\namounts to a breach of Article 18, as it constitutes violation of the rights of both the detainees and their\nfamilies to protection of family life. Finally, the Commission holds that there has been a violation of Article\n7(1)(c), since the detainees have been allowed no access to legal representation, contrary to the right to be\ndefended by counsel which is protected by that provision of the Charter.\n104. The [African] Commission turns its attention now to the question of whether there has been a violation\nof the detainees' rights to express and disseminate their opinions, as alleged by the Complainant. The\nevents which give rise to this allegation are the ban by the Eritrean government of the private press, and\nthe arrest and detention of the 18 journalists. The Respondent State argues that these actions were\njustified by the activities of the journalists and the newspapers in question, which it considered were aimed\nat overthrowing the government. Further, the Eritrean government claims that its actions did not constitute\n11\n\n\fa breach of the Charter, as Article 9 only protects the expression and dissemination of opinions within the\nlaw.\n105. As explained above, permitting State Parties to construe Charter provisions so that they could be\nlimited or even negated by domestic laws would render the Charter meaningless. Any law enacted by the\nEritrean Government which permits a wholesale ban on the press and the imprisonment of those whose\nviews contradict those of the Government's is contrary to both the spirit and the purpose of Article 9. The\nCommission reiterates its own statement in communications 105/93, 128/94, 130/94 and 152/96:36\n[A]ccording to Article 9.2 of the Charter, dissemination of opinions may be restricted by law. This does not\nmean that national law can set aside the right to express and disseminate one's opinions; this would make\nthe protection of the right to express one's opinions ineffective. To allow national law to have precedence\nover the international law of the Charter would defeat the purpose of the rights and freedoms enshrined in\nthe Charter. International human rights standards must always prevail over contradictory national law. Any\nlimitation on the rights of the Charter must be in conformity with the provisions of the Charter.\n106. By applying norms of international human rights law, the Commission has previously found, and finds\nin this case, that the imprisonment of journalists \"deprives not only the journalists of their rights to freely\nexpress and disseminate their opinions, but also the public, of the right to information. This action is a\nbreach of the provisions of Article 9 of the Charter.\"37\n107. Moreover, banning the entire private press on the grounds that it constitutes a threat to the incumbent\ngovernment is a violation of the right to freedom of expression, and is the type of action that Article 9 is\nintended to proscribe. A free press is one of the tenets of a democratic society, and a valuable check on\npotential excesses by government.\n108. No political situation justifies the wholesale violation of human rights; indeed general restrictions on\nrights such as the right to free expression and to freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention serve only to\nundermine public confidence in the rule of law and will often increase, rather than prevent, agitation within a\nState. The Commission draws on the findings of the UN Human Rights Committee:\nThe legitimate objective of safeguarding and indeed strengthening national unity under difficult political\ncircumstances cannot be achieved by attempting to muzzle advocacy of multi-party democracy, democratic\ntenets and human rights. 38\n\nHolding\n\nFor the reasons given above the Commission:\nHolds a violation of Articles 1, 5, 6, 7(1), 9, and 18 by the State of Eritrea;\nUrges the government of Eritrea to release or to bring to a speedy and fair trial the 18 journalists detained\nsince September 2001, and to lift the ban on the press;\nRecommends that the detainees be granted immediate access to their families and legal representatives;\nand\nRecommends that the government of Eritrea takes appropriate measures to ensure payment of\ncompensation to the detainees.\n\nFootnotes\n1 See Article 56 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.\n2 See African Commission Information Sheet No. 3 Communication Procedure.\n3 Communication Nos. 147/95 and 149/96 Sir Dawda K Jawara/The Gambia, African Commission on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights.\n4 Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Case of Velásquez Rodríguez, Judgment of July 29, 1988, para.\n63.\n5 See Article 17 (1): \"No person may be arrested or detained save pursuant to due process of law.

Preliminary Exceptions [sic][/url], cit., para. 91\n× 1. The rule of prior exhaustion of domestic remedies under the international law of human rights has\ncertain implications that are present in the Convention. Under the Convention, States Parties have an\nobligation to provide effective judicial remedies to victims of human rights violations ( Art. 25 ), remedies\nthat must be substantiated in accordance with the rules of due process of law ( Art. 8(1) ), all in keeping\nwith the general obligation of such States to guarantee the free and full exercise of the rights recognized by\nthe Convention to all persons subject to their jurisdiction ( Art. 1 ). Thus, when certain exceptions to the rule\nof non-exhaustion of domestic remedies are invoked, such as the ineffectiveness of such remedies or the\nlack of due process of law, not only is it contended that the victim is under no obligation to pursue such\nremedies, but, indirectly, the State in question is also charged with a new violation of the obligations\n13\n\n\fassumed under the Convention. Thus, the question of domestic remedies is closely tied to the merits of the\ncase.\n.

The complaint is filed by the Centre for Minority Rights Development (CEMIRIDE) with the assistance of\nMinority Rights Group International (MRG) and the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE which submitted an amicus curiae brief) on behalf of the Endorois community. The Complainants allege\nviolations resulting from the displacement of the Endorois community, an indigenous community, from their\nancestral lands, the failure to adequately compensate them for the loss of their property, the disruption of\nthe community's pastoral enterprise and violations of the right to practise their religion and culture, as well\nas the overall process of development of the Endorois people.\n2. The Complainants allege that the Government of Kenya in violation of the African Charter on Human and\nPeoples' Rights (hereinafter the African Charter), the Constitution of Kenya and international law, forcibly\nremoved the Endorois from their ancestral lands around the Lake Bogoria area of the Baringo and Koibatek\nAdministrative Districts, as well as in the Nakuru and Laikipia Administrative Districts within the Rift Valley\nProvince in Kenya, without proper prior consultations, adequate and effective compensation.\n3. The Complainants state that the Endorois are a community of approximately 60,000 people1 who, for\ncenturies, have lived in the Lake Bogoria area. They claim that prior to the dispossession of Endorois land\nthrough the creation of the Lake Hannington Game Reserve in 1973, and a subsequent re-gazetting of the\nLake Bogoria Game Reserve in 1978 by the Government of Kenya, the Endorois had established, and, for\ncenturies, practised a sustainable way of life which was inextricably linked to their ancestral land. The\nComplainants allege that since 1978 the Endorois have been denied access to their land.\n4. The Complainants state that apart from a confrontation with the Masai over the Lake Bogoria region\napproximately three hundred years ago, the Endorois have been accepted by all neighbouring tribes as\nbona fide owners of the land and that they continued to occupy and enjoy undisturbed use of the land\nunder the British colonial administration, although the British claimed title to the land in the name of the\nBritish Crown.\n5. The Complainants state that at independence in 1963, the British Crown's claim to Endorois land was\npassed on to the respective county councils. However, under Section 115 of the Kenyan Constitution, the\ncountry councils held this land in trust, on behalf of the Endorois community, who remained on the land and\ncontinued to hold, use and enjoy it. The Endorois' customary rights over the Lake Bogoria region were not\nchallenged until the 1973 gazetting of the land by the Government of Kenya. The Complainants state that\nthe act of gazetting and, therefore, dispossession of the land is central to the present communication.\n6. The Complainants state that the area surrounding Lake Bogoria is fertile land, providing green pasture\nand medicinal salt licks, which help raise healthy cattle. The Complainants state that Lake Bogoria is\ncentral to the Endorois religious and traditional practices. They state that the community's historical prayer\nsites, places for circumcision rituals, and other cultural ceremonies are around Lake Bogoria. These sites\nwere used on a weekly or monthly basis for smaller local ceremonies, and on an annual basis for cultural\nfestivities involving Endorois from the whole region. The Complainants claim that the Endorois believe that\nthe spirits of all Endorois, no matter where they are buried, live on in the lake, with annual festivals taking\nplace at the Lake. The Complainants further claim that the Endorois believe that the Monchongoi forest is\nconsidered the birthplace of the Endorois and the settlement of the first Endorois community.\n7. The Complainants state that despite the lack of understanding of the Endorois community regarding\nwhat had been decided by the Respondent State, the Kenyan Wildlife Service (hereinafter KWS) informed\ncertain Endorois elders shortly after the creation of the game reserve that 400 Endorois families would be\ncompensated with plots of \"fertile land.\" The undertaking also specified, according to the Complainants,\nthat the community would receive 25% of the tourist revenue from the game reserve and 85% of the\nemployment generated, and that cattle dips and fresh water dams would be constructed by the Respondent\nState.\n8. The Complainants allege that after several meetings to determine financial compensation for the\nrelocation of the 400 families, the KWS stated it would provide 3,150 Kenya Shillings per family. The\n1\n\n\fComplainants allege that none of these terms have been implemented and that only 170 out of the 400\nfamilies were eventually given some money in 1986, years after the agreements were concluded. The\nComplainants state that the money given to the 170 families was always understood to be a means of\nfacilitating relocation rather than compensation for the Endorois' loss.\n9. The Complainants state that to reclaim their ancestral land and to safeguard their pastoralist way of life,\nthe Endorois petitioned to meet with President Daniel Arap Moi, who was their local Member of Parliament.\nA meeting was held on 28th December 1994 at his Lake Bogoria Hotel.\n10. The Complainants state that as a result of this meeting, the President directed the local authority to\nrespect the 1973 agreement on compensation and directed that 25% of annual income towards community\nprojects be given to the Endorois. In November of the following year, upon being notified by the Endorois\ncommunity that nothing had been implemented, the Complainants state that President Moi again ordered\nthat his directives be followed.\n11. The Complainants state that following the non-implementation of the directives of President Moi, the\nEndorois began legal action against Baringo and Koibatek county councils. Judgment was given on 19th\nApril 2002 dismissing the application.2 Although the High Court recognised that Lake Bogoria had been\nTrust Land for the Endorois, it stated that the Endorois had effectively lost any legal claim as a result of the\ndesignation of the land as a game reserve in 1973 and in 1974. It concluded that the money given in 1986\nto 170 families for the cost of relocating represented the fulfilment of any duty owed by the authorities\ntowards the Endorois for the loss of their ancestral land.\n12. The Complainants state that the High Court also stated clearly that it could not address the issue of a\ncommunity's collective right to property, referring throughout to \"individuals\" affected and stating that \"there\nis no proper identity of the people who were affected by the setting aside of the land ... that has been\nshown to the Court\". The Complainants also claim that the High Court stated that it did not believe Kenyan\nlaw should address any special protection to a people's land based on historical occupation and cultural\nrights.\n13. The Complainants allege that since the Kenyan High Court case in 2000, the Endorois community has\nbecome aware that parts of their ancestral land have been demarcated and sold by the Respondent State3\nto third parties.\n14. The Complainants further allege that concessions for ruby mining on Endorois traditional land were\ngranted in 2002 to a private company. This included the construction of a road in order to facilitate access\nfor heavy mining machinery. The Complainants claim that these activities incur a high risk of polluting the\nwaterways used by the Endorois community, both for their own personal consumption and for use by their\nlivestock. Both mining operations and the demarcation and sale of land have continued despite the request\nby the African Commission to the President of Kenya to suspend these activities pending the outcome of\nthe present communication.\n15. The Complainants state that following the commencement of legal action on behalf of the community,\nsome improvements were made to the community members' access to the Lake. For example, they are no\nlonger required to pay game reserve entrance fees. The Complainants, nevertheless, allege that this\naccess is subject to the game reserve authority's discretion. They claim that the Endorois still have limited\naccess to Lake Bogoria for grazing their cattle, for religious purposes, and for collecting traditional herbs.\nThey also state that the lack of legal certainty surrounding access rights and rights of usage renders the\nEndorois completely dependent on the game reserve authority's discretion to grant these rights on an ad\nhoc basis.\n16. The Complainants claim that land for the Endorois is held in very high esteem, since tribal land, in\naddition to securing subsistence and livelihood, is seen as sacred, being inextricably linked to the cultural\nintegrity of the community and its traditional way of life. Land, they claim, belongs to the community and not\nthe individual and is essential to the preservation and survival as a traditional people. The Complainants\nclaim that the Endorois health, livelihood, religion and culture are all intimately connected with their\ntraditional land, as grazing lands, sacred religious sites and plants used for traditional medicine are all\nsituated around the shores of Lake Bogoria.\n17. The Complainants claim that at present the Endorois live in a number of locations on the periphery of\nthe reserve - that the Endorois are not only being forced from fertile lands to semi-arid areas, but have also\nbeen divided as a community and displaced from their traditional and ancestral lands. The Complainants\nclaim that for the Endorois, access to the Lake Bogoria region, is a right for the community and the\nGovernment of Kenya continues to deny the community effective participation in decisions affecting their\nown land, in violation of their right to development.\n2\n\n\f18. The Complainants further allege that the right to legal representation for the Endorois is limited, in that\nJuma Kiplenge, the lawyer and human rights defender who was representing the 20,000 Endorois nomadic\npastoralists, was arrested in August 1996 and accused of \"belonging to an unlawful society\". They claim\nthat he has also received death threats.\n19. The Complainants allege that the Government's decision to gazette Endorois traditional land as a game\nreserve, which in turn denies the Endorois access to the area, has jeopardized the community's pastoral\nenterprise and imperilled its cultural integrity. The Complainants also claim that 30 years after the evictions\nbegan, the Endorois still do not have full and fair compensation for the loss of their land and their rights on\nto it. They further allege that the process of evicting them from their traditional land not only violates\nEndorois community property rights, but spiritual, cultural and economic ties to the land are severed.\n20. The Complainants allege that the Endorois have no say in the management of their ancestral land. The\nEndorois Welfare Committee, which is the representative body of the Endorois community, has been\nrefused registration, thus denying the right of the Endorois to fair and legitimate consultation. This failure to\nregister the Endorois Welfare Committee, according to the Complainants, has often led to illegitimate\nconsultations taking place, with the authorities selecting particular individuals to lend their consent 'on\nbehalf' of the community. The Complainants further submit that the denial of domestic legal title to their\ntraditional land, the removal of the community from their ancestral home and the severe restrictions placed\non access to the Lake Bogoria region today, together with a lack of adequate compensation, amount to a\nserious violation of the African Charter. The Complainants state that the Endorois community claims these\nviolations both for themselves as a people and on behalf of all the individuals affected.\n21. The Complainants allege that in the creation of the game reserve, the Respondent State disregarded\nnational law, Kenyan Constitutional provisions and, most importantly, numerous articles of the African\nCharter, including the right to property, the right to free disposition of natural resources, the right to religion,\nthe right to cultural life and the right to development.\n\nArticles Alleged to Have Been Violated\n22. The Complainants seek a declaration that the Republic of Kenya is in violation of Articles 8, 14, 17, 21\nand 22 of the African Charter. The Complainants are also seeking:\n• Restitution of their land, with legal title and clear demarcation.\n• Compensation to the community for all the loss they have suffered through the loss of their\nproperty, development and natural resources, but also freedom to practice their religion and culture.\n\nProcedure\n23. On 22nd May 2003, the Centre for Minority Rights and Development (CEMIRIDE) forwarded to the\nSecretariat of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the Secretariat) a formal letter of\nintent regarding the forthcoming submission of a communication on behalf of the Endorois community.\n24. On 9th June 2003, the Secretariat wrote a letter to the Centre for Minority Rights and Development,\nacknowledging receipt of the same.\n25. On 23rd June 2003, the Secretariat wrote a letter to Cynthia Morel of Minority Rights Group\nInternational, who is assisting the Centre for Minority Rights Development, acknowledging her\ncommunication and informed her that the complaint would be presented to the upcoming 34th Ordinary\nSession of the African Commission.\n26. A copy of the complaint, dated 28th August 2003, was sent to the Secretariat on 29th August 2003.\n27. At its 34th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 6th to 20th November 2003, the African\nCommission examined the complaint and decided to be seized thereof.\n28. On 10th December 2003, the Secretariat wrote to the parties informing them of this decision and further\nrequesting them to forward their written submissions on admissibility before the 35th Ordinary Session.\n29. As the Complainants had already sent their submissions, when the communication was being sent to\nthe Secretariat, the Secretariat wrote a reminder to the Respondent State to forward its written submissions\non admissibility.\n\n3\n\n\f30. By a letter of 14th April 2004, the Complainants requested the African Commission on Human and\nPeoples' Rights (the African Commission) to be allowed to present their oral submissions on the matter at\nthe Session.\n31. On 29th April 2004, the Secretariat sent a reminder to the Respondent State to forward its written\nsubmissions on admissibility of the communication.\n32. At its 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 21st May to 4th June 2004, the African\nCommission examined the complaint and decided to defer its decision on admissibility to the next session.\nThe African Commission also decided to issue an Urgent Appeal to the Government of the Republic of\nKenya, requesting it to stay any action or measure by the State in respect of the subject matter of this\ncommunication, pending the decision of the African Commission, which was forwarded on 9th August 2004.\n33. At the same Session, a copy of the complaint was handed over to the delegation of the Respondent\nState.\n34. On 17th June 2004, the Secretariat wrote to both parties informing them of this decision and requesting\nthe Respondent State to forward its submissions on admissibility before the 36th Ordinary Session.\n35. A copy of the same communication was forwarded to the Respondent State's High Commission in\nAddis Ababa, Ethiopia on 22 June 2004.\n36. On 24th June 2004, the Kenyan High Commission in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, informed the Secretariat\nthat it had conveyed the African Commission's communication to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kenya.\n37. The Secretariat sent a similar reminder to the Respondent State on 7th September 2004, requesting it\nto forward its written submissions on the admissibility of the communication before the 36th Ordinary\nSession.\n38. During the 36th Ordinary Session held in Dakar, Senegal, from 23rd November to 7th December 2004,\nthe Secretariat received a hand-written request from the Respondent State for a postponement of the\nmatter to the next Session. At the same Session, the African Commission deferred the case to the next\nsession to allow the Respondent State more time to forward its submissions on admissibility.\n39. On 23rd December 2004, the Secretariat wrote to the Respondent State informing it of this decision and\nrequesting it to forward its submissions on admissibility as soon as possible.\n40. Similar reminders were sent out to the Respondent State on 2nd February and 4th April 2005.\n41. At its 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 27th April to 11th May 2005, the African\nCommission considered this communication and declared it admissible after the Respondent State had\nfailed to cooperate with the African Commission on the admissibility procedure despite numerous letters\nand reminders of its obligations under the Charter.\n42. On 7th May 2005, the Secretariat wrote to the parties to inform them of this decision and requested\nthem to forward their arguments on the merits.\n43. On 21st May 2005, the Chairperson of the African Commission addressed an urgent appeal to the\nPresident of the Republic of Kenya on reports received alleging the harassment of the Chairperson of the\nEndorois Assistance Council who is involved in this communication.\n44. On 11th and 19th July 2005, the Secretariat received the Complainants' submissions on the merits,\nwhich were forwarded to the Respondent State.\n45. On 12th September 2005, the Secretariat wrote a reminder to the Respondent State.\n46. On 10th November 2005, the Secretariat received an amicus curiae brief on the case from COHRE.\n47. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nAfrican Commission considered the communication and deferred its decision on the merits to the 39th\nOrdinary Session.\n48. On 30th January 2006, the Secretariat informed the Complainants of this decision.\n49. By a Note Verbale of 5th February 2006, which was delivered by hand to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nof the Republic of Kenya through a member of staff of the Secretariat who travelled to the country in March\n2006, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State of this decision by the African Commission. Copies of\nall the submissions by the Complainants since the opening of this file were enclosed thereto.\n50. By an email of 4th May 2006, the Senior Principal State Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General of\nthe Respondent State requested the African Commission to defer the consideration of this communication\non the basis that the Respondent State was still preparing a response to the matter which it claimed to be\nquite protracted and involved many departments.\n51. By a Note Verbale of 4th May 2006, which was received by the Secretariat on the same day, the\nSolicitor General of the Respondent State formally requested the African Commission to defer the matter to\nthe next Session noting mainly that due to the wide range of issues contained in the communication, its\n4\n\n\fresponse would not be ready for submission before the 39th Ordinary Session.\n52. At its 39th Ordinary Session held from 11th to 25th May 2006 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission considered the communication and deferred its consideration of the same to its 40th Ordinary\nSession to await the outcome of amicable settlement negotiations underway between the Complainants\nand the Respondent State.\n53. The Secretariat of the African Commission notified the parties of this decision accordingly.\n54. On 31st October 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a letter from the\nComplainants reporting that the parties had had constructive exchanges on the matter and that the matter\nshould be heard on the merits in November 2006 by the African Commission. The Complainants also\napplied for leave to have an expert witness heard during the 40th Ordinary Session.\n55. At the 40th Ordinary Session, the African Commission deferred its decision on the merits of the\ncommunication after having heard the expert witness called in by the Complainant. The Respondent State\nalso made presentations. Further documents were submitted at the session and, later on, during the\nintersession; more documentation was received from both parties before the 41st Ordinary Session.\n56. During the 41st Ordinary Session, the Complainants submitted their final comments on the last\nsubmission by the Respondent State.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n57. The Respondent State has been given ample opportunity to forward its submissions on admissibility on\nthe matter. Its delegates at the previous two Ordinary Sessions of the African Commission were supplied\nwith hard copies of the complaint. There was no response from the Respondent State. The African\nCommission has no option but to proceed with considering the admissibility of the communication based on\nthe information at its disposal.\n58. The admissibility of communications brought pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter is governed\nby the conditions stipulated in Article 56 of the African Charter. This article lays down seven (7) conditions,\nwhich generally must be fulfilled by a complainant for a communication to be admissible.\n59. In the present communication, the complaint indicates its authors (Article 56(1)), is compatible with the\nOrganisation of African Unity /African Union Charters and that of the African Charter on Human and\nPeoples' Rights (Article 56(2)), and it is not written in disparaging language (Article 56(3)). Due to lack of\ninformation that the Respondent State should have supplied, if any, the African Commission is not in a\nposition to question whether the complaint is exclusively based on news disseminated through the mass\nmedia (Article 56(4)), has exhausted local remedies (Article 56(5)), and has been settled elsewhere per\n(Article 56(7)) of the African Charter. With respect to the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies, in\nparticular, the Complainants approached the High Court in Nakuru, Kenya, in November 1998. The matter\nwas struck out on procedural grounds. A similar claim was made before the same court in 2000 as a\nconstitutional reference case, in which order was sought as in the previous case. The matter was, however,\ndismissed on the grounds that it lacked merits and held that the Complainants had been properly consulted\nand compensated for their loss. The Complainants thus claim that as constitutional reference cases could\nnot be appealed, all possible domestic remedies have been exhausted.\n60. The African Commission notes that there was a lack of cooperation from the Respondent State to\nsubmit arguments on the admissibility of the communication despite numerous reminders. In the absence\nof such a submission, given the face value of the Complainants' submission, the African Commission holds\nthat the complaint complies with Article 56 of the African Charter and hence declares the communication\nadmissible.\n61. In its submission on the merits, the Respondent State requested the African Commission to review its\ndecision on admissibility. It argued that even though the African Commission had gone ahead to admit the\ncommunication, it would nevertheless, proceed to submit arguments why the African Commission should\nnot be precluded from re-examining the admissibility of the communication, after the oral testimony of the\nRespondent State, and dismissing the communication.\n62. In arguing that the African Commission should not be a tribunal of first instance, the Respondent State\nargues that the remedies sought by the Complainants in the High Court of Kenya could not be the same as\nthose sought from the African Commission.\n\n5\n\n\f63. For the benefit of the African Commission, the Respondent State outlined the issues put before the\nCourt in Misc, Civil Case No: 183 of 2002:\n1. A Declaration that the land around Lake Baringo is the property of the Endorois community, held in\ntrust for its benefit by the County Council of Baringo and the County Council of Koibatek, under\nSections 114 and 115 of the Constitution of Kenya.\n2. A Declaration that the County Council of Baringo and the County Council of Koibatek are in breach\nof fiduciary duty of trust to the Endorois community, because of their failure to utilise benefits\naccruing from the game reserve to the benefit of the community contrary to Sections 114 and 115 of\nthe Constitution of Kenya.\n3. A Declaration that the Complainants and the Endorois community are entitled to all the benefits\ngenerated through the game reserve exclusively and / or in the alternative the land under the game\nreserve should revert to the community under the management of trustees appointed by the\ncommunity to receive and invest the benefits in the interest of the community under Section 117 of\nthe Constitution of Kenya.\n4. An award of exemplary damages arising from the breach of the applicants' constitutional rights\nunder Section 115 of the Constitution of Kenya.\n64. The Respondent State informs the African Commission that the Court held that procedures governing\nthe setting apart of the game reserve were followed. The Respondent State further states that it went\nfurther to advise the Complainants that they should have exercised their right of appeal under Sections 10,\n11 and 12 of the Trust Land Act, Chapter 288, Laws of Kenya, in the event that they felt that the award of\ncompensation was not fairly handled. None of the applicants had appealed, and the High Court was of the\nview that it was too late to complain.\n65. The Respondent State also states that the Court opined that the application did not fall under Section\n84 (Enforcement of Constitutional Rights) since the application did not plead any violations or likelihood of\nviolations of their rights under Sections 70 - 83 of the Constitution.\n66. It further argues that the communication irregularly came before the African Commission as the\napplicants did not exhaust local remedies regarding the alleged violations. This is because:\n1. The Complainants did not plead that their rights had been contravened or likely to be contravened\nby the High Court Misc. Civil Case 183 of 2002. It states that the issue of alleged violations of any of\nthe rights claimed under the present communication has, therefore, not been addressed by the local\ncourts. This means that the African Commission will be acting as a court of first instance. The\nRespondent State argues that the applicants should, therefore, be asked to exhaust local remedies\nbefore approaching the African Commission.\n2. The Complainants did not pursue other administrative remedies available to them. The Respondent\nState argues that the allegations that the Kenyan legal system has no adequate remedies to\naddress the case of the Endorois are untrue and unsubstantiated. It argues that in matters of human\nrights the Kenya High Court has been willing to apply international human rights instruments to\nprotect the rights of the individual.\n67. The Respondent State further says that the Kenyan legal system has a very comprehensive description\nof property rights, and provides for the protection of all forms of property in the Constitution. It argues that\nwhile various international human rights instruments, including the African Charter, recognise the right to\nproperty, these instruments have a minimalist approach and do not satisfy the kind of property protected.\nThe Respondent State asserts that the Kenyan legal system goes further than provided for in international\nhuman rights instruments.\n68. The Respondent State further states that land as property is recognised under the Kenyan legal system\nand various methods of ownership are recognised and protected. These include private ownership (for\nnatural and artificial persons), communal ownership either through the Land (Group Representatives) Act\nfor adjudicated land, which is also called the Group Ranches or the Trust Lands managed by the County\nCouncil, within whose area of jurisdiction it is situated for the benefit of the persons ordinarily resident on\nthat land. The State avers that the Land Group Act gives effect to such right of ownership, interests or other\nbenefits of the land as may be available, under African customary law.\n\n6\n\n\f69. The Respondent State concludes that Trust Lands are established under the Constitution of Kenya and\nadministered under an Act of Parliament and that the Constitution provides that Trust Land may be\nalienated through:\n• Registration to another person other than the County Council;\n• An Act of Parliament providing for the County Council to set apart an area of Trust Land.\n70. Rule 118(2) of the African Commission's Rules of Procedure states that: If the Commission has\ndeclared a communication inadmissible under the Charter, it may reconsider this decision at a later date if it\nreceives a request for reconsideration.\nThe African Commission notes the arguments advanced by the Respondent State to reopen its decision on\nadmissibility. However, after careful consideration of the Respondent State's arguments, the African\nCommission is not convinced that it should reopen arguments on the admissibility of the communication. It\ntherefore declines the Respondent State's request.\nMerits\nComplainants' Submission on the Merits\n\n71. The arguments below are the submissions of the Complainants, taking also into consideration their oral\ntestimony at the 40th Ordinary Session, all their written submissions, including letters and supporting\naffidavits.\n72. The Complainants argue that the Endorois have always been the bona fide owners of the land around\nLake Bogoria.4 They argue that the Endorois' concept of land did not conceive the loss of land without\nconquest. They argue that as a pastoralist community, the Endorois' concept of \"ownership\" of their land\nhas not been one of ownership by paper. The Complainants state that the Endorois community have\nalways understood the land in question to be \"Endorois\" land, belonging to the community as a whole and\nused by it for habitation, cattle, beekeeping, and religious and cultural practices. Other communities would,\nfor instance, ask permission to bring their animals to the area.5\n73. They also argue that the Endorois have always considered themselves to be a distinct community.\nThey argue that historically the Endorois are a pastoral community, almost solely dependent on livestock.\nTheir practice of pastoralism has consisted of grazing their animals (cattle, goats, sheep) in the lowlands\naround Lake Bogoria in the rainy season, and turning to the Monchongoi Forest during the dry season.\nThey claim that the Endorois have traditionally relied on beekeeping for honey and that the area\nsurrounding Lake Bogoria is fertile land, providing green pasture and medicinal salt licks, which help raise\nhealthy cattle. They argue that Lake Bogoria is also the centre of the community's religious and traditional\npractices: around the lake are found the community's historical prayer sites, the places for circumcision\nrituals, and other cultural ceremonies. These sites were used on a weekly or monthly basis for smaller local\nceremonies, and on an annual basis for cultural festivities involving Endorois from the whole region.\n74. The Complainants argue that the Endorois believe that spirits of all former Endorois, no matter where\nthey are buried, live on in the Lake. Annual festivals at the lake took place with the participation of Endorois\nfrom the whole region. They say that Monchongoi forest is considered the birthplace of the Endorois people\nand the settlement of the first Endorois community. They also state that the Endorois community's\nleadership is traditionally based on elders. Though under the British colonial administration, chiefs were\nappointed, this did not continue after Kenyan independence. They state that more recently, the community\nformed the Endorois Welfare Committee (EWC) to represent its interests. However, the local authorities\nhave refused to register the EWC despite two separate efforts to do so since its creation in 1996.\n75. The Complainants argue that the Endorois are a 'people', a status that entitles them to benefit from\nprovisions of the African Charter that protect collective rights. The Complainants argue that the African\nCommission has affirmed the rights of \"peoples'' to bring claims under the African Charter in the case of\nSocial and Economic Rights Action Center and Center for Economic and Social Rights v. Nigeria (the\nOgoni Case) stating: \"The African Charter in Articles 20 through 24 clearly provides for peoples' to retain\nrights as peoples', that is, as collectives. The importance of community and collective identity in African\nculture is recognised throughout the African Charter.\" 6 They further argue that the African Commission\nnoted that when there is a large number of individual victims, it may be impractical for each individual\nComplainant to go before domestic courts. In such situations, as was with the Ogoni case, the African\nCommission can adjudicate the rights of a people as a collective. They therefore argue that the Endorois,\n7\n\n\fas a people, are entitled to bring their claims collectively under those relevant provisions of the African\nCharter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 8- The Right to Practice Religion\n\nArticle 8 of the African Charter states:\nFreedom of conscience, the profession and free practice of religion shall be guaranteed. No one may,\nsubject to law and order, be submitted to measures restricting the exercise of these freedoms.\n76. The Complainants allege violation to practice their religion. They claim that the Kenyan Authorities'\ncontinual refusal to give the community a right of access to religious sites to worship freely amounts to a\nviolation of Article 8.\n77. The Complainants argue that the African Commission has embraced the broad discretion required by\ninternational law in defining and protecting religion. In the case of 25/89-47/90-56/91-100/93 Free Legal\nAssistance Group and Others v. Zaire, they argue that the African Commission held that the practices of\nthe Jehovah's Witnesses were protected under Article 8. 7 In the present communication, the Complainants\nstate that the Endorois' religion and beliefs are protected by Article 8 of the African Charter and constitute a\nreligion under international law. The Endorois believe that the Great Ancestor, Dorios, came from the\nHeavens and settled in the Mochongoi Forest. After a period of excess and luxury, the Endorois believe\nthat God became angry and, as punishment, sank the ground one night, forming Lake Bogoria. The\nEndorois believe themselves to be descendants of the families who survived that event.\n78. They state that each season the water of the lake turns red and the hot springs emit a strong odour. At\nthis time, the community performs traditional ceremonies to appease the ancestors who drowned with the\nformation of the lake. The Endorois regard both Mochongoi Forest and Lake Bogoria as sacred grounds,\nand have always used these locations for key cultural and religious ceremonies, such as weddings,\nfunerals, circumcisions, and traditional initiations.8\n79. The Complainants argue that the Endorois, as an indigenous group whose religion is intimately tied to\nthe land, require special protection. Lake Bogoria, they argue, is of fundamental religious significance to all\nEndorois. The religious sites of the Endorois people are situated around the lake, where the Endorois pray,\nand religious ceremonies are regularly connected with the Lake. Ancestors are buried near the lake, and as\nstated above, they claim that Lake Bogoria is considered the spiritual home of all Endorois, living and dead.\nThe lake, the Complainants argue, is therefore essential to the religious practices and beliefs of the\nEndorois.\n80. The Complainants argue that by evicting the Endorois from their land, and by refusing the Endorois\ncommunity access to the Lake and other surrounding religious sites, the Kenyan Authorities have interfered\nwith the Endorois' ability to practice and worship as their faith dictates. In violation of Article 8 of the African\nCharter, the Complainants argue that religious sites within the game reserve have not been properly\ndemarcated and protected. They further argue that since their eviction from the Lake Bogoria area, the\nEndorois have not been able to freely practice their religion. Access as of right for religious rituals - such as\ncircumcisions, marital rituals, and initiation rights - has been denied the community. Similarly, the Endorois\nhave not been able to hold or participate in their most significant annual religious ritual, which occurs when\nthe Lake undergoes seasonal changes.\n81. Citing the African Commission's jurisprudence in 48.90-50.91-52.91-89.93-Amnesty-International-v.-S,\nthe Complainants argue that the African Commission recognised the centrality of practice to religious\nfreedom, noting that the State Party violated the authors' right to practice religion because non-Muslims did\nnot have the right to preach or build their churches and were subjected to harassment, arbitrary arrest, and\nexpulsion.9 In addition, they argue, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples gives\nindigenous peoples the right \"to maintain, protect and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural\nsites...\" 10 They state that only through unfettered access will the Endorois be able to protect, maintain, and\nuse their sacred sites in accordance with their religious beliefs.\n82. Citing the case of Loren Laroye Riebe Star,11 the Complainants argue that the Inter-American\nCommission on Human Rights (IAcmHR) has determined that expulsion from lands central to the practice\nof religion constitutes a violation of religious freedoms. In the above case, the Complainants argue that the\nIACmHR held that the expulsion of priests from the Chiapas area was a violation of the right to associate\n8\n\n\ffreely for religious purposes. They further state that the IACmHR came to a similar conclusion in Dianna\nOrtiz v. Guatemala. This was a case concerning a Catholic nun who fled Guatemala after State actions\nprevented her from freely exercising her religion.12 Here, the IACmHR decided that her right to freely\npractice her religion had been violated, because she was denied access to the lands most significant to\nher.13\n83. The Complainants argue that the current management of the game reserve has failed both to fully\ndemarcate the sacred sites within the Reserve and to maintain sites that are known to be sacred to the\nEndorois.14 They argue that the Kenyan authorities' failure to demarcate and protect religious sites within\nthe game reserve constitutes a severe and permanent interference with the Endorois' right to practice their\nreligion. Without proper care, sites that are of immense religious and cultural significance have been\ndamaged, degraded, or destroyed. They cite \"The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\"\nwhich state in part that: \"States shall take effective measures, in conjunction with the indigenous peoples\nconcerned, to ensure that indigenous sacred places, including burial sites, be preserved, respected and\nprotected.\"15\n84. The Complainants also accuse the Kenyan authorities of interfering with the Endorois' right to freely\npractice their religion by evicting them from their land, and then refusing to grant them free access to their\nsacred sites. This separation from their land, they argue, prevents the Endorois from carrying out sacred\npractices central to their religion.\n85. They argue that even though Article 8 provides that states may interfere with religious practices \"subject\nto law and order\", the Endorois religious practices are not a threat to law and order, and thus there is no\njustification for the interference. They argue that the limitations placed on the state's duties to protect rights\nshould be viewed in light of the underlying sentiments of the African Charter. In Amnesty International v.\nZambia, the Complainants argue that the African Commission noted that it was \"of the view that the\n'claw-back' clauses must not be interpreted against the principles of the Charter... Recourse to these\nshould not be used as a means of giving credence to violations of the express provisions of the Charter.\" 16\nAlleged Violation of Article 14- The Right to Property\n\nArticle 14 of the African Charter states:\nThe right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be encroached upon in the interest of public need or\nin the general interest of the community and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\n86. The Complainants argue that the Endorois community has a right to property with regard to their\nancestral land, the possessions attached to it, and their cattle. They argue that these property rights are\nderived both from Kenyan law and the African Charter, which recognise indigenous peoples' property rights\nover their ancestral land. The Complainants argue that the Endorois' property rights have been violated by\nthe continuing dispossession of the Lake Bogoria land area. They argue that the impact on the community\nhas been disproportionate to any public need or general community interest.\n87. Presenting arguments that Article 14 of the Charter has been violated, the Complainants argue that for\ncenturies the Endorois have constructed homes, cultivated the land, enjoyed unchallenged rights to\npasture, grazing, and forest land, and relied on the land to sustain their livelihoods around the lake. They\nargue that in doing so, the Endorois exercised an indigenous form of tenure, holding the land through a\ncollective form of ownership. Such behaviour indicated traditional African land ownership, which was rarely\nwritten down as a codification of rights or title, but was, nevertheless, understood through mutual\nrecognition and respect between landholders. 'Land transactions' would take place only by way of conquest\nof land.\n88. The Complainants argue that even under colonial rule when the British Crown claimed formal\npossession of Endorois land, the colonial authorities recognised the Endorois' right to occupy and use the\nland and its resources. They argue that in law, the land was recognised as the \"Endorois Location\" and in\npractice the Endorois were left largely undisturbed during colonial rule. They aver that the Endorois\ncommunity continued to hold such traditional rights, interests and benefits in the land surrounding Lake\nBogoria even upon the creation of the independent Republic of Kenya in 1963. They state that on 1st May\n1963, the Endorois land became 'Trust Land' under Section 115(2) of the Kenyan Constitution, which\nstates:\n9\n\n\fEach County Council shall hold the Trust Land vested in it for the benefit of the persons ordinarily resident\non that land and shall give effect to such rights, interests or other benefits in respect of the land as may,\nunder the African customary law for the time being in force and applicable thereto, be vested in any tribe,\ngroup, family or individual.\n89. They argue that through centuries of living and working on the land, the Endorois were \"ordinarily\nresident on [the] land\" , and their traditional form of collective ownership of the land qualifies as a \"right,\ninterest or other benefit... under African customary law\" vested in \"any tribe, group [or] family\" for the\npurposes of Section 115(2). They, therefore, argue that as a result, under Kenyan law, the Baringo and\nKoibatek County Councils were - and indeed still are - obligated to give effect to the rights and interests of\nthe Endorois as concerns the land.\n\nProperty Rights and Indigenous Communities\n\n90. The Complainants argue that both international and domestic courts have recognised that indigenous\ngroups have a specific form of land tenure that creates a particular set of problems, which include the lack\nof \"formal\" title recognition of their historic territories, the failure of domestic legal systems to acknowledge\ncommunal property rights, and the claiming of formal legal title to indigenous land by the colonial\nauthorities. They state that this situation has led to many cases of displacement from a people's historic\nterritory, both by the colonial authorities and post-colonial states relying on the legal title they inherited from\nthe colonial authorities.\n91. In pursuing that line of reasoning, the Complainants argue that the African Commission itself has\nrecognised the problems faced by traditional communities in the case of dispossession of their land in a\nReport of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations/Communities, where it states: [...] their customary\nlaws and regulations are not recognised or respected and as national legislation in many cases does not\nprovide for collective titling of land. Collective tenure is fundamental to most indigenous pastoralist and\nhunter-gatherer communities and one of the major requests of indigenous communities is therefore the\nrecognition and protection of collective forms of land tenure. 17\n92. They argue that the jurisprudence of the African Commission notes that Article 14 includes the right to\nproperty both individually and collectively.\n93. Quoting the case of The Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni v Nicaragua,18 they argue that indigenous\nproperty rights have been legally recognised as being communal property rights, where the Inter-American\nCourt of Human Rights (IACtHR) recognised that the Inter-American Convention protected property rights\n\"in a sense which includes, among others, the rights of members of the indigenous communities within the\nframework of communal property.\"19\n94. The Complainants further argue that the courts have addressed violations of indigenous property rights\nstemming from colonial seizure of land, such as when modern states rely on domestic legal title inherited\nfrom colonial authorities. They state that national courts have recognised that right. Such decisions were\nmade by the United Kingdom Privy Council as far back as 1921,20 the Canadian Supreme Court21 and the\nHigh Court of Australia.22 Quoting the Richtersveld case, they argue that the South African Constitutional\nCourt held that the rights of a particular community survived the annexation of the land by the British Crown\nand could be held against the current occupiers of their land.23\n95. They argue that the protection accorded by Article 14 of the African Charter includes indigenous\nproperty rights, particularly to their ancestral lands. The Endorois' right, they argue, to the historic lands\naround Lake Bogoria are therefore protected by Article 14. They aver that property rights protected go\nbeyond those envisaged under Kenyan law and include a collective right to property.\n96. They argue that as a result of the actions of the Kenyan authorities, the Endorois' property has been\nencroached upon, in particular by the expropriation, and in turn, the effective denial of ownership of their\nland. They also state that the Kenyan justice system has not provided any protection of the Endorois'\nproperty rights. Referring to the High Court of Kenya, they argue that it stated that it could not address the\nissue of a community's right to property.24\n97. The Complainants argue that the judgment of the Kenyan High Court also stated in effect that the\nEndorois had lost any rights under the trust, without the need for compensation beyond the minimal\namounts actually granted as costs of resettlement for 170 families. They argue that the judgment also\n10\n\n\fdenies that the Endorois have rights under the trust, despite being \"ordinarily resident\" on the land. The\nCourt, they claimed, stated:\nWhat is in issue is a national natural resource. The law does not allow individuals to benefit from such a\nresource simply because they happen to be born close to the natural resource.\n98. They argue that in doing so, the High Court dismissed those arguments based not just on the trust, but\nalso on the Endorois' rights to the land as a 'people' and as a result of their historic occupation of Lake\nBogoria.\n99. The Complainants cite a number of encroachments, they claim, that go to the core of the community's\nidentity as a 'people', including:\n• the failure to provide adequate recognition and protection in domestic law of the community's rights\nover the land, in particular the failure of Kenyan law to acknowledge collective ownership of land;\n• the declaration of the game reserve in 1973/74, which purported to remove the community's\nremaining property rights over the land, including its rights as beneficiary of a trust under Kenyan\nlaw;\n• the lack of and full compensation to the Endorois community for the loss of their ability to use and\nbenefit from their property in the years after 1974;\n• the eviction of the Endorois from their land, both in the physical removal of Endorois families living\non the land and the denial of the land to the rest of the Endorois community, and the resulting loss\nof their non-movable possessions on the land, including dwellings, religious and cultural sites and\nbeehives;\n• the significant loss by the Endorois of cattle as a result of the eviction;\n• the denial of benefit, use of and interests in their traditional land since eviction, including the denial\nof any financial benefit from the lands resources, such as that generated by tourism;\n• the awarding of land to title to private individuals and the awarding of mining concessions on the\ndisputed land.\n100. The Complainants argue that an encroachment upon property will constitute a violation of Article 14,\nunless it is shown that it is in the general or public interest of the community and in accordance with the\nprovisions of appropriate laws. They further argue that the test laid out in Article 14 of the Charter is\nconjunctive, that is, in order for an encroachment not to be in violation of Article 14, it must be proven that\nthe encroachment was in the interest of the public need/general interest of the community and was carried\nout in accordance with appropriate laws and must be proportional. Quoting the Commission's own case\nlaw, the Complainants argue that: 'The justification of limitations must be strictly proportionate with and\nabsolutely necessary for the advantages which follow.25 They argue that both the European Court of\nHuman Rights26 and the IACmHR have held that limitations on rights must be \"proportionate and\nreasonable.\" 27\n101. They argue that in the present communication, in the name of creating a game reserve, the Kenyan\nauthorities have removed the Endorois from their land, and destroyed their possessions, including houses,\nreligious constructions, and beehives. They argue that the upheaval and displacement of an entire\ncommunity and denial of their property rights over their ancestral lands are disproportionate to any public\nneed served by the game reserve. They state that even assuming that the creation of the game reserve\nwas a legitimate aim and served a public need, it could have been accomplished by alternative means\nproportionate to the need.\n102. They further argue that the encroachment on to Endorois property rights must be carried out in\naccordance with \"appropriate laws\" in order to avoid a violation of Article 14, and that this provision must, at\nthe minimum mean that both Kenyan law and the relevant provisions of international law were respected.\nThey argue that the violation of the Endorois' rights failed to respect Kenyan law on at least three levels: (i)\nthere was no power to expel them from the land; (ii) the trust in their favour was never legally extinguished,\nbut simply ignored; and (iii) adequate compensation was never paid.\n103. The Complainants state that the traditional land of the Endorois is classified as Trust Land under\nSection 115 of the Constitution, and that this obliges the County Council to give effect to \"such rights,\ninterests or other benefits in respect of the land as may under the African customary law, for the time being\nin force.\" They argue that it created a beneficial right for the Endorois over their ancestral land.\n\n11\n\n\f104. They further argue that the Kenyan Authorities created the Lake Hannington Game Reserve, including\nthe Endorois indigenous land, on 9th November 1973, but changed the name to Lake Bogoria Game\nReserve in a Second Notice in 1974.28 The 1974 'Notice' was made by the Kenyan Minister for Tourism\nand Wildlife under the Wild Animals Protection Act (WAPA).29 WAPA, the Complainants informs the African\nCommission, applied to Trust Land as it did to any other land, and did not require that the land be taken out\nof the Trust before a game reserve could be declared over that land. They argue that the relevant\nlegislation did not give authority for the removal of any individual or group occupying the land in a game\nreserve. Instead, WAPA merely prohibited the hunting, killing or capturing of animals within the game\nreserve.30 Yet, the Complainants argue, despite a lack of legal justification, the Endorois Community were\ninformed from 1973 onwards that they would have to leave their ancestral lands.\n105. Moreover, they argue, the declaration of the Lake Bogoria Game Reserve by way of the 1974 notice\ndid not affect the status of the Endorois' land as Trust Land. The obligation of Baringo and Koibatek County\nCouncils to give effect to the rights and interests of the Endorois community continued. They state that the\nonly way under Kenyan law in which the Endorois benefits under the trust could have been dissolved is\nthrough the County Council or the President of Kenya having to \"set apart\" the land. However, the Trust\nLand Act required that to be legal, such setting apart of the land must be published in the Kenyan\nGazette.31\n106. The Complainants argue that as far as the community is aware, no such notice was published. Until\nthis is done, they argue, Trust Land encompassing Lake Bogoria cannot have been set apart and the\nAfrican customary law rights of the Endorois people continue under Kenyan law.32 They state that the\nKenyan High Court failed to protect the Endorois' rights under the Trust to a beneficial property right, and\nthe instruction given to the Endorois to leave their ancestral lands was also not authorised by Kenyan law.\n107. They conclude that as a result, the Kenyan authorities have acted in breach of trust and not in\n'accordance with the provisions of the law' for the purposes of Article 14 of the Charter.\n108. They further argue that even if Endorois land had been set apart, Kenyan law still requires the\ncompensation of residents of lands that are set apart; that the Kenyan Constitution states that where Trust\nLand is set apart, the government must ensure:\n[T]he prompt payment of full compensation to any resident of the land set apart who - (a) under the African\ncustomary law for the time being in force and applicable to the land, has a right to occupy any part of the\nland.33\n109. Citing Kenyan law, the Complainants argue that the Kenyan Land Acquisition Act outlines factors that\nshould be considered in determining the compensation to be paid,34 starting with the basic principle that\ncompensation should be based on the market value of the land at the time of the acquisition. Other\nconsiderations include: damages to the interested person caused by the removal from the land and other\ndamages including lost earnings, relocation expenses and any diminution of profits of the land. The Land\nAcquisition Act provides for an additional 15% of the market value to be added to compensate for\ndisturbances. Under Kenyan law if a court finds the amount of compensation to be insufficient, 6% interest\nper year must be paid on the difference owed to the interested parties.35\n110. They state that only 170 families of at least 400 families forced to leave Endorois traditional land by\nthe Kenyan Authorities have received some form of monetary assistance. In 1986, 170 families evicted in\nlate 1973 from their homes within the Lake Bogoria Game Reserve, each received around 3,150 Kshs. At\nthe time, this was equivalent to approximately ?30.\n111. They state that further amounts in compensation for the value of the land lost, together with revenue\nand employment opportunities from the game reserve, were promised by the Kenyan authorities, but these\nhave never been received by the community.\n112. They argue that the Respondent State has itself recognised that the payment of 3,150 Kshs per family\namounted only to 'relocation assistance', and did not constitute full compensation for loss of land. The\nComplainants argue that international law also lays down strict requirements for compensation in the case\nof expropriation of property.36 They argue that the fact that such payment was made some 13 years after\nthe first eviction, and that it does not represent the market value of the land gazetted as Lake Bogoria\nGame Reserve, means that the Respondent State would not have paid \"prompt, full compensation\" as\nrequired by the Constitution on the setting apart of the Trust Land. Therefore Kenyan law has not been\ncomplied with. Moreover, the Complainants argue, the fact that members of the Endorois community\naccepted the very limited monetary compensation does not mean that they accepted this as full\ncompensation, or indeed that they accepted the loss of their land. They state that even if the Respondent\n12\n\n\fState had formally set apart the Trust Land by way of Gazette Notice, the test of \"in accordance with the\nprovisions of law\" required by Article 14 of the Charter would not have been satisfied, due to the payment of\ninadequate compensation.\n113. The Complainants argue that the requirement that any encroachment on property rights be in\naccordance with the \"appropriate laws\" must also include relevant international laws. They argue that the\nRespondent State, including the courts, has failed to apply international law on the protection of indigenous\nland rights, which includes the need to recognise the collective nature of land rights, to recognise historic\nassociation, and to prioritise the cultural and spiritual and other links of the people to a particular territory.\nInstead, Kenyan law gives only limited acknowledgement to African customary law. The Trust Land system\nin Kenya provides in reality only minimal rights, as a trust (and therefore African customary law rights, such\nas those of the Endorois) can be extinguished by a simple decision of the executive. They argue that the\ncrucial issue of recognition of the collective ownership of land by the Endorois is not acknowledged at all in\nKenyan law, as is clearly shown by the High Court judgment. Encroachment on the Endorois' property did\nnot therefore comply with the appropriate international laws on indigenous peoples' rights. They state that\nthe Endorois have also suffered significant property loss as a result of their displacement as detailed\nabove, including the loss of cattle, and that the only \"compensation\" received was the eventual provision of\ntwo cattle dips, which does not compensate for the loss of the salt licks around the Lake or the substantial\nloss of traditional lands.\n114. They conclude that the fact that international standards on indigenous land rights and compensation\nwere not met, as well as that provisions of Kenyan law were ignored, means that the encroachment upon\nthe property of the Endorois community was not in accordance with the \"appropriate laws\" for the purposes\nof Article 14 of the Charter.\nAlleged Violations of Articles 17(2) and (3)- The Right to Culture\n\nArticles 17(2) and (3) states that: (2) Every individual may freely take part in the cultural life of his\ncommunity. (3) The promotion and protection of morals and traditional values recognised by the community\nshall be the duty of the State.\n115. The Complainants argue that the Endorois community's cultural rights have been violated as a result\nof the creation of a game reserve. By restricting access to Lake Bogoria, the Kenyan authorities have\ndenied the community access to a central element of Endorois cultural practice. After defining culture to\nmean the sum total of the material and spiritual activities and products of a given social group that\ndistinguishes it from other similar groups,37 they argue that the protection of Article 17 can be invoked by\nany group that identifies with a particular culture within a State. But they argue that it does more than that.\nThey argue that Article 17 extends to the protection of indigenous cultures and ways of life.\n116. They argue that the Endorois have suffered violations of their cultural rights on two counts. In the first\ninstance, the community has faced systematic restrictions on access to sites, such as the banks of Lake\nBogoria, which are of central significance for cultural rites and celebrations. The community's attempts to\naccess their historic land for these purposes was described as \"trespassing\" and met with intimidation and\ndetention. Secondly, and separately, the cultural rights of the community have been violated by the serious\ndamage caused by the Kenyan Authorities to their pastoralist way of life.\n117. With mining concessions now underway in proximity to Lake Bogoria, the Complainants argue that\nfurther threat is posed to the cultural and spiritual integrity of the ancestral land of the Endorois.\n118. They also argue that unlike Articles 8 and 14 of the African Charter, Article 17 does not have an\nexpress clause allowing restrictions on the right under certain circumstances. They state that the absence\nof such a clause is a strong indication that the drafters of the Charter envisaged few, if any, circumstances\nin which it would be appropriate to limit a people's right to culture. However, if there is any restriction, the\nrestriction must be proportionate to a legitimate aim and in line with principles of international law on human\nand peoples' rights. The Complainants argue that the principle of proportionality requires that limitations be\nthe least restrictive possible to meet the legitimate aim.\n119. The Complainants thus argue that even if the creation of the game reserve constitutes a legitimate\naim, the Respondent State's failure to secure access by right for the celebration of the cultural festival and\nrituals cannot be deemed proportionate to that aim.\n\n13\n\n\fAlleged Violation of Article 21- Rights to Free Disposition of Natural Resources\n\nArticle 21 of the Charter states that: 1) All peoples shall freely dispose of their wealth and natural\nresources. This right shall be exercised in the exclusive interest of the people. In no case shall a people be\ndeprived of it. 2) In case of spoliation the dispossessed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of\nits property as well as to an adequate compensation.\n120. The Complainants argue that the Endorois community are unable to access the vital resources in the\nLake Bogoria region since their eviction from the game reserve. The medicinal salt licks and fertile soil that\nkept the community's cattle healthy are now out of the community's reach. Mining concessions to Endorois\nland have been granted without giving the Endorois a share in these resources. Consequently, the\nEndorois suffer a violation of Article 21: Right to Natural Resources.\n121. They argue that in the Ogoni Case (2001), paras 56-58 the right to natural resources contained within\ntheir traditional land was vested in the indigenous people and that a people inhabiting a specific region\nwithin a State can claim the protection of Article 21.38 They argue that the right to freely dispose of natural\nresources is of crucial importance to indigenous peoples and their way of life. They quote from the report of\nthe African Commission's Working Group of Experts on Indigenous Populations/Communities which states:\nDispossession of land and natural resources is a major human rights problem for indigenous peoples ...\n.The establishment of protected areas and national parks has impoverished indigenous pastoralist and\nhunter-gatherer communities, made them vulnerable and unable to cope with environmental uncertainty\nand, in many cases, even displaced them ... This [the loss of fundamental natural resources] is a serious\nviolation of the African Charter (Article 21(1) and (2)), which states clearly that all peoples have the right to\nnatural resources, wealth and property.39\n122. Citing the African Charter, the Complainants argue that the Charter creates two distinct rights to both\nproperty (Article 14) and the free disposal of wealth and natural resources (Article 21). They argue that in\nthe context of traditional land, the two rights are very closely linked and violated in similar ways. They state\nthat Article 21 of the African Charter is, however, wider in its scope than Article 14, and requires respect for\na people's right to use natural resources, even where a people does not have title to the land.\n123. The Complainants point out that the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.10 states that: \"Particular\nattention should be given to the rights of indigenous peoples to use and develop the lands that they occupy,\nto be protected against illegal intruders, and to have access to natural resources (such as forests, wildlife,\nand water) vital to their subsistence and reproduction.\" 40\n124. They state that the Endorois as a people enjoy the protection of Article 21 with respect to Lake\nBogoria and the wealth and natural resources arising from it. They argue that for the Endorois, the natural\nresources include traditional medicines made from herbs found around the lake and the resources, such as\nsalt licks and fertile soil, which provided support for their cattle and therefore their pastoralist way of life.\nThese, the Complainants argue, were natural resources from which the community benefited before their\neviction from their traditional land. In addition, Article 21 also protects the right of the community to the\npotential wealth of their land, including tourism, rubies, and other possible resources. They state that since\ntheir eviction from Lake Bogoria, the Endorois, in violation of Article 21, have been denied unhindered\naccess to the land and its natural resources, as they can no longer benefit from the natural resources and\npotential wealth, including that generated by recent exploitation of the land, such as the revenues and\nemployment created by the game reserve and the product of mining operations.\nAlleged Violation of Article 22- The Right to Development\n\nArticle 22 of the African Charter states that: All peoples shall have the right to their economic, social and\ncultural development with due regard to their freedom and identity and in the equal enjoyment of the\ncommon heritage of mankind.\n125. On the issue of the right to development, the Complainants argue that the Endorois' right to\ndevelopment has been violated as a result of the Respondent State's failure to adequately involve the\nEndorois in the development process and the failure to ensure the continued improvement of the Endorois\ncommunity's well-being.\n\n14\n\n\f126. The Complainants argue that the Endorois have seen the set of choices and capabilities open to them\nshrink since their eviction from the game reserve. They argue that due to the lack of access to the lake, the\nsalt licks and their usual pasture, the cattle of the Endorois died in large numbers. Consequently, they were\nnot able to pay their taxes and, as a result, the Kenyan Authorities took away more cattle.\n127. They stress the point that the Endorois had no choice but to leave the lake. They argue that this lack\nof choice for the community directly contradicts the guarantees of the right to development. They state that\nif the Kenyan authorities had been providing the right to development as promised by the African Charter,\nthe development of the game reserve would have increased the capabilities of the Endorois.\n128. Citing the Ogoni Case, para. 46, the Complainants argue that the African Commission has noted the\nimportance of choice to well-being. They state that the African Commission noted that the state must\nrespect rights holders and the \"liberty of their action.\"41 They argue that the liberty recognised by the\nCommission is tantamount to the choice embodied in the right to development. By recognising such liberty,\nthey argue, the African Commission has started to embrace the right to development as a choice.\nElaborating further on the right to development, they argue that the same 'liberty of action' principle can be\napplied to the Endorois community in the instant communication.\n129. They argue that choice and self-determination also include the ability to dispose of natural resources\nas a community wishes, thereby requiring a measure of control over the land. They further argue that for\nthe Endorois, the ability to use the salt licks, water, and soil of the Lake Bogoria area has been eliminated,\nundermining this partner (the Endorois community) of self-determination. In that regard, the Complainants\nargue, it is clear that development should be understood as an increase in peoples' well-being, as\nmeasured by capacities and choices available. The realisation of the right to development, they say,\nrequires the improvement and increase in capacities and choices. They argue that the Endorois have\nsuffered a loss of well-being through the limitations on their choice and capacities, including effective and\nmeaningful participation in projects that will affect them.\n130. Citing the Human Rights Committee (HRC), they argue that the Committee addressed the\neffectiveness of consultation procedures in Mazurka v. New Zealand.42 The Complainants argue that the\nHRC found that the broad consultation process undertaken by New Zealand had effectively provided for the\nparticipation of the Maori people in determining fishing rights. The New Zealand authorities had negotiated\nwith Maori representatives and then allowed the resulting Memorandum of Understanding to be debated\nextensively by Maoris throughout the country.43 The Complainants argue that the Committee specifically\nnoted that the consultation procedure addressed the cultural and religious significance of fishing to the\nMaori people, and that the Maori representatives were able to affect the terms of the final settlement.\n131. The inadequacy of the consultations undertaken by the Kenyan authorities, the Complainants argue, is\nunderscored by Endorois actions after the creation of the game reserve. The Complainants inform the\nAfrican Commission that the Endorois believed, and continue to believe even after their eviction, that the\ngame reserve and their pastoralist way of life would not be mutually exclusive and that they would have a\nright of re-entry into their land. They assert that in failing to understand the reasons for their permanent\neviction, many families did not leave the location until 1986.\n132. They argue that the course of action left the Endorois feeling disenfranchised from a process of utmost\nimportance to their life as a people. Resentment of the unfairness with which they had been treated\ninspired some members of the community to try to reclaim Mochongoi Forest in 1974 and 1984, meet with\nthe President to discuss the matter in 1994 and 1995, and protest the actions in peaceful demonstrations.\nThey state that if consultations had been conducted in a manner that effectively involved the Endorois,\nthere would have been no ensuing confusion as to their rights or resentment that their consent had been\nwrongfully gained.\n133. They further say that the requirement of prior, informed consent has also been delineated in the case\nlaw of the IACmHR. Referring the African Commission to the case of Mary and Carrie Dan v. USA, they\nargue that the IACmHR noted that convening meetings with the community 14 years after title\nextinguishment proceedings began constituted neither prior nor effective participation.44 They state that to\nhave a process of consent that is fully informed \"requires at a minimum that all of the members of the\ncommunity are fully and accurately informed of the nature and consequences of the process and provided\nwith an effective opportunity to participate individually or as collectives.\"45\n134. The Complainants are also of the view that the Respondent State violated the Endorois' right to\ndevelopment by engaging in coercive and intimidating activity that has abrogated the community's right to\nmeaningful participation and freely given consent. They state that such coercion has continued to the\npresent day. The Complainants say that Mr Charles Kamuren, the Chair of the Endorois Welfare Council,\n15\n\n\fhad informed the African Commission of details of threats and harassment he and his family and other\nmembers of the community have received, especially when they objected to the issue of the granting of\nmining concessions.\n135. The Complainants further argue that the Endorois have been excluded from participating or sharing in\nthe benefits of development. They argue that the Respondent State did not embrace a rights-based\napproach to economic growth, which insists on development in a manner consistent with, and instrumental\nto, the realisation of human rights and the right to development through adequate and prior consultation.\nThey assert that the Endorois' development as a people has suffered economically, socially and culturally.\nThey further conclude that the Endorois community suffered a violation of Article 22 of the Charter.\nRespondent State Submissions on Merits\n\n136. In response to the brief submitted by the Complainants on the Merits including the amicus curiae Brief\nby COHRE, the Respondent State, the Republic of Kenya, submitted its reply on the merits of the\ncommunication to the African Commission.\n137. The arguments below are the submissions of the Respondent State, taking into consideration their\noral testimony at the 40th Ordinary Session of the African Commission, all their written submissions,\nincluding letters, supporting affidavits, video evidence and the 'Respondents Submissions and Further\nClarifications Arising Out of the Questions by the Commissioners During the Merits Hearing of the\nCommunication'.\n138. The Respondent State argues that most of the tribes do not reside in their ancestral lands owing to\nmovements made due to a number of factors, including search for pastures for their livestock; search for\narable land to carry out agriculture; relocation by government to facilitate development; creation of irrigation\nschemes, national parks, game reserves, forests and extraction of natural resources, such as minerals.\n139. The Respondent State argues that it has instituted a programme for universal free primary education\nand an agricultural recovery programme, which aims at increasing the household income of the rural poor,\nincluding the Endorois. It states that it has not only initiated programmes for the equitable distribution of\nbudgetary resources, but has also formulated an economic recovery strategy for wealth and employment\ncreation, which seeks to eradicate poverty and secure the economic and social rights of the poor and the\nmarginalised, including the Endorois.\n140. The Respondent State argues that the land around the Lake Bogoria area is occupied by the Tugen\ntribe, which comprises four clans:\n141. The Endorois - who have settled around Mangot, Mochongoi and Tangulmbei; The Lebus - who have\nsettled around Koibatek District; The Somor - who live around Maringati, Sacho, Tenges and Kakarnet;\nand, The Alor - living around Kaborchayo, Paratapwa, Kipsalalar and Buluwesa.\n142. The Respondent State argues that all the clans co-exist in one geographical area. It states that it is\nnoteworthy that they all share the same language and names, which means that they have a lot in\ncommon. The Respondent State disputes that the Endorois are indeed a community / sub-tribe or clan on\ntheir own, and it argues that it is incumbent on the Complainants to prove that the Endorois are distinct\nfrom the other Tugen sub-tribe or indeed the larger Kalenjin tribe before they can proceed to make a case\nbefore the African Commission.\n143. The Respondent State maintains that following the Declaration of the Lake Bogoria Game Reserve,\nthe government embarked on a re-settlement exercise, culminating in the resettlement of the majority of the\nEndorois in the Mochongoi settlement scheme. It argues that this was over and above the compensation\npaid to the Endorois after their ancestral land around lake was gazetted. It further states that there is no\nsuch thing as Mochongoi Forest in Kenya and the only forest in the area is Ol Arabel Forest.\nDecision on Merits\n\n144. The present communication alleges that the Respondent State has violated the human rights of the\nEndorois community, an indigenous people, by forcibly removing them from their ancestral land, the failure\nto adequately compensate them for the loss of their property, the disruption of the community's pastoral\nenterprise and violations of the right to practice their religion and culture, as well as the overall process of\ndevelopment of the Endorois people.\n145. Before addressing the articles alleged to have been violated, the Respondent State has requested the\nAfrican Commission to determine whether the Endorois can be recognised as a 'community'/sub-tribe or\nclan on their own. The Respondent State disputes that the Endorois are a distinct community in need of\n16\n\n\fspecial protection. The Respondent State argues that the Complainants need to prove this distinction from\nthe Tugen sub-tribe or indeed the larger Kalenjin tribe. The immediate questions that the African\nCommission needs to address itself to are:\n146. Are the Endorois a distinct community? Are they indigenous peoples and thereby needing special\nprotection? If they are a distinct community, what makes them different from the Tugen sub-tribe or indeed\nthe larger Kalenjin tribe?\n147. Before responding to the above questions, the African Commission notes that the concepts of\n\"peoples\" and \"indigenous peoples/communities\" are contested terms.46 As far as \"indigenous peoples\"are\nconcerned, there is no universal and unambiguous definition of the concept, since no single accepted\ndefinition captures the diversity of indigenous cultures, histories and current circumstances. The\nrelationships between indigenous peoples and dominant or mainstream groups in society vary from country\nto country. The same is true of the concept of \"peoples.\" The African Commission is thus aware of the\npolitical connotation that these concepts carry. Those controversies led the drafters of the African Charter\nto deliberately refrain from proposing any definitions for the notion of \"people(s).\"]>47 In its Report of the\nWorking Group of Experts on Indigenous Populations/Communities,48 the African Commission describes its\ndilemma of defining the concept of \"peoples\" in the following terms:\nDespite its mandate to interpret all provisions of the African Charter as per Article 45(3), the African\nCommission initially shied away from interpreting the concept of 'peoples'. The African Charter itself does\nnot define the concept. Initially the African Commission did not feel at ease in developing rights where there\nwas little concrete international jurisprudence. The ICCPR and the ICESR do not define 'peoples.' It is\nevident that the drafters of the African Charter intended to distinguish between the traditional individual\nrights where the sections preceding Article 17 make reference to \"every individual.\" Article 18 serves as a\nbreak by referring to the family. Articles 19 to 24 make specific reference to \"all peoples.\"\n148. The African Commission, nevertheless, notes that while the terms 'peoples' and 'indigenous\ncommunity' arouse emotive debates, some marginalised and vulnerable groups in Africa are suffering from\nparticular problems. It is aware that many of these groups have not been accommodated by dominating\ndevelopment paradigms and in many cases they are being victimised by mainstream development policies\nand thinking and their basic human rights violated. The African Commission is also aware that indigenous\npeoples have, due to past and ongoing processes, become marginalised in their own country and they\nneed recognition and protection of their basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n149. The African Commission also notes that normatively, the African Charter is an innovative and unique\nhuman rights document compared to other regional human rights instruments, in placing special emphasis\non the rights of \"peoples.\"49 It substantially departs from the narrow formulations of other regional and\nuniversal human rights instruments by weaving a tapestry which includes the three \"generations\" of rights:\ncivil and political rights; economic, social, and cultural rights; and group and peoples' rights. In that regard,\nthe African Commission notes its own observation that the term \"indigenous\" is also not intended to create\na special class of citizens, but rather to address historical and present-day injustices and inequalities. This\nis the sense in which the term has been applied in the African context by the Working Group on Indigenous\nPopulations/Communities of the African Commission.50 In the context of the African Charter, the Working\nGroup notes that the notion of \"peoples\" is closely related to collective rights.51\n150. The African Commission also notes that the African Charter, in Articles 20 through 24, provides for\npeoples to retain rights as peoples, that is, as collectives. 52 The African Commission through its Working\nGroup of Experts on Indigenous Populations/Communities has set out four criteria for identifying indigenous\npeoples. 53 These are: the occupation and use of a specific territory; the voluntary perpetuation of cultural\ndistinctiveness; self-identification as a distinct collectivity, as well as recognition by other groups; an\nexperience of subjugation, marginalisation, dispossession, exclusion or discrimination. The Working Group\nalso demarcated some of the shared characteristics of African indigenous groups:\n... first and foremost (but not exclusively) different groups of hunter-gatherers or former hunter-gatherers\nand certain groups of pastoralists... ??? A key characteristic for most of them is that the survival of their\nparticular way of life depends on access and rights to their traditional land and the natural resources\nthereon. 54\n151. The African Commission is thus aware that there is an emerging consensus on some objective\nfeatures that a collective of individuals should manifest to be considered as \"peoples\", viz: a common\nhistorical tradition, racial or ethnic identity, cultural homogeneity, linguistic unity, religious and ideological\n17\n\n\faffinities, territorial connection, and a common economic life or other bonds, identities and affinities they\ncollectively enjoy - especially rights enumerated under Articles 19 to 24 of the African Charter - or suffer\ncollectively from the deprivation of such rights. What is clear is that all attempts to define the concept of\nindigenous peoples recognise the linkages between peoples, their land, and culture and that such a group\nexpresses its desire to be identified as a people or have the consciousness that they are a people.55\n152. As far as the present matter is concerned, the African Commission is also enjoined under Article 61 of\nthe African Charter to be inspired by other subsidiary sources of international law or general principles in\ndetermining rights under the African Charter.56 It takes note of the working definition proposed by the UN\nWorking Group on Indigenous Populations:\n... that indigenous peoples are ...those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and\npre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of\nthe societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant\nsectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their\nancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in\naccordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems.57\n153. But this working definition should be read in conjunction with the 2003 Report of the African\nCommission's Working Group of Experts on Indigenous Populations/Communities, which is the basis of its\n'definition' of indigenous populations.58 Similarly it notes that the International Labour Organisation has\nproffered a definition of indigenous peoples in Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal\nPeoples in Independent Countries:59\nPeoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the\npopulations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time\nof conquest or colonization or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their\nlegal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions.60\n154. The African Commission is also aware that though some indigenous populations might be first\ninhabitants, validation of rights is not automatically afforded to such pre-invasion and pre-colonial claims. In\nterms of ILO Convention 169, even though many African countries have not signed and ratified the said\nConvention, and like the UN Working Groups' conceptualisation of the term, the African Commission notes\nthat there is a common thread that runs through all the various criteria that attempts to describe indigenous\npeoples - that indigenous peoples have an unambiguous relationship to a distinct territory and that all\nattempts to define the concept recognise the linkages between people, their land, and culture. In that\nregard, the African Commission notes the observation of the UN Special Rapporteur, where he states that\nin Kenya indigenous populations/communities include pastoralist communities such as the Endorois,61\nBorana, Gabra, Maasai, Pokot, Samburu, Turkana, and Somali, and hunter-gatherer communities whose\nlivelihoods remain connected to the forest, such as the Awer (Boni), Ogiek, Sengwer, or Yaaku. The UN\nSpecial Rapporteur further observed that the Endorois community have lived for centuries in their traditional\nterritory around Lake Bogoria, which was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1973.62\n155. In the present communication the African Commission wishes to emphasise that the Charter\nrecognises the rights of peoples.63 The Complainants argue that the Endorois are a people, a status that\nentitles them to benefit from provisions of the African Charter that protect collective rights. The Respondent\nState disagrees.64 The African Commission notes that the Constitution of Kenya, though incorporating the\nprinciple of non-discrimination and guaranteeing civil and political rights, does not recognise economic,\nsocial and cultural rights as such, as well as group rights. It further notes that the rights of indigenous\npastoralist and hunter-gatherer communities are not recognised as such in Kenya's constitutional and legal\nframework, and no policies or governmental institutions deal directly with indigenous issues. It also notes\nthat while Kenya has ratified most international human rights treaties and conventions, it has not ratified\nILO Convention No. 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, and it has withheld its\napproval of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples of the General Assembly.\n156. After studying all the submissions of the Complainants and the Respondent State, the African\nCommission is of the view that Endorois culture, religion, and traditional way of life are intimately\nintertwined with their ancestral lands - Lake Bogoria and the surrounding area. It agrees that Lake Bogoria\nand the Monchongoi Forest are central to the Endorois' way of life and without access to their ancestral\nland, the Endorois are unable to fully exercise their cultural and religious rights, and feel disconnected from\ntheir land and ancestors.\n18\n\n\f157. In addition to a sacred relationship to their land, self-identification is another important criterion for\ndetermining indigenous peoples.65 The UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\nof Indigenous People also supports self-identification as a key criterion for determining who is indeed\nindigenous.66 The African Commission is aware that today many indigenous peoples are still excluded from\nsociety and often even deprived of their rights as equal citizens of a state. Nevertheless, many of these\ncommunities are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral\nterritories and their ethnic identity. It accepts the arguments that the continued existence of indigenous\ncommunities as 'peoples' is closely connected to the possibility of them influencing their own fate and to\nliving in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and religious systems.67 The African\nCommission further notes that the Report of the African Commission's Working Group of Experts on\nIndigenous Populations/Communities (WGIP) emphasises that peoples' self-identification is an important\ningredient to the concept of peoples' rights as laid out in the Charter. It agrees that the alleged violations of\nthe African Charter by the Respondent State are those that go to the heart of indigenous rights - the right to\npreserve one's identity through identification with ancestral lands, cultural patterns, social institutions and\nreligious systems. The African Commission, therefore, accepts that self-identification for Endorois as\nindigenous individuals and acceptance as such by the group is an essential component of their sense of\nidentity.68\n158. Furthermore, in drawing inspiration from international law on human and peoples' rights, the African\nCommission notes that the IACtHR has dealt with cases of self-identification where Afro-descendent\ncommunities were living in a collective manner, and had, for over 2-3 centuries, developed an ancestral link\nto their land. Moreover, the way of life of these communities depended heavily on the traditional use of their\nland, as did their cultural and spiritual survival due to the existence of ancestral graves on these lands.69\n159. The African Commission notes that while it has already accepted the existence of indigenous peoples\nin Africa through its WGIP reports, and through the adoption of its Advisory Opinion on the UN Declaration\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, it notes the fact that the Inter-American Court has not hesitated in\ngranting the collective rights protection to groups beyond the \"narrow/aboriginal/pre-Colombian\"\nunderstanding of indigenous peoples traditionally adopted in the Americas. In that regard, the African\nCommission notes two relevant decisions from the IACtHR: Moiwana v Suriname70 and Saramaka v\nSuriname. The Saramaka case is of particular relevance to the Endorois case, given the views expressed\nby the Respondent State during the oral hearings on the Merits.71\n160. In the Saramaka case, according to the evidence submitted by the Complainants, the Saramaka\npeople are one of six distinct Maroon groups in Suriname whose ancestors were African slaves forcibly\ntaken to Suriname during the European colonisation in the 17th century. The IACtHR considered that the\nSaramaka people make up a tribal community whose social, cultural and economic characteristics are\ndifferent from other sections of the national community, particularly because of their special relationship\nwith their ancestral territories, and because they regulate themselves, at least partially, by their own norms,\ncustoms, and/or traditions.\n161. Like the State of Suriname, the Respondent State (Kenya) in the instant communication is arguing that\nthe inclusion of the Endorois in 'modern society' has affected their cultural distinctiveness, such that it\nwould be difficult to define them as a distinct group that is very different from the Tugen sub-tribe or indeed\nthe larger Kalenjin tribe, that is, the Respondent State is questioning whether the Endorois can be defined\nin a way that takes into account the different degrees to which various members of the Endorois community\nadhere to traditional laws, customs, and economy, particularly those living within the Lake Bogoria area. In\nthe Saramaka case, the IACtHR disagreed with the State of Suriname that the Saramaka could not be\nconsidered a distinct group of people just because a few members do not identify with the larger group. In\nthe instant case, the African Commission, from all the evidence submitted to it, is satisfied that the Endorois\ncan be defined as a distinct tribal group whose members enjoy and exercise certain rights, such as the right\nto property, in a distinctly collective manner from the Tugen sub-tribe or indeed the larger Kalenjin tribe.\n162. The IACtHR also noted that the fact that some individual members of the Saramaka community may\nlive outside of the traditional Saramaka territory and in a way that may differ from other Saramakas who live\nwithin the traditional territory and in accordance with Saramaka customs does not affect the distinctiveness\nof this tribal group, nor its communal use and enjoyment of their property. In the case of the Endorois, the\nAfrican Commission is of the view that the question of whether certain members of the community may\nassert certain communal rights on behalf of the group is a question that must be resolved by the Endorois\nthemselves in accordance with their own traditional customs and norms and not by the State. The Endorois\ncannot be denied a right to juridical personality just because there is a lack of individual identification with\n19\n\n\fthe traditions and laws of the Endorois by some members of the community.\nFrom all the evidence (both oral and written and video testimony) submitted to the African Commission, the\nAfrican Commission agrees that the Endorois are an indigenous community and that they fulfil the criterion\nof 'distinctiveness.' The African Commission agrees that the Endorois consider themselves to be a distinct\npeople, sharing a common history, culture and religion. The African Commission is satisfied that the\nEndorois are a \"people\", a status that entitles them to benefit from provisions of the African Charter that\nprotect collective rights. The African Commission is of the view that the alleged violations of the African\nCharter are those that go to the heart of indigenous rights - the right to preserve one's identity through\nidentification with ancestral lands.\nAlleged Violation of Article 8\n\n163. The Complainants allege that Endorois' right to freely practice their religion has been violated by the\nRespondent State's action of evicting the Endorois from their land, and refusing them access to Lake\nBogoria and other surrounding religious sites. They further allege that the Respondent State's has\ninterfered with the Endorois' ability to practice and worship as their faith dictates; that religious sites within\nthe game reserve have not been properly demarcated and protected and since their eviction from the Lake\nBogoria area, the Endorois have not been able to freely practice their religion. They claim that access as of\nright for religious rituals - such as circumcisions, marital rituals, and initiation rights - has been denied the\ncommunity. Similarly, they state that the Endorois have not been able to hold or participate in their most\nsignificant annual religious ritual, which occurs when the lake undergoes seasonal changes.\n164. The Complainants further argue that the Endorois have neither been able to practice the prayers and\nceremonies that are intimately connected to the lake, nor have they been able to freely visit the spiritual\nhome of all Endorois, living and dead. They argue that the Endorois' spiritual beliefs and ceremonial\npractices constitute a religion under international law. They point out that the term \"religion\" in international\nhuman rights instruments covers various religious and spiritual beliefs and should be broadly interpreted.\nThey argue that the HRC states that the right to freedom of religion in the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights (ICCPR):\nprotects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief.\nThe terms 'belief' and 'religion' are to be broadly construed. Article 18 is not limited in its application to\ntraditional religions or to religions and beliefs with institutional characteristics or practices analogous to\nthose of traditional religions.72\nTo rebut the allegation of a violation of Article 8 of the African Charter, the Respondent State argues that\nthe Complainants have failed to show that the action of the government to gazette the game reserve for\npurposes of conserving the environment and wildlife and to a great extent the Complainants' cultural\ngrounds fails the test of the Constitution of reasonableness and justifiability. It argues that through the\ngazetting of various areas as protected areas, National Parks or Game Reserves or falling under the\nNational Museums, it has been possible to conserve some of the areas which are threatened by\nencroachment due to modernisation. The Respondent State argues that some of these areas include\n'Kayas' (forests used as religious ritual grounds by communities from the coast province of Kenya) which\nhas been highly effective while the communities have continued to access these grounds without fear of\nencroachment.\n165. Before deciding whether the Respondent State has indeed violated Article 8 of the Charter, the\nCommission wishes to establish whether the Endorois' spiritual beliefs and ceremonial practices constitute\na religion under the African Charter and international law. In that regard, the African Commission notes the\nobservation of the HRC in paragraph 164 (above). It is of the view that freedom of conscience and religion\nshould, among other things, mean the right to worship, engage in rituals, observe days of rest, and wear\nreligious garb.73 The African Commission notes its own observation in Free Legal Assistance Group v.\nZaire, that it has held that the right to freedom of conscience allows for individuals or groups to worship or\nassemble in connection with a religion or belief, and to establish and maintain places for these purposes,\nas well as to celebrate ceremonies in accordance with the precepts of one's religion or belief.74\n166. This Commission is aware that religion is often linked to land, cultural beliefs and practices, and that\nfreedom to worship and engage in such ceremonial acts is at the centre of the freedom of religion. The\nEndorois' cultural and religious practices are centred around Lake Bogoria and are of prime significance to\n20\n\n\fall Endorois. During oral testimony, and indeed in the Complainants' written submission, this Commission's\nattention was drawn to the fact that religious sites are situated around Lake Bogoria, where the Endorois\npray and where religious ceremonies regularly take place. It takes into cognisance that Endorois' ancestors\nare buried near the lake, and has already above, Lake Bogoria is considered the spiritual home of all\nEndorois, living and dead.\n167. It further notes that one of the beliefs of the Endorois is that their Great Ancestor, Dorios, came from\nthe Heavens and settled in the Mochongoi Forest.75 It notes the Complainants' arguments, which have not\nbeen contested by the Respondent State that the Endorois believe that each season the water of the Lake\nturns red and the hot springs emit a strong odour, signalling a time that the community performs traditional\nceremonies to appease the ancestors who drowned with the formation of the Lake.\n168. From the above analysis, the African Commission is of the view that the Endorois spiritual beliefs and\nceremonial practices constitute a religion under the African Charter.\n169. The African Commission will now determine whether the Respondent State by its actions or inactions\nhave interfered with the Endorois' right to religious freedom.\n170. The Respondent State has not denied that the Endorois' have been removed from their ancestral land\nthey call home. The Respondent State has merely advanced reasons why the Endorois can no longer stay\nwithin the Lake Bogoria area. The Complainants argue that the Endorois' inability to practice their religion is\na direct result of their expulsion from their land and that since their eviction the Endorois have not been\nable to freely practice their religion, as access for religious rituals has been denied the community.\n171. It is worth noting that in Amnesty International v. Sudan, the African Commission recognised the\ncentrality of practice to religious freedom.76 The African Commission noted that the State Party violated the\nauthors' right to practice their religion, because non-Muslims did not have the right to preach or build their\nchurches and were subjected to harassment, arbitrary arrest, and expulsion. The African Commission also\nnotes the case of Loren Laroye Riebe Star from the IACmHR, which determined that expulsion from lands\ncentral to the practice of religion constitutes a violation of religious freedoms. It notes that the Court held\nthat the expulsion of priests from the Chiapas area was a violation of the right to associate freely for\nreligious purposes.77\n172. The African Commission agrees that in some situations it may be necessary to place some form of\nlimited restrictions on a right protected by the African Charter. But such a restriction must be established by\nlaw and must not be applied in a manner that would completely vitiate the right. It notes the\nrecommendation of the HRC that limitations may be applied only for those purposes for which they were\nprescribed and must be directly related and proportionate to the specific need on which they are\npredicated.78 The raison d'?tre for a particularly harsh limitation on the right to practice religion, such as that\nexperienced by the Endorois, must be based on exceptionally good reasons, and it is for the Respondent\nState to prove that such interference is not only proportionate to the specific need on which they are\npredicated, but is also reasonable. In the case of Amnesty International v. Sudan, the African Commission\nstated that a wide-ranging ban on Christian associations was \"disproportionate to the measures required by\nthe government to maintain public order, security, and safety.\" The African Commission further went on to\nstate that any restrictions placed on the rights to practice one's religion should be negligible. In the above\nmentioned case, the African Commission decided that complete and total expulsion from the land for\nreligious ceremonies is not minimal.79\n173. The African Commission is of the view that denying the Endorois access to the Lake is a restriction on\ntheir freedom to practice their religion, a restriction not necessitated by any significant public security\ninterest or other justification. The African Commission is also not convinced that removing the Endorois\nfrom their ancestral land was a lawful action in pursuit of economic development or ecological protection.\nThe African Commission is of the view that allowing the Endorois to use the land to practice their religion\nwould not detract from the goal of conservation or developing the area for economic reasons.\nThe African Commission therefore finds against the Respondent State a violation of Article 8 of the African\nCharter. The African Commission is of the view that the Endorois' forced eviction from their ancestral lands\nby the Respondent State interfered with the Endorois' right to religious freedom and removed them from the\nsacred grounds essential to the practice of their religion, and rendered it virtually impossible for the\ncommunity to maintain religious practices central to their culture and religion. The African Commission is of\nthe view that the limitations placed on the State's duties to protect rights should be viewed in light of the\nunderlying sentiments of the African Charter. This was the view of the Commission, in Amnesty\nInternational v. Zambia, where it noted that the 'claw-back' clauses must not be interpreted against the\n21\n\n\fprinciples of the Charter ... and that recourse to these should not be used as a means of giving credence to\nviolations of the express provisions of the Charter.\"80\nAlleged Violation of Article 14\n\n174. The Complainants argue that the Endorois community have a right to property with regard to their\nancestral land, the possessions attached to it, and their cattle. The Respondent State denies the allegation.\n175. The Respondent State further argues that the land in question fell under the definition of Trust Land\nand was administered by the Baringo County Council for the benefit of all the people who were ordinarily\nresident in their jurisdiction which comprised mainly the four Tugen tribes. It argues that Trust Land is not\nonly established under the Constitution of Kenya and administered under an act of Parliament, but that the\nConstitution of Kenya provides that Trust Land may be alienated through registration to another person\nother than the County Council; an Act of Parliament providing for the County Council to set apart an area of\nTrust Land vested in it for use and occupation of public body or authority for public purposes; person or\npersons or purposes which, in the opinion of the Council, is likely to benefit the persons ordinarily resident\nin that area; by the President in consultation with the Council. It argues that Trust Land may be set apart as\ngovernment land for government purposes or private land.\n176. The Respondent State argues that when Trust Land is set apart for whatever purpose, the interest or\nother benefits in respect of that land that was previously vested in any tribe, group, family or individual\nunder African customary law are extinguished. It, however, states that the Constitution and the Trust Land\nAct provide for adequate and prompt compensation for all residents. The Respondent State, in both its oral\nand written submissions, is arguing that the Trust Land Act provides a comprehensive procedure for\nassessment of compensation where the Endorois should have applied to the District Commissioner and\nlodged an appeal if they were dissatisfied. The Respondent State further argues that the Endorois have a\nright of access to the High Court of Kenya by the Constitution to determine whether their rights have been\nviolated.\n177. According to the Respondent State, with the creation of more local authorities, the land in question\nnow comprises parts of Baringo and Koibatek County Councils, and through Gazette Notice No 239 of\n1973, the land was first set apart as Lake Hannington Game Reserve, which was later revoked by Gazette\nNotice No 270 of 1974, where the Game Reserve was renamed Lake Baringo Game Reserve, and the\nboundaries and purpose of setting apart this area specified in the Gazette Notices as required by the Trust\nLand Act. It argues that the Government offered adequate and prompt compensation to the affected\npeople, \"a fact which the Applicants agree with.\"81\n178. In its oral and written testimonies, the Respondent State argues that the gazettement of a game\nreserve under the wildlife laws of Kenya is with the objective of ensuring that wildlife is managed and\nconserved to yield to the nation in general and to individual areas in particular optimum returns in terms of\ncultural, aesthetic and scientific gains as well as economic gains as are incidental to proper wildlife\nmanagement and conservation. The Respondent State also argues that national reserves unlike national\nparks, where the act expressly excludes human interference save for instances where one has got\nauthorisation, are subject to agreements as to restrictions or conditions relating to the provisions of the area\ncovered by the reserve. It also states that communities living around the national reserves have in some\ninstances been allowed to drive their cattle to the reserve for the purposes of grazing, so long as they do\nnot cause harm to the environment and the natural habitats of the wild animals. It states that with the\nestablishment of a national reserve particularly from Trust Land, it is apparent that the community's right of\naccess is not extinguished, but rather its propriety right as recognised under the law (that is, the right to\ndeal with property as it pleases) is the one which is minimised and hence the requirement to compensate\nthe affected people.\n179. Rebutting the claim of the Complainants that the Kenyan authorities prevented them from occupying\ntheir other ancestral land, Muchongoi Forest, the Respondent State argued that the land in question was\ngazetted as a forest in 1941, by the name of Ol Arabel Forest, which means that the land ceased being\ncommunal land by virtue of the gazettement. It states that some excisions have been made from the Ol\nArablel Forest to create the Muchongoi Settlement Scheme to settle members of the four Tungen tribes of\nthe Baringo district, one of which is the Endorois.\n180. The Respondent State also argues that it has also gone a step further to formulate \"Rules\", namely\nthe \"The Forests (Tugen-Kamasia) Rules\" to enable the inhabitants of the Baringo Duistrict, including the\nEndorois to enjoy some privileges through access to the Ol Arabel Forest for some purposes. The Rules, it\n22\n\n\fstates, allow the community to collect dead wood for firewood, pick wild berries and fruits, take or collect\nthe bark of dead trees for thatching beehives, cut and remove creepers and lianes for building purposes,\ntake stock, including goats, to such watering places within the Central Forests as may be approved by the\nDistrict Commissioner in consultation with the Forest Officer, enter the Forest for the purpose of holding\ncustomary ceremonies and rites, but no damage shall be done to any tree, graze sheep within the Forest,\ngraze cattle for specified periods during the dry season with the written permission of the District\nCommissioner or the Forest Officer and to retain or construct huts within the Forest by approved forest\ncultivators among others.\n181. The Respondent State argues further that the above Rules ensure that the livelihoods of the\ncommunity are not compromised by the gazettement, in the sense that the people could obtain food and\nbuilding materials, as well as run some economic activities such as beekeeping and grazing livestock in the\nForest. They also say they were at liberty to practice their religion and culture. Further, it states that the due\nprocess of law regarding compensation was followed at the time of the said gazettement.\n182. Regarding the issue of dispossession of ancestral land in the alleged Mochongoi Forest, the\nRespondent State did not address it, as it argues that it was not part of the matters addressed by the High\nCourt case, and therefore the African Commission would be acting as a tribunal of first instance if it did so.\n183. The Respondent State does not dispute that the Lake Bogoria area of the Baringo and Koibatek\nAdministrative Districts is the Endorois' ancestral land. One of the issues the Respondent State is disputing\nis whether the Endorois are indeed a distinct Community. That question has already been answered supra.\nIn para 1.1.6 of the Respondent State Mmerits brief, the State said: \"Following the Declaration of the Lake\nBogoria Game Reserve, the Government embarked on a resettlement exercise, culminating in the\nresettlement of the majority of the Endorois in the Mochongoi settlement scheme. This was over and above\nthe compensation paid to the Endorois after their ancestral land around lake was gazetted.82\n184. It is thus clear that the land surrounding Lake Bogoria is the traditional land of the Endorois people. In\npara 1 of the Merits brief, submitted by the Complainants, they write: \"The Endorois are a community of\napproximately 60, 000 people who, from time immemorial, have lived in the Lake Bogoria area of the\nBaringo and Koibatek Administrative Districts.\" 83 In para 47, the Complainants also state that: \"For\ncenturies the Endorois have constructed homes on the land, cultivated the land, enjoyed unchallenged\nrights to pasture, grazing, and forest land, and relied on the land to sustain their livelihoods.\" The\nComplainants argue that apart from a confrontation with the Masai over the Lake Bogoria region three\nhundred years ago, the Endorois have been accepted by all neighbouring tribes, including the British\nCrown, as bona fide owners of their land. The Respondent State does not challenge those statements of\nthe Complainants. The only conclusion that could be reached is that the Endorois community has a right to\nproperty with regard to its ancestral land, the possessions attached to it, and their animals.\n185. Two issues that should be disposed of before going into the more substantive questions of whether\nthe Respondent State has violated Article 14 are a determination of what is a 'property right' (within the\ncontext of indigenous populations) that accords with African and international law, and whether special\nmeasures are needed to protect such rights, if they exist and whether Endorois' land has been encroached\nupon by the Respondent State. The Complainants argue that \"property rights\" have an autonomous\nmeaning under international human rights law, which supersedes national legal definitions. They state that\nboth the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and IACtHR have examined the specific facts of\nindividual situations to determine what should be classified as 'property rights', particularly for displaced\npersons, instead of limiting themselves to formal requirements in national law.84\n186. To determine that question, the African Commission will look, first, at its own jurisprudence and then at\ninternational case law. In Malawi African Association and Others v. Mauritania, land was considered\n'property' for the purposes of Article 14 of the Charter.85 The African Commission in the Ogoni case also\nfound that the 'right to property' includes not only the right to have access to one's property and not to have\none's property invaded or encroached upon,86 but also the right to undisturbed possession, use and control\nof such property however the owner(s) deem fit.87 The African Commission also notes that the ECHR have\nrecognised that 'property rights' could also include the economic resources and rights over the common\nland of the applicants. 88\n187. The Complainants argue that both international and domestic courts have recognised that indigenous\ngroups have a specific form of land tenure that creates a particular set of problems. Common problems\nfaced by indigenous groups include the lack of \"formal\" title recognition of their historic territories, the failure\nof domestic legal systems to acknowledge communal property rights, and the claiming of formal legal title\n23\n\n\fto indigenous land by the colonial authorities. This, they argue, has led to many cases of displacement from\na people's historic territory, both by colonial authorities and post-colonial states relying on the legal title they\ninherited from the colonial authorities. The African Commission notes that its Working Group on Indigenous\nPopulations/Communities has recognised that some African minorities do face dispossession of their lands\nand that special measures are necessary in order to ensure their survival in accordance with their traditions\nand customs.89 The African Commission is of the view that the first step in the protection of traditional\nAfrican communities is the acknowledgement that the rights, interests and benefits of such communities in\ntheir traditional lands constitute 'property' under the Charter and that special measures may have to be\ntaken to secure such 'property rights'.\n188. The case of Dogan and others v Turkey90 is instructive in the instant communication. Although the\napplicants were unable to demonstrate registered title of lands from which they had been forcibly evicted by\nthe Turkish authorities, the European Court of Human Rights observed that:\n[T]he notion 'possessions' in Article 1 has an autonomous meaning which is certainly not limited to\nownership of physical goods: certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as\n'property rights', and thus as 'possessions' for the purposes of this provision.91\n189. Although they did not have registered property, they either had their own houses constructed on the\nland of their ascendants or lived in the houses owned by their fathers and cultivate the land belonging to\nthe latter. The Court further noted that the applicants had unchallenged rights over the common land in the\nvillage, such as the pasture, grazing and the forest land, and that they earned their living from\nstockbreeding and tree-felling.\n190. The African Commission also notes the observation of the IActHR in the seminal case of The\nMayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni v Nicaragua,92 that the Inter-American Convention protected property rights\nin a sense which include the rights of members of the indigenous communities within the framework of\ncommunal property and argued that possession of the land should suffice for indigenous communities\nlacking real title to obtain official recognition of that property.\n191. In the opinion of the African Commission, the Respondent State has an obligation under Article 14 of\nthe African Charter not only to respect the 'right to property', but also to protect that right. In 'the Mauritania\nCases',93 the African Commission concluded that the confiscation and pillaging of the property of black\nMauritanians and the expropriation or destruction of their land and houses before forcing them to go abroad\nconstituted a violation of the right to property as guaranteed in Article 14. Similarly, in The Ogoni case\n200194 the African Commission addressed factual situations involving removal of people from their homes.\nThe African Commission held that the removal of people from their homes violated Article 14 of the African\nCharter, as well as the right to adequate housing which, although not explicitly expressed in the African\nCharter, is also guaranteed by Article 14.95\n192. The Saramaka case also sets out how the failure to recognise an indigenous/tribal group becomes a\nviolation of the 'right to property.'96 In its analysis of whether the State of Suriname had adopted an\nappropriate framework to give domestic legal effect to the 'right to property', the IACtHR addressed the\nfollowing issues:\nThis controversy over who actually represents the Saramaka people is precisely a natural consequence of\nthe lack of recognition of their juridical personality.97\n193. In the Saramaka case, the State of Suriname did not recognise that the Saramaka people can enjoy\nand exercise property rights as a community. The Court observed that other communities in Suriname have\nbeen denied the right to seek judicial protection against alleged violations of their collective property rights\nprecisely because a judge considered they did not have the legal capacity necessary to request such\nprotection. This, the Court opined, placed the Saramaka people in a vulnerable situation where individual\n'property rights' may trump their rights over communal property, and where the Saramaka people may not\nseek, as a juridical personality, judicial protection against violations of their 'property rights' recognised\nunder Article 21\n×\n• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n24\n\n\f• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the Convention.\n194. As is in the instant case before the African Commission, the State of Suriname acknowledged that its\ndomestic legal framework did not recognise the right of the members of the Saramaka people to the use\nand enjoyment of property in accordance with their system of communal property, but rather a privilege to\nuse land. It also went on to provide reasons, as to why it should not be held accountable for giving effect to\nthe Saramaka claims to a right to property, for example because the land tenure system of the Saramaka\npeople, particularly regarding who owns the land, presents a practical problem for state recognition of their\nright to communal property. The IACtHR rejected all of the State's arguments. In the present\ncommunication, the High Court of Kenya similarly dismissed any claims based on historic occupation and\ncultural rights.98\n195. The IACtHR went further to say that, in any case, the alleged lack of clarity as to the land tenure\nsystem of the Saramakas should not present an insurmountable obstacle for the State, which has the duty\nto consult with the members of the Saramaka people and seek clarification of this issue, in order to comply\nwith its obligations under Article 21\n×\n• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the Convention.\n196. In the present communication, the Respondent State (the Kenyan Government) during the oral\nhearings argued that legislation or special treatment in favour of the Endorois might be perceived as being\ndiscriminatory. The African Commission rejects that view. The African Commission is of the view that the\nRespondent State cannot abstain from complying with its international obligations under the African Charter\nmerely because it might be perceived to be discriminatory to do so. It is of the view that in certain cases,\npositive discrimination or affirmative action helps to redress imbalance. The African Commission shares the\nRespondent State's concern over the difficulty involved; nevertheless, the State still has a duty to recognise\nthe right to property of members of the Endorois community, within the framework of a communal property\nsystem, and establish the mechanisms necessary to give domestic legal effect to such right recognised in\nthe Charter and international law. Besides, it is a well established principle of international law that unequal\ntreatment towards persons in unequal situations does not necessarily amount to impermissible\ndiscrimination.99 Legislation that recognises said differences is therefore not necessarily discriminatory.\n197. Again drawing on the Saramaka v Suriname case, which confirms earlier jurisprudence of the\nMoiwana v Suriname, Yakye Axa v Paraguay100 , Sawhoyamaxa v Paraguay101 , and Mayagna Awas\nTingni v Nicaragua;102 the Saramaka case has held that Special measures of protection are owed to\nmembers of the tribal community to guarantee the full exercise of their rights. The IACtHR stated that\nbased on Article 1(1)\n× The States Parties to this Convention undertake to respect the rights and freedoms recognized herein\nand to ensure to all persons subject to their jurisdiction the free and full exercise of those rights and\nfreedoms, without any discrimination for reasons of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other\nopinion, national or social origin, economic status, birth, or any other social condition.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the Convention, members of indigenous and tribal communities require special measures that guarantee\nthe full exercise of their rights, particularly with regard to their enjoyment of 'property rights' in order to\nsafeguard their physical and cultural survival.\n198. Other sources of international law have similarly declared that such special measures are necessary.\nIn the Moiwana case, the IACtHR determined that another Maroon community living in Suriname was also\nnot indigenous to the region, but rather constituted a tribal community that settled in Suriname in the 17th\nand 18th century, and that this tribal community had \"a profound and all-encompassing relationship to their\n25\n\n\fancestral lands\" that was centred, not \"on the individual, but rather on the community as a whole.\" This\nspecial relationship to land, as well as their communal concept of ownership, prompted the Court to apply\nto the tribal Moiwana community its jurisprudence regarding indigenous peoples and their right to\ncommunal property under Article 21\n×\n• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the Convention.\n199. The African Commission is of the view that even though the Constitution of Kenya provides that Trust\nLand may be alienated and that the Trust Land Act provides comprehensive procedure for the assessment\nof compensation, the Endorois property rights have been encroached upon, in particular by the\nexpropriation and the effective denial of ownership of their land. It agrees with the Complainants that the\nEndorois were never given the full title to the land they had in practice before the British colonial\nadministration. Their land was instead made subject to a trust, which gave them beneficial title, but denied\nthem actual title. The African Commission further agrees that though for a decade they were able to\nexercise their traditional rights without restriction, the trust land system has proved inadequate to protect\ntheir rights.\n200. The African Commission also notes the views expressed by the Committee on Economic, Social and\nCultural Rights which has provided a legal test for forced removal from lands which is traditionally claimed\nby a group of people as their property. In its 'General Comment No. 4' it states that \"instances of forced\neviction are prima facie incompatible with the requirements of the Covenant and can only be justified in the\nmost exceptional circumstances, and in accordance with the relevant principles of international law.\"103\nThis view has also been reaffirmed by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights which states that\nforced evictions are a gross violations of human rights, and in particular the right to adequate housing.104\nThe African Commission also notes General Comment No. 7 requiring States Parties, prior to carrying out\nany evictions, to explore all feasible alternatives in consultation with affected persons, with a view to\navoiding, or at least minimizing, the need to use force.105\n201. The African Commission is also inspired by the European Commission of Human Rights. Article 1 of\nProtocol 1 to the European Convention\n× http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/009.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nstates:\nEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his [or her] possessions. No one shall\nbe deprived of his [or her] possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided\nfor by law and by the general principles of international law.106\n202. The African Commission also refers to Akdivar and Others v. Turkey. The European Court held that\nforced evictions constitute a violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention. Akdivar and\nOthers involved the destruction of housing in the context of the ongoing conflict between the Government of\nTurkey and Kurdish separatist forces. The petitioners were forcibly evicted from their properties, which\nwere subsequently set on fire and destroyed. It was unclear which party to the conflict was responsible.\nNonetheless, the European Court held that the Government of Turkey violated both Article 8 of the\nEuropean Convention and Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention because it has a duty to both\nrespect and protect the rights enshrined in the European Convention and its Protocols.\n203. In the instant case, the Respondent State sets out the conditions when Trust Land is set apart for\nwhatever purpose.107\n204. The African Commission notes that the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, officially\nsanctioned by the African Commission through its 2007 Advisory Opinion, deals extensively with land\nrights. The jurisprudence under international law bestows the right of ownership rather than mere access.\nThe African Commission notes that if international law were to grant access only, indigenous peoples would\nremain vulnerable to further violations/dispossession by the State or third parties. Ownership ensures that\n26\n\n\findigenous peoples can engage with the state and third parties as active stakeholders rather than as\npassive beneficiaries.108\n205. The Inter-American Court jurisprudence also makes it clear that mere access or de facto ownership of\nland is not compatible with principles of international law. Only de jure ownership can guarantee indigenous\npeoples' effective protection.109\n206. In the Saramaka case, the Court held that the State's legal framework merely grants the members of\nthe Saramaka people a privilege to use land, which does not guarantee the right to effectively control their\nterritory without outside interference. The Court held that, rather than a privilege to use the land, which can\nbe taken away by the State or trumped by real property rights of third parties, members of indigenous and\ntribal peoples must obtain title to their territory in order to guarantee its permanent use and enjoyment. This\ntitle must be recognised and respected not only in practice but also in law in order to ensure its legal\ncertainty. In order to obtain such title, the territory traditionally used and occupied by the members of the\nSaramaka people must first be delimited and demarcated, in consultation with such people and other\nneighbouring peoples. The situation of the Endorois is not different. The Respondent State simply wants to\ngrant them privileges such as restricted access to ceremonial sites. This, in the opinion of the Commission,\nfalls below internationally recognised norms. The Respondent State must grant title to their territory in order\nto guarantee its permanent use and enjoyment.\n207. The African Commission notes that that Articles 26\n×\n• Indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources which they have\ntraditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired.\n• Indigenous peoples have the right to own, use, develop and control the lands, territories and\nresources that they possess by reason of traditional ownership or other traditional occupation or\nuse, as well as those which they have otherwise acquired.\n• States shall give legal recognition and protection to these lands, territories and resources. Such\nrecognition shall be conducted with due respect to the customs, traditions and land tenure systems\nof the indigenous peoples concerned.\nhttp://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement and 27\n× \"States shall establish and implement, in conjunction with indigenous peoples concerned, a fair,\nindependent, impartial, open and transparent process, giving due recognition to indigenous peoples' laws,\ntraditions, customs and land tenure systems, to recognize and adjudicate the rights of indigenous peoples\npertaining to their lands, territories and resources, including those which were traditionally owned or\notherwise occupied or used. Indigenous peoples shall have the right to participate in this\nprocess.\"http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement\naccessed 26.10.2010\nof the UN Declaration on Indigenous Peoples use the term \"occupied or otherwise used.\" This is to stress\nthat indigenous peoples have a recognised claim to ownership to ancestral land under international law,\neven in the absence of official title deeds. This was made clear in the judgment of Awas Tingni v Nicaragua\n. In the current leading international case on this issue, The Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni v Nicaragua ,110\nthe IActHR recognised that the Inter-American Convention protected property rights \"in a sense which\nincludes, among others, the rights of members of the indigenous communities within the framework of\ncommunal property.\"111 It stated that possession of the land should suffice for indigenous communities\nlacking real title to obtain official recognition of that property.112\n208. The African Commission also notes that in the case of Sawhoyamaxa v Paraguay, the IActHR, acting\nwithin the scope of its adjudicatory jurisdiction, decided on indigenous land possession in three different\nsituations, viz: in the Case of the Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni Community, the Court pointed out that\npossession of the land should suffice for indigenous communities lacking real title to property of the land to\nobtain official recognition of that property, and for consequent registration;113 in the Case of the Moiwana\nCommunity, the Court considered that the members of the N'djuka people were the \"legitimate owners of\ntheir traditional lands\", although they did not have possession thereof, because they left them as a result of\nthe acts of violence perpetrated against them, though in this case, the traditional lands were not occupied\nby third parties.114 Finally, in the Case of the Indigenous Community Yakye Axa , the Court considered that\nthe members of the community were empowered, even under domestic law, to file claims for traditional\n27\n\n\flands and ordered the State, as measure of reparation, to individualise those lands and transfer them on a\nno consideration basis.115\n209. In the view of the African Commission, the following conclusions could be drawn: (1) traditional\npossession of land by indigenous people has the equivalent effect as that of a state-granted full property\ntitle; (2) traditional possession entitles indigenous people to demand official recognition and registration of\nproperty title; (3) the members of indigenous peoples who have unwillingly left their traditional lands, or lost\npossession thereof, maintain property rights thereto, even though they lack legal title, unless the lands have\nbeen lawfully transferred to third parties in good faith; and (4) the members of indigenous peoples who\nhave unwillingly lost possession of their lands, when those lands have been lawfully transferred to innocent\nthird parties, are entitled to restitution thereof or to obtain other lands of equal extension and quality.\nConsequently, possession is not a requisite condition for the existence of indigenous land restitution rights.\nThe instant case of the Endorois is categorised under this last conclusion. The African Commission thus\nagrees that the land of the Endorois has been encroached upon.\n210. That such encroachment has taken place could be seen by the Endorois' inability, after being evicted\nfrom their ancestral land, to have free access to religious sites and their traditional land to graze their cattle.\nThe African Commission is aware that access roads, gates, game lodges and a hotel have all been built on\nthe ancestral land of the Endorois community around Lake Bogoria and imminent mining operations also\nthreatens to cause irreparable damage to the land. The African Commission has also been notified that the\nRespondent State is engaged in the demarcation and sale of parts of Endorois historic lands to third\nparties.\n211. The African Commission is aware that encroachment in itself is not a violation of Article 14 of the\nCharter, as long as it is done in accordance with the law. Article 14 of the African Charter indicates a\ntwo-pronged test, where that encroachment can only be conducted - 'in the interest of public need or in the\ngeneral interest of the community' and 'in accordance with appropriate laws'. The African Commission will\nnow assess whether an encroachment 'in the interest of public need' is indeed proportionate to the point of\noverriding the rights of indigenous peoples to their ancestral lands. The African Commission agrees with\nthe Complainants that the test laid out in Article 14 of the Charter is conjunctive, that is, in order for an\nencroachment not to be in violation of Article 14, it must be proven that the encroachment was in the\ninterest of the public need/general interest of the community and was carried out in accordance with\nappropriate laws.\n212. The 'public interest' test is met with a much higher threshold in the case of encroachment of\nindigenous land rather than individual private property. In this sense, the test is much more stringent when\napplied to ancestral land rights of indigenous peoples. In 2005, this point was stressed by the Special\nRapporteur of the United Nations Sub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights who\npublished the following statement:\nLimitations, if any, on the right to indigenous peoples to their natural resources must flow only from the\nmost urgent and compelling interest of the state. Few, if any, limitations on indigenous resource rights are\nappropriate, because the indigenous ownership of the resources is associated with the most important and\nfundamental human rights, including the right to life, food, the right to self-determination, to shelter, and the\nright to exist as a people.116\n213. Limitations on rights, such as the limitation allowed in 14, must be reviewed under the principle of\nproportionality. The Commission notes its own conclusions that \"... the justification of limitations must be\nstrictly proportionate with and absolutely necessary for the advantages which follow.117 The African\nCommission also notes the decisive case of Handyside v. United Kingdom, where the ECHR stated that\nany condition or restriction imposed upon a right must be \"proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\"118\n214. The African Commission is of the view that any limitations on rights must be proportionate to a\nlegitimate need, and should be the least restrictive measures possible. In the present communication, the\nAfrican Commission holds the view that in the pursuit of creating a game reserve, the Respondent State\nhas unlawfully evicted the Endorois from their ancestral land and destroyed their possessions. It is of the\nview that the upheaval and displacement of the Endorois from the land they call home and the denial of\ntheir property rights over their ancestral land is disproportionate to any public need served by the game\nreserve.\n215. It is also of the view that even if the game reserve was a legitimate aim and served a public need, it\ncould have been accomplished by alternative means proportionate to the need. From the evidence\nsubmitted both orally and in writing, it is clear that the community was willing to work with the Government\n28\n\n\fin a way that respected their property rights, even if a game reserve was being created. In that regard, the\nAfrican Commission notes its own conclusion in the Constitutional Rights Project Case, where it says that\n\"a limitation may not erode a right such that the right itself becomes illusory.\"119 At the point where such a\nright becomes illusory, the limitation cannot be considered proportionate - the limitation becomes a violation\nof the right. The African Commission agrees that the Respondent State has not only denied the Endorois\ncommunity all legal rights in their ancestral land, rendering their property rights essentially illusory, but in\nthe name of creating a game reserve and the subsequent eviction of the Endorois community from their\nown land, the Respondent State has violated the very essence of the right itself, and cannot justify such an\ninterference with reference to \"the general interest of the community\" or a >\n216. The African Commission notes that the link to the right to life, in paragraph 219 above, is particularly\nnotable, as it is a non-derogable right under international law. Incorporating the right to life into the\nthreshold of the 'public interest test' is further confirmed by jurisprudence of the IActHR. In Yakye Axa v\nParaguay the Court found that the fallout from forcibly dispossessing indigenous peoples from their\nancestral land could amount to an Article 4 violation (right to life) if the living conditions of the community\nare incompatible with the principles of human dignity.\n217. The IActHR held that one of the obligations that the State must inescapably undertake as guarantor to\nprotect and ensure the right to life is that of generating minimum living conditions that are compatible with\nthe dignity of the human person and of not creating conditions that hinder or impede it. In this regard, the\nState has the duty to take positive, concrete measures geared towards fulfilment of the right to a decent\nlife, especially in the case of persons who are vulnerable and at risk, whose care becomes a high priority.\n218. The African Commission also notes that the 'disproportionate' nature of an encroachment on\nindigenous lands - therefore falling short of the test set out by the provisions of Article 14 of the African\nCharter - is to be considered an even greater violation of Article 14, when the displacement at hand was\nundertaken by force. Forced evictions, by their very definition, cannot be deemed to satisfy Article 14 of the\nCharter's test of being done 'in accordance with the law'. This provision must mean, at the minimum, that\nboth Kenyan law and the relevant provisions of international law were respected. The grave nature of\nforced evictions could amount to a gross violation of human rights. Indeed, the United Nations Commission\non Human Rights, in Resolutions 1993/77 and 2004/28, has reaffirmed that forced evictions amount to a\ngross violations of human rights and in particular the right to adequate housing.\"120 Where such removal\nwas forced, this would in itself suggest that the 'proportionality' test has not been satisfied.\n219. With respect to the 'in accordance with the law' test, the Respondent State should also be able to\nshow that the removal of the Endorois was not only in the public interest, but their removal satisfied both\nKenyan and international law. If it is settled that there was a trust in favour of the Endorois, was it legally\nextinguished? If it was, how was it satisfied? Was the community adequately compensated? Also, did the\nrelevant legislation creating the game reserve, expressly required the removal of the Endorois from their\nland?\n220. The African Commission notes that the Respondent State does not contest the claim that the\ntraditional lands of the Endorois people are classified as Trust Land. In fact S. 115 of the Kenyan\nConstitution gives effect to that claim. In the opinion of the African Commission it created a beneficial right\nfor the Endorois over their ancestral land. This should have meant that the County Council should give\neffect to such rights, interest or other benefits in respect of the land.\n221. The Complainants argue that the Respondent State created the Lake Hannington Game Reserve,\nincluding the Endorois indigenous lands, on 9 November 1973. The name was changed to Lake Bogoria\nGame Reserve in a second notice in 1974.121 The 1974 notice was made by the Kenyan Minister for\nTourism and Wildlife under the Wild Animals Protection Act (WAPA).122 The Complainants argue that\nWAPA applied to Trust Land as it did to any other land, and did not require that the land be taken out of the\nTrust before a game reserve could be declared over that land.\n222. They further argue that the relevant legislation did not give authority for the removal of any individual\nor group occupying the land in a game reserve. Instead, WAPA merely prohibited the hunting, killing or\ncapturing of animals within the game reserve.123 The Complainants argue that despite no clear legal order\nasking them to relocate to another land, the Endorois community was informed from 1973 onwards that\nthey would have to leave their ancestral lands.\n223. In rebuttal, the Respondent State argues that the Constitution of Kenya provides that Trust Land may\nbe alienated. It also states that the \"Government offered adequate and prompt compensation to the\naffected people... \"124 As regards the Complainants' claim that the Respondent State prevented the\nEndorois community from accessing their other ancestral lands, Muchongoi forest, the Respondent State\n29\n\n\fargues that the land in question was gazetted in 1941 by the name of Ol Arabel Forest with the implication\nthat the land ceased being communal by virtue of the gazettement.\n224. The African Commission agrees that WAPA merely prohibited the hunting, killing or capturing of\nanimals within the Game Reserve.125 Additionally, the Respondent State has not been able to prove\nwithout doubt that the eviction of the Endorois community satisfied both Kenyan and international law. The\nAfrican Commission is not convinced that the whole process of removing the Endorois from their ancestral\nland satisfied the very stringent international law provisions. Furthermore, the mere gazetting of Trust Land\nis not sufficient to legally extinguish the trust. WAPA should have required that the land be taken out of the\nTrust before a game reserve could be declared over that land. This means that the declaration of the Lake\nBogoria Game Reserve by way of the 1974 notice did not affect the status of the Endorois land as Trust\nLand. The obligation of Baringo and Koibatek County Councils to give effect to the rights and interests of\nthe Endorois people continued. That also has to be read in conjunction with the concept of adequate\ncompensation. The African Commission is in agreement with the Complainants that the only way under\nKenyan law in which Endorois benefit under the trust could have been dissolved is if the County Council or\nthe President of Kenya had \"set apart\" the land. However, the Trust Land Act required that to be legal, such\nsetting apart of the land must be published in the Kenyan Gazette.126\n225. Two further elements of the 'in accordance with the law' test relate to the requirements of consultation\nand compensation.\n226. In terms of consultation, the threshold is especially stringent in favour of indigenous peoples, as it also\nrequires that consent be accorded. Failure to observe the obligations to consult and to seek consent - or to\ncompensate - ultimately results in a violation of the right to property.\n227. In the Saramaka case, in order to guarantee that restrictions to the property rights of the members of\nthe Saramaka people by the issuance of concessions within their territory do not amount to a denial of their\nsurvival as a tribal people, the Court stated that the State must abide by the following three safeguards:\nfirst, ensure the effective participation of the members of the Saramaka people, in conformity with their\ncustoms and traditions, regarding any development, investment, exploration or extraction plan within\nSaramaka territory; second, guarantee that the Saramakas will receive a reasonable benefit from any such\nplan within their territory; third, ensure that no concession will be issued within Saramaka territory unless\nand until independent and technically capable entities, with the State's supervision, perform a prior\nenvironmental and social impact assessment. These safeguards are intended to preserve, protect and\nguarantee the special relationship that the members of the Saramaka community have with their territory,\nwhich in turn ensures their survival as a tribal people.\n228. In the instant case, the African Commission is of the view that no effective participation was allowed\nfor the Endorois, nor has there been any reasonable benefit enjoyed by the community. Moreover, a prior\nenvironment and social impact assessment was not carried out. The absence of these three elements of\nthe 'test' is tantamount to a violation of Article 14, the right to property, under the Charter. The failure to\nguarantee effective participation and to guarantee a reasonable share in the profits of the game reserve (or\nother adequate forms of compensation) also extends to a violation of the right to development.\n229. On the issue of compensation, the Respondent State in rebutting the Complainants' allegations that\ninadequate compensation was paid, argues that the Complainants do not contest that a form of\ncompensation was done, but that they have only pleaded that about 170 families were compensated. It\nfurther argues that, if at all the compensations paid was not adequate, the Trust Land Act provides for a\nprocedure for appeal, for the amount and the people who feel that they are denied compensation over their\ninterest.\n230. The Respondent State does not deny the Complainants' allegations that in 1986, of the 170 families\nevicted in late 1973, from their homes within the Lake Bogoria Game Reserve, each receiving around 3,150\nKshs (at the time, this was equivalent to approximately ?30). Such payment was made some 13 years after\nthe first eviction. It does not also deny the allegation that ?30 did not represent the market value of the land\ngazetted as Lake Bogoria Game Reserve. It also does not deny that the Kenyan authorities have\nthemselves recognised that the payment of 3,150 Kshs per family amounted only to 'relocation assistance',\nand does not constitute full compensation for loss of land.\n231. The African Commission is of the view that the Respondent State did not pay the prompt, full\ncompensation as required by the Constitution. It is of the view that Kenyan law has not been complied with\nand that though some members of the Endorois community accepted limited monetary compensation that\ndid not mean that they accepted it as full compensation, or indeed that they accepted the loss of their land.\n\n30\n\n\f232. The African Commission notes the observations of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of\nIndigenous Peoples, which, amongst other provisions for restitutions and compensations, states:\nIndigenous peoples have the right to restitution of the lands, territories and resources which they have\ntraditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used; and which have been confiscated, occupied, used or\ndamaged without their free and informed consent. Where this is not possible, they have the right to just and\nfair compensation. Unless otherwise freely agreed upon by the peoples concerned, compensation shall\ntake the form of lands, territories and resources equal in quality, size and legal status.127\n233. In the case of Yakye Axa v Paraguay the Court established that any violation of an international\nobligation that has caused damage entails the duty to provide appropriate reparations.128 To this end,\nArticle 63(1) of the American Convention\n×\nhttp://treaties.un.org/untc//Pages//doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201144/volume-1144-I-17955-English.pdf\naccessed 26.10.2010\nestablishes that:\nif the Court finds that there has been a violation of a right or freedom protected by th[e] Convention, the\nCourt shall rule that the injured party be ensured the enjoyment of his right or freedom that was violated. It\nshall also rule, if appropriate, that the consequences of the measure or situation that constituted the breach\nof such right or freedom be remedied and that fair compensation be paid to the injured party.\n234. The Court said that once it has been proved that land restitution rights are still current, the State must\ntake the necessary actions to return them to the members of the indigenous people claiming them.\nHowever, as the Court has pointed out, when a State is unable, on objective and reasonable grounds, to\nadopt measures aimed at returning traditional lands and communal resources to indigenous populations, it\nmust surrender alternative lands of equal extension and quality, which will be chosen by agreement with\nthe members of the indigenous peoples, according to their own consultation and decision procedures.129\nThis was not the case in respect of the Endorois. The land given them is not of equal quality.\n235. The reasons of the government in the instant communication are questionable for several reasons\nincluding:\n(a) the contested land is the site of a conservation area, and the Endorois - as the ancestral guardians of\nthat land - are best equipped to maintain its delicate ecosystems;\n(b) the Endorois are prepared to continue the conservation work begun by the Government;\n(c) no other community have settled on the land in question, and even if that is the case, the Respondent\nState is obliged to rectify that situation,130\n(d) the land has not been spoliated and is thus inhabitable;\n(e) continued dispossession and alienation from their ancestral land continues to threaten the cultural\nsurvival of the Endorois' way of life, a consequence which clearly tips the proportionality argument on the\nside of indigenous peoples under international law.\n236. It seems also to the African Commission that the amount of ?30 as compensation for one's ancestral\nhome land flies in the face of common sense and fairness.\n237. The African Commission notes the detailed recommendations regarding compensation payable to\ndisplaced or evicted persons developed by the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of\nDiscrimination and Protection of Minorities.131 These recommendations, which have been considered and\napplied by the European Court of Human Rights,132 set out the following principles for compensation on\nloss of land: Displaced persons should be\n(i) compensated for their losses at full replacement cost prior to the actual move;\n(ii) assisted with the move and supported during the transition period in the resettlement site; and\n(iii) assisted in their efforts to improve upon their former living standards, income earning capacity and\n31\n\n\fproduction levels, or at least to restore them. These recommendations could be followed if the Respondent\nState is interested in giving a fair compensation to the Endorois.\n238. Taking all the submissions of both parties, the African Commission agrees with the Complainants that\nthe Property of the Endorois people has been severely encroached upon and continues to be so\nencroached upon. The encroachment is not proportionate to any public need and is not in accordance with\nnational and international law. Accordingly, the African Commission finds for the Complainants that the\nEndorois as a distinct people have suffered a violation of Article 14 of the Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 17(2) and 17(3)\n\n239. The Complainants allege that the Endorois' cultural rights have been violated on two counts: first, the\ncommunity has faced systematic restrictions on access to cultural sites and, second, that the cultural rights\nof the community have been violated by the serious damage caused by the Kenyan authorities to their\npastoralist way of life.\n240. The Respondent State denies the allegation claiming that access to the forest areas was always\npermitted, subject to administrative procedures. The Respondent State also submits that in some instances\nsome communities have allowed political issues to be disguised as cultural practices and in the process\nthey endanger the peaceful coexistence with other communities. The Respondent State does not\nsubstantiate who these \"communities\" or what these \"political issues to be disguised as cultural practices\"\nare.\n241. The African Commission is of the view that protecting human rights goes beyond the duty not to\ndestroy or deliberately weaken minority groups, but requires respect for, and protection of, their religious\nand cultural heritage essential to their group identity, including buildings and sites such as libraries,\nchurches, mosques, temples and synagogues. Both the Complainants and the Respondent State seem to\nagree on that. It notes that Article 17 of the Charter is of a dual dimension in both its individual and\ncollective nature, protecting, on the one hand, individuals' participation in the cultural life of their community\nand, on the other hand, obliging the state to promote and protect traditional values recognised by a\ncommunity. It thus understands culture to mean that complex whole which includes a spiritual and physical\nassociation with one's ancestral land, knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, customs, and any other\ncapabilities and habits acquired by humankind as a member of society - the sum total of the material and\nspiritual activities and products of a given social group that distinguish it from other similar groups. It has\nalso understood cultural identity to encompass a group's religion, language, and other defining\ncharacteristics.133\n242. The African Commission notes that the preamble of the African Charter acknowledges that \"civil and\npolitical rights cannot be dissociated from economic, social and cultural rights ... social, cultural rights are a\nguarantee for the enjoyment of civil and political rights\", ideas which influenced the 1976 African Cultural\nCharter which in its preamble highlights >134 Article 3 of the same Charter states that culture is a source of\nmutual enrichment for various communities.135\n243. This Commission also notes the views of the Human Rights Committee with regard to the exercise of\nthe cultural rights protected under Article 27\n× of the [popup=UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and\nLinguistic Minorities] http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r135.htmaccessed 26.10.2010\n. The Committee observes that [quote]\"culture manifests itself in many forms, including a particular way of\nlife associated with the use of land resources, especially in the case of indigenous peoples. That right may\ninclude such traditional activities as fishing or hunting and the right to live in reserves protected by law. The\nenjoyment of those rights may require positive legal measures of protection and measures to ensure the\neffective participation of members of minority communities in decisions which affect them.\"136\n244. The African Commission notes that a common theme that usually runs through the debate about\nculture and its violation is the association with one's ancestral land. It notes that its own Working Group on\nIndigenous Populations/Communities has observed that dispossession of land and its resources is \"a major\nhuman rights problem for indigenous peoples.\"137 It further notes that a Report from the Working Group has\nalso emphasised that dispossession \"threatens the economic, social and cultural survival of indigenous\npastoralist and hunter-gatherer communities.\"138\n245. In the case of indigenous communities in Kenya, the African Commission notes the critical 'Report of\nthe Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous\nPeople in Kenya' that \"their livelihoods and cultures have been traditionally discriminated against and their\n32\n\n\flack of legal recognition and empowerment reflects their social, political and economic marginalization.\" 139\nHe also said that the principal human rights issues they face \"relate to the loss and environmental\ndegradation of their land, traditional forests and natural resources, as a result of dispossession in colonial\ntimes and in the post-independence period. In recent decades, inappropriate development and\nconservationist policies have aggravated the violation of their economic, social and cultural rights.\"140\n246. The African Commission is of the view that in its interpretation of the African Charter, it has recognised\nthe duty of the state to tolerate diversity and to introduce measures that protect identity groups different\nfrom those of the majority/dominant group. It has thus interpreted Article 17(2) as requiring governments to\ntake measures \"aimed at the conservation, development and diffusion of culture,\" such as promoting\n\"cultural identity as a factor of mutual appreciation among individuals, groups, nations and regions; . . .\npromoting awareness and enjoyment of cultural heritage of national ethnic groups and minorities and of\nindigenous sectors of the population.\"141\n247. The African Commission's WGIP has further highlighted the importance of creating spaces for\ndominant and indigenous cultures to co-exist. The WGIP notes with concern that: Indigenous communities\nhave in so many cases been pushed out of their traditional areas to give way for the economic interests of\nother more dominant groups and to large scale development initiatives that tend to destroy their lives and\ncultures rather than improve their situation.142\n248. The African Commission is of the opinion that the Respondent State has a higher duty in terms of\ntaking positive steps to protect groups and communities like the Endorois,143 but also to promote cultural\nrights including the creation of opportunities, policies, institutions, or other mechanisms that allow for\ndifferent cultures and ways of life to exist, develop in view of the challenges facing indigenous communities.\nThese challenges include exclusion, exploitation, discrimination and extreme poverty; displacement from\ntheir traditional territories and deprivation of their means of subsistence; lack of participation in decisions\naffecting the lives of the communities; forced assimilation and negative social statistics among other issues\nand, at times, indigenous communities suffer from direct violence and persecution, while some even face\nthe danger of extinction.144\n249. In its analysis of Article 17 of the African Charter, the African Commission is aware that unlike Articles\n8 and 14, Article 17 has no claw-back clause. The absence of a claw-back clause is an indication that the\ndrafters of the Charter envisaged few, if any, circumstances in which it would be appropriate to limit a\npeople's right to culture. It further notes that even if the Respondent State were to put some limitation on\nthe exercise of such a right, the restriction must be proportionate to a legitimate aim that does not interfere\nadversely on the exercise of a community's cultural rights. Thus, even if the creation of the game reserve\nconstitutes a legitimate aim, the Respondent State's failure to secure access, as of right, for the celebration\nof the cultural festival and rituals cannot be deemed proportionate to that aim. The Commission is of the\nview that the cultural activities of the Endorois community pose no harm to the ecosystem of the game\nreserve and the restriction of cultural rights could not be justified, especially as no suitable alternative was\ngiven to the community.\n250. It is the opinion of the African Commission that the Respondent State has overlooked that the\nuniversal appeal of great culture lies in its particulars and that imposing burdensome laws or rules on\nculture undermines its enduring aspects. The Respondent State has not taken into consideration the fact\nthat by restricting access to Lake Bogoria, it has denied the community access to an integrated system of\nbeliefs, values, norms, mores, traditions and artifacts closely linked to access to the Lake.\n251. By forcing the community to live on semi-arid lands without access to medicinal salt licks and other\nvital resources for the health of their livestock, the Respondent State have created a major threat to the\nEndorois pastoralist way of life. It is of the view that the very essence of the Endorois' right to culture has\nbeen denied, rendering the right, to all intents and purposes, illusory. Accordingly, the Respondent State is\nfound to have violated Article 17(2) and 17(3) of the Charter.\n\nAlleged Violation of Article 21\n\n252. The Complainants allege that the Endorois community has been unable to access the vital resources\nin the Lake Bogoria region since their eviction from the game reserve.\n253. The Respondent State denies the allegation. It argues that it is of the view that the Complainants have\nimmensely benefited from the tourism and mineral prospecting activities , noting for example:\n33\n\n\fa) Proceeds from the game reserve have been utilised to finance a number of projects in the area, such as\nschools, health facilities, wells and roads.\nb) Since the discovery of ruby minerals in the Weseges area near Lake Bogoria, three companies have\nbeen issued with prospecting licences, noting that two out of three companies belong to the community,\nincluding the Endorois. In addition, the company which does not consist of the locals, namely Corby Ltd,\nentered into an agreement with the community, binding itself to deliver some benefits to the latter in terms\nof supporting community projects. It states that it is evident (from the minutes of a meeting of the\ncommunity and the company) that the company is ready to undertake a project in the form of an access\nroad to the prospecting site for the community's and prospecting company's use.\nc) The Respondent State also argues that the mineral prospecting activities are taking place outside the\nLake Bogoria Game Reserve, which means that the land is not the subject matter of the Applicants'\ncomplaint.\n254. The Respondent State also argue that the community has been holding consultations with Corby Ltd.,\nas evidence by the agreement between them is a clear manifestation of the extent to which the former\nparticipants in the decisions touch on the exploitation of the natural resources and the sharing of the\nbenefits emanating therefrom.\n255. The African Commission notes that in The Ogoni case the right to natural resources contained within\ntheir traditional lands is also vested in the indigenous people, making it clear that a people inhabiting a\nspecific region within a state could also claim under Article 21 of the African Charter. 145 The Respondent\nState does not give enough evidence to substantiate the claim that the Complainants have immensely\nbenefited from the tourism and mineral prospecting activities.\n256. The African Commission notes that proceeds from the game reserve have been used to finance a lot\nof useful projects, 'a fact' that the Complainants do not contest. The African Commission, however, refers to\ncases in the Inter-American Human Rights system to understand this area of the law. The American\nConvention does not have an equivalent of the African Charter's Article 21 on the Right to Natural\nResources. It therefore reads the right to natural resources into the right to property (Article 21\n×\n• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the American Convention), and in turn applies similar limitation rights on the issue of natural resources\nas it does on limitations of the right to property. The \"test\" in both cases makes for a much higher threshold\nwhen potential spoliation or development of the land is affecting indigenous land.\n257. In the Saramaka case and Inter-American case law, an issue that flows from the IActHR assertion that\nthe members of the Saramaka people have a right to use and enjoy their territory in accordance with their\ntraditions and customs is the issue of the right to the use and enjoyment of the natural resources that lie on\nand within the land, including subsoil natural resources. In the Saramaka case both the State and the\nmembers of the Saramaka people claim a right to these natural resources. The Saramakas claim that their\nright to use and enjoy all such natural resources is a necessary condition for the enjoyment of their right to\nproperty under Article 21\n×\n• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\n34\n\n\fof the Convention. The State argued that all rights to land, particularly its subsoil natural resources, are\nvested in the State, which it can freely dispose of these resources through concessions to third parties.\n258. The IActHR addressed this complex issue in the following order: first, the right of the members of the\nSaramaka people to use and enjoy the natural resources that lie on and within their traditionally owned\nterritory; second, the State's grant of concessions for the exploration and extraction of natural resources,\nincluding subsoil resources found within Saramaka territory; and finally, the fulfilment of international law\nguarantees regarding the exploration extraction concessions already issued by the State.\n259. First, the IActHR analysed whether and to what extent the members of the Saramaka people have a\nright to use and enjoy the natural resources that lie on and within their traditionally owned territory. The\nState did not contest that the Saramakas have traditionally used and occupied certain lands for centuries,\nor that the Saramakas have an \"interest\" in the territory they have traditionally used in accordance with their\ncustoms. The controversy was the nature and scope of the said interest. In accordance with Suriname's\nlegal and constitutional framework, the Saramakas do not have property rights per se, but rather merely a\nprivilege or permission to use and occupy the land in question. According to Article 41 of the Constitution of\nSuriname, and Article 2 of its 1986 Mining Decree, ownership rights of all natural resources are vested in\nthe State. For this reason, the State claimed to have an inalienable right to the exploration and exploitation\nof those resources. On the other hand, the customary laws of the Saramaka people give them a right over\nall natural resources within its traditional territory.\n260. The IActHR held that the cultural and economic survival of indigenous and tribal peoples and their\nmembers depends on their access and use of the natural resources in their territory that are related to their\nculture and are found therein, and that Article 21\n×\n• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the Inter-American Convention protects their right to such natural resources. The Court further said that\nin accordance with their previous jurisprudence as stated in the Yakye Axa and Sawhoyamaxa cases,\nmembers of tribal and indigenous communities have the right to own the natural resources they have\ntraditionally used within their territory for the same reasons that they have a right to own the land they have\ntraditionally used and occupied for centuries. Without them, the very physical and cultural survival of such\npeoples is at stake; 146 hence, the Court opined, the need to protect the lands and resources they have\ntraditionally used to prevent their extinction as a people. It said that the aim and purpose of special\nmeasures required on behalf of members of indigenous and tribal communities is to guarantee that they\nmay continue living their traditional way of life, and that their distinct cultural identity, social structure,\neconomic system, customs, beliefs and traditions are respected, guaranteed and protected by states.\n261. But the Court further said that the natural resources found on and within indigenous and tribal people's\nterritories that are protected under Article 21\n×\n• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\n(of the American Convention) are those natural resources traditionally used and necessary for the very\nsurvival, development and continuation of such people's way of life.147\n262. In the Saramaka case, the Court had to determine which natural resources found on and within the\nSaramaka people's territory are essential for the survival of their way of life, and are thus protected under\nArticle 21\n35\n\n\f×\n• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the Convention. This has direct relevance to the matter in front of the African Commission, given the ruby\nmining concessions which were taking place on lands, both ancestral and adjacent to Endorois ancestral\nland, and which the Complainants allege poisoned the only remaining water source to which the Endorois\nhad access.\n263. The African Commission notes the opinion of the IActHR in the Saramaka case as regards the issue\nof permissible limitations. The State of Suriname had argued that, should the Court recognise a right of the\nmembers of the Saramaka people to the natural resources found within traditionally owned lands, this right\nmust be limited to those resources traditionally used for their subsistence, cultural and religious activities.\nAccording to the State, the alleged land rights of the Saramakas would not include any interests on forests\nor minerals beyond what the tribe traditionally possesses and uses for subsistence (agriculture, hunting,\nfishing etc), and the religious and cultural needs of its people.\n264. The Court opined that while it is true that all exploration and extraction activity in the Saramaka\nterritory could affect, to a greater or lesser degree, the use and enjoyment of some natural resource\ntraditionally used for the subsistence of the Saramakas, it is also true that Article 21\n×\n• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the Convention should not be interpreted in a way that prevents the State from granting any type of\nconcession for the exploration and extraction of natural resources within Saramaka territory. The Court\nobserved that this natural resource is likely to be affected by extraction activities related to other natural\nresources that are not traditionally used by or essential for the survival of the Saramaka community and,\nconsequently, their members. That is, the extraction of one natural resource is most likely to affect the use\nand enjoyment of other natural resources that are necessary for the survival of the Saramakas.\n265. Nevertheless, the Court said that protection of the right to property under Article 21\n×\n• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the Convention is not absolute and therefore does not allow for such a strict interpretation. The Court\nalso recognised the interconnectedness between the right of members of indigenous and tribal peoples to\nthe use and enjoyment of their lands and their right to those resources necessary for their survival but that\nthese property rights, like many other rights recognised in the Convention, are subject to certain limitations\nand restrictions. In this sense, Article 21\n×\n\n36\n\n\f• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the Convention states that the \"law may subordinate [the] use and enjoyment [of property] to the interest\nof society.\" But the Court also said that it had previously held that, in accordance with Article 21\n×\n• Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property. The law may subordinate such use\nand enjoyment to the interest of society.\n• No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just compensation, for reasons of\npublic utility or social interest, and in the cases and according to the forms established by law.\n• Usury and any other form of exploitation of man by man shall be prohibited by law.\nhttp://www.cidh.org/basicos/english/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the Convention, a State may restrict the use and enjoyment of the right to property where the restrictions\nare: a) previously established by law; b) necessary; c) proportional, and d) with the aim of achieving a\nlegitimate objective in a democratic society. 148\n266. The Saramaka case is analogous to the instant case with respect to ruby mining. The IActHR\nanalysed whether gold-mining concessions within traditional Saramaka territory have affected natural\nresources that have been traditionally used and are necessary for the survival of the members of the\nSaramaka community. According to the evidence submitted before the Court, the Saramaka community,\ntraditionally, did not use gold as part of their cultural identity or economic system. Despite possible\nindividual exceptions, the Saramaka community do not identify themselves with gold nor have\ndemonstrated a particular relationship with this natural resource, other than claiming a general right to \"own\neverything, from the very top of the trees to the very deepest place that you could go under the ground.\"\nNevertheless, the Court stated that, because any gold mining activity within Saramaka territory will\nnecessarily affect other natural resources necessary for the survival of the Saramakas, such as waterways,\nthe State has a duty to consult with them, in conformity with their traditions and customs, regarding any\nproposed mining concession within Saramaka territory, as well as allow the members of the community to\nreasonably participate in the benefits derived from any such possible concession, and perform or supervise\nan assessment on the environmental and social impact prior to the commencement of the project. The\nsame analysis would apply regarding concessions in the instant case of the Endorois.\n267. In the instant case of the Endorois, the Respondent State has a duty to evaluate whether a restriction\nof these private property rights is necessary to preserve the survival of the Endorois community. The\nAfrican Commission is aware that the Endoroids do not have an attachment to ruby. Nevertheless, it is\ninstructive to note that the African Commission decided in The Ogoni case that the right to natural\nresources contained within their traditional lands vested in the indigenous people. This decision made clear\nthat a people inhabiting a specific region within a state can claim the protection of Article 21.149 Article 14 of\nthe African Charter indicates that the two-pronged test of 'in the interest of public need or in the general\ninterest of the community' and 'in accordance with appropriate laws' should be satisfied.\n268. As far as the African Commission is aware, that has not been done by the Respondent State. The\nAfrican Commission is of the view the Endorois have the right to freely dispose of their wealth and natural\nresources in consultation with the Respondent State. Article 21(2) also concerns the obligations of a State\nParty to the African Charter in cases of a violation by spoliation, through provision for restitution and\ncompensation. The Endorois have never received adequate compensation or restitution of their land.\nAccordingly, the Respondent State is found to have violated Article 21 of the Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 22\n\n269. The Complainants allege that the Endorois' right to development have been violated as a result of the\nRespondent State's creation of a game reserve and the Respondent State's failure to adequately involve\nthe Endorois in the development process.\n37\n\n\f270. In rebutting the Complainants' allegations, the Respondent State argues that the task of communities\nwithin a participatory democracy is to contribute to the well-being of society at large and not only to care\nselfishly for one's own community at the risk of others. It argues that the Baringo and Koibatek Country\nCouncils are not only representing the Endorois, but other clans of the Tugen tribe, of which the Endorois\nare only a clan. However, to avoid the temptation of one community domineering the other, the Kenyan\npolitical system embraces the principle of a participatory model of community through regular competitive\nelection for representatives in those councils. It states that elections are by adult suffrage and are free and\nfair.\n271. The Respondent State also submits it has instituted an ambitious programme for universal free\nprimary education and an agricultural recovery programme which is aimed at increasing the household\nincomes of the rural poor, including the Endorois; and initiated programmes for the equitable distribution of\nbudgetary resources through the Constituency Development Fund, Constituency Bursary Funds,\nConstituency Aids Committees and District Roads Board.\n272. It adds that for a long time, tourism in Kenya has been on the decline. This, it argues, has been\noccasioned primarily by the ethnic disturbance in the Coast and the Rift Valley provinces which are the\nmajor tourist circuits in Kenya, of which the Complainants land falls and therefore it is expected that the\nCountry Councils of Baringo and Koibatek were affected by the economic down turn.\n273. Further rebutting the allegations of the Complainants, the Respondent State argues that the\nComplainants state in paragraph 239 of their merits brief that due to lack of access to the salts licks and\ntheir usual pasture, their cattle died in large numbers, thereby making them unable to pay their taxes and\nthat, consequently, the government took away more cattle in tax; and that they were also unable to pay for\nprimary and secondary education for their children is utterly erroneous as tax is charged on income.\nAccording to the Respondent State it argues that if the Endorois were not able to raise income which\namounts to the taxable brackets from their animal husbandly, they were obviously not taxed. The\nRespondent State adds that this allegation is false and intended to portray the Government in bad light.\n274. The Respondent State argues that the Complainants allege that the consultations that took place were\nnot in 'good faith' or with the objective of achieving agreement or consent, and furthermore that the\nRespondent State failed to honour the promises made to the Endorois community with respect to revenue\nsharing from the game reserve, having a certain percentage of jobs, relocation to fertile land and\ncompensation. The Respondent State accuses the Complainants of attempting to mislead the African\nCommission because the County Council collects all the revenues in the case of game reserves and such\nrevenues are ploughed back to the communities within the jurisdictions of the County Council through\ndevelopment projects carried out by the County Council.\n275. Responding to the allegation that the game reserve made it particularly difficult for the Endorois to\naccess basic herbal medicine necessary for maintaining a healthy life, the Respondent State argues that\nthe prime purpose of gazetting the national reserve is conservation. Also responding to the claim that the\nRespondent State has granted several mining and logging concessions to third parties, and from which the\nEndorois have not benefited, the Respondent State asserts that the community has been well informed of\nthose prospecting for minerals in the area. It further states that the community's mining committee had\nentered into an agreement with the Kenyan company prospecting for minerals, implying that the Endorois\nare fully involved in all community decisions.\n276. The Respondent State also argues that the community is represented in the Country Council by its\nelected councillors, therefore presenting the community the opportunity to always be represented in the\nforum where decisions are made pertaining to development. The Respondent State argues that all the\ndecisions complained about have had to be decided upon by a full council meeting.\n277. The African Commission is of the view that the right to development is a two-pronged test, that it is\nboth constitutive and instrumental, or useful as both a means and an end. A violation of either the\nprocedural or substantive element constitutes a violation of the right to development. Fulfilling only one of\nthe two prongs will not satisfy the right to development. The African Commission notes the Complainants'\narguments that recognising the right to development requires fulfilling five main criteria: it must be\nequitable, non-discriminatory, participatory, accountable, and transparent, with equity and choice as\nimportant, over-arching themes in the right to development.150\n278. In that regard it takes note of the report of the UN Independent Expert who said that development is\nnot simply the state providing, for example, housing for particular individuals or peoples; development is\ninstead about providing people with the ability to choose where to live. He states \"... the state or any other\nauthority cannot decide arbitrarily where an individual should live just because the supplies of such housing\n38\n\n\fare made available\". Freedom of choice must be present as a part of the right to development.151\n279. The Endorois believe that they had no choice but to leave the Lake and when some of them tried to\nreoccupy their former land and houses they were met with violence and forced relocations. The\nComplainants argue this lack of choice directly contradicts the guarantees of the right to development. The\nAfrican Commission also notes a Report produced for the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations\nrequiring that \"indigenous peoples are not coerced, pressured or intimidated in their choices of\ndevelopment.\"152 Had the Respondent State allowed conditions to facilitate the right to development as in\nthe African Charter, the development of the Game Reserve would have increased the capabilities of the\nEndorois, as they would have had a possibility to benefit from the game reserve. However, the forced\nevictions eliminated any choice as to where they would live.\n280. The African Commission notes the Respondent State's submissions that the community is well\nrepresented in the decision making structure, but this is disputed by the Complainants. In paragraph 27 of\nthe Complainants Merits brief, they allege that the Endorois have no say in the management of their\nancestral land. The EWC, the representative body of the Endorois community, have been refused\nregistration, thus denying the right of the Endorois to fair and legitimate consultation. The Complainants\nfurther allege that the failure to register the EWC has often led to illegitimate consultations taking place,\nwith the authorities selecting particular individuals to lend their consent 'on behalf' of the community.\n281. The African Commission notes that its own standards state that a government must consult with\nrespect to indigenous peoples especially when dealing with sensitive issues as land.153 The African\nCommission agrees with the Complainants that the consultations that the Respondent State did undertake\nwith the community were inadequate and cannot be considered effective participation. The conditions of the\nconsultation failed to fulfil the African Commission's standard of consultations in a form appropriate to the\ncircumstances. It is convinced that community members were informed of the impending project as a fait\naccompli, and not given an opportunity to shape the policies or their role in the game reserve.\n282. Furthermore, the community representatives were in an unequal bargaining position, an accusation\nnot denied or argued by the Respondent State, being both illiterate and having a far different understanding\nof property use and ownership than that of the Kenyan Authorities. The African Commission agrees that it\nwas incumbent upon the Respondent State to conduct the consultation process in such a manner that\nallowed the representatives to be fully informed of the agreement, and participate in developing parts\ncrucial to the life of the community. It also agrees with the Complainants that the inadequacy of the\nconsultation undertaken by the Respondent State is underscored by Endorois' actions after the creation of\nthe game reserve. The Endorois believed, and continued to believe even after their eviction, that the game\nreserve and their pastoralist way of life would not be mutually exclusive and that they would have a right of\nre-entry on to their land. In failing to understand their permanent eviction, many families did not leave the\nlocation until 1986.\n283. The African Commission wishes to draw the attention of the Respondent State that Article 2(3)\n× States have the right and the duty to formulate appropriate national development policies that aim at the\nconstant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals, on the basis of their\nactive, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of the benefits resulting\ntherefrom. http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/rtd.htm accessed 26.10.2010\nof the UN Declaration on Development notes that the right to development includes \"active, free and\nmeaningful participation in development\".154 The result of development should be empowerment of the\nEndorois community. It is not sufficient for the Kenyan authorities merely to give food aid to the Endorois.\nThe capabilities and choices of the Endorois must improve in order for the right to development to be\nrealised.\n284. The case of the Yakye Axa is instructive. The Inter-American Court found that the members of the\nYakye Axa community live in extremely destitute conditions as a consequence of lack of land and access to\nnatural resources, caused by the facts that were the subject matter of proceedings in front of the Court as\nwell as the precariousness of the temporary settlement where they have had to remain, waiting for a\nsolution to their land claim.\n285. The IActHR noted that, according to statements from members of the Yakye Axa community during\nthe public hearing, the members of that community might have been able to obtain part of the means\nnecessary for their subsistence if they had been in possession of their traditional lands. Displacement of the\nmembers of the community from those lands has caused special and grave difficulties to obtain food,\nprimarily because the area where their temporary settlement is located does not have appropriate\nconditions for cultivation or to practice their traditional subsistence activities, such as hunting, fishing, and\n39\n\n\fgathering. Furthermore, in this settlement the members of the Yakye Axa Community do not have access\nto appropriate housing with the basic minimum services, such as clean water and toilets.\n286. The precariousness of the Endorois' post-dispossession settlement has had similar effects. No\ncollective land of equal value was ever accorded (thus failing the test of 'in accordance with the law', as the\nlaw requires adequate compensation). The Endorois were relegated to semi-arid land, which proved\nunsustainable for pastoralism, especially in view of the strict prohibition on access to the Lake area's\nmedicinal salt licks or traditional water sources. Few Endorois got individual titles in the Mochongoi Forest,\nthough the majority live on the arid land on the outskirts of the Reserve.155\n287. In the case of the Yakye Axa community, the Court established that the State did not guarantee the\nright of the members of the Yakye Axa community to communal property. The Court deemed that this had a\nnegative effect on the right of the members of the community to a decent life, because it deprived them of\nthe possibility of access to their traditional means of subsistence, as well as to the use and enjoyment of\nthe natural resources necessary to obtain clean water and to practice traditional medicine to prevent and\ncure illnesses.\n288. In the instant communication in front of the African Commission, video evidence from the\nComplainants shows that access to clean drinking water was severely undermined as a result of loss of\ntheir ancestral land (Lake Bogoria) which has ample fresh water sources. Similarly, their traditional means\nof subsistence - through grazing their animals - has been curtailed due to lack of access to the green\npastures of their traditional land. Elders commonly cite having lost more than half of their cattle since the\ndisplacement.156 The African Commission is of the view that the Respondent State has done very little to\nprovide necessary assistance in these respects.\n289. Closely allied with the right to development is the issue of participation. The IActHR has stated that in\nensuring the effective participation of the Saramaka people in development or investment plans within their\nterritory, the State has a duty to actively consult with the said community according to their customs and\ntraditions. This duty requires the State to both accept and disseminate information, and entails constant\ncommunication between the parties. These consultations must be in good faith, through culturally\nappropriate procedures and with the objective of reaching an agreement.\n290. In the instant communication, even though the Respondent State says that it has consulted with the\nEndorois community, the African Commission is of the view that this consultation was not sufficient. It is\nconvinced that the Respondent State did not obtain the prior, informed consent of all the Endorois before\ndesignating their land as a Game Reserve and commencing their eviction. The Respondent State did not\nimpress upon the Endorois any understanding that they would be denied all rights of return to their land,\nincluding unfettered access to grazing land and the medicinal salt licks for their cattle. The African\nCommission agrees that the Complainants had a legitimate expectation that even after their initial eviction,\nthey would be allowed access to their land for religious ceremonies and medicinal purposes - the reason, in\nfact why they are in front of the African Commission.\n291. Additionally, the African Commission is of the view that any development or investment projects that\nwould have a major impact within the Endorois territory, the State has a duty not only to consult with the\ncommunity, but also to obtain their free, prior, and informed consent, according to their customs and\ntraditions.\n292. From the oral testimony and even the written brief submitted by the Complainants, the African\nCommission is informed that the Endorois representatives who represented the community in discussions\nwith the Respondent State were illiterates, impairing their ability to understand the documents produced by\nthe Respondent State. The Respondent State did not contest that statement. The African Commission\nagrees with the Complainants that the Respondent State did not ensure that the Endorois were accurately\ninformed of the nature and consequences of the process, a minimum requirement set out by the\nInter-American Commission in the Dann case.157\n293. In this sense, it is important to note that the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights\nand Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous People observed that: \"[w]herever [large-scale projects] occur in\nareas occupied by indigenous peoples it is likely that their communities will undergo profound social and\neconomic changes that are frequently not well understood, much less foreseen, by the authorities in charge\nof promoting them. [...] The principal human rights effects of these projects for indigenous peoples relate to\nloss of traditional territories and land, eviction, migration and eventual resettlement, depletion of resources\nnecessary for physical and cultural survival, destruction and pollution of the traditional environment, social\nand community disorganization, long-term negative health and nutritional impacts as well as, in some\ncases, harassment and violence.\" Consequently, the U.N. Special Rapporteur determined that \"[f]ree, prior\n40\n\n\fand informed consent is essential for the [protection of] human rights of indigenous peoples in relation to\nmajor development projects.\"159\n294. In relation to benefit sharing, the IActHR in the Saramaka case said that benefit sharing is vital both in\nrelation to the right to development and by extension the right to own property. The right to development\nwill be violated when the development in question decreases the well-being of the community. The African\nCommission similarly notes that the concept of benefit-sharing also serves as an important indicator of\ncompliance for property rights; failure to duly compensate (even if the other criteria of legitimate aim and\nproportionality are satisfied) result in a violation of the right to property.\n295. The African Commission further notes that in the 1990 'African Charter on Popular Participation in\nDevelopment and Transformation' benefit sharing is key to the development process. In the present context\nof the Endorois, the right to obtain \"just compensation\" in the spirit of the African Charter translates into a\nright of the members of the Endorois community to reasonably share in the benefits made as a result of a\nrestriction or deprivation of their right to the use and enjoyment of their traditional lands and of those natural\nresources necessary for their survival.\n296. In this sense, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has recommended not only\nthat the prior informed consent of communities must be sought when major exploitation activities are\nplanned in indigenous territories but also \"that the equitable sharing of benefits to be derived from such\nexploitation be ensured.\" In the instant case, the Respondent State should ensure mutually acceptable\nbenefit sharing. In this context, pursuant to the spirit of the African Charter benefit sharing may be\nunderstood as a form of reasonable equitable compensation resulting from the exploitation of traditionally\nowned lands and of those natural resources necessary for the survival of the Endorois community.\n297. The African Commission is convinced that the inadequacy of the consultations left the Endorois feeling\ndisenfranchised from a process of utmost importance to their life as a people. Resentment of the unfairness\nwith which they had been treated inspired some members of the community to try to reclaim the Mochongoi\nForest in 1974 and 1984, meet with the President to discuss the matter in 1994 and 1995, and protest the\nactions in peaceful demonstrations. The African Commission agrees that if consultations had been\nconducted in a manner that effectively involved the Endorois, there would have been no ensuing confusion\nas to their rights or resentment that their consent had been wrongfully gained. It is also convinced that they\nhave faced substantive losses - the actual loss in well-being and the denial of benefits accruing from the\ngame reserve. Furthermore, the Endorois have faced a significant loss in choice since their eviction from\nthe land. It agrees that the Endorois, as beneficiaries of the development process, were entitled to an\nequitable distribution of the benefits derived from the game reserve.\n298. The African Commission is of the view that the Respondent State bears the burden for creating\nconditions favourable to a people's development.160 It is certainly not the responsibility of the Endorois\nthemselves to find alternate places to graze their cattle or partake in religious ceremonies. The Respondent\nState, instead, is obligated to ensure that the Endorois are not left out of the development process or\nbenefits. The African Commission agrees that the failure to provide adequate compensation and benefits,\nor provide suitable land for grazing indicates that the Respondent State did not adequately provide for the\nEndorois in the development process. It finds against the Respondent State that the Endorois community\nhas suffered a violation of Article 22 of the Charter.\n\nRecommendations of the African Commission\nIn view of the above, the African Commission finds that the Respondent State is in violation of Articles 1, 8,\n14, 17, 21 and 22 of the African Charter. The African Commission recommends that the Respondent State:\n\n(a) Recognise rights of ownership to the Endorois and Restitute Endorois ancestral land.\n(b) Ensure that the Endorois community has unrestricted access to Lake Bogoria and surrounding sites for\nreligious and cultural rites and for grazing their cattle.\n(c) Pay adequate compensation to the community for all the loss suffered. (d) Pay royalties to the Endorois\nfrom existing economic activities and ensure that they benefit from employment possibilities within the\nreserve.\n41\n\n\f(e) Grant registration to the Endorois Welfare Committee.\n(f) Engage in dialogue with the complainants for the effective implementation of these recommendations.\n(g) Report on the implementation of these recommendations within three months from the date of\nnotification.\n2. The African Commission avails its good offices to assist the parties in the implementation of these\nrecommendations.\nDone in Banjul, The Gambia at the 46th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and\nPeoples' Rights held from 11th - 25th November 2009.\n\n42\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"23","date":"November 25, 2009","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"Freedom of conscience and religion, Regional human rights law, Property rights, Refugee rights, Damages and compensation for victims, Right to housing, Natural resources, Right to education, Economic, social and cultural rights","activity_report":"27th Activity Report: Jun 2009 – Nov 2009","outcome":"15"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080b44c1","title":"Spilg and Mack & DITSHWANELO (on behalf of Lehlohonolo Bernard Kobedi) v.

Botswana\nSummary of Facts\n1. The Communication is submitted by Brain Spilg an advocate in South Africa and Unoda Mack, an\nAttorney with Mack Bahuma & Moncho based in Botswana. The authors of the Communication are\nappointed pro deo 1 representatives for Mr. Lehlohonolo Bernard Kobedi (hereinafter Kobedi), now\ndeceased.\n2. The Complainants allege that on the 14 October 1998, Kobedi was convicted and sentenced to death by\nthe High Court of Botswana for murder of a Sergeant of the Police force of Botswana - Sgt. Kebotsetswe\nGoepamang on 22 May 1993.\n3. According to the Complainants, it is alleged that Sgt. Kebotsetswe Goepamang died as a result of a\nbullet wound, received during the course of a police manhunt on the 22 May 1993 from Kobedi who had\nescaped from custody. The Complainants however maintained that the shot had been fired by another\npoliceman and not by Kobedi. They claim that he had been wrongly charged with the murder of Sgt.\nKebotsetswe Goepamang.\n4. The Complainants submit that Sgt. Goepamang had been shot by a high velocity firearm, AK 47, a type\nused by the police force and not a low velocity firearm such as found in possession of the accused/victim\nwhich was a Kalashnikov 9mm. It is further submitted by the Complainants that were it not for gross\nmedical mismanagement by the hospitals and medical staff treating sergeant Goepamang, he would not\nhave died from injuries. The Complainants state that during the trial, crucial ballistic analysis and expert\nmedical evidence was adduced which revealed a contradiction in the initial ballistic analysis relied upon by\nthe Court to convict Kobedi. They claim that there was gross medical negligence towards Sgt.Goepamang\nduring his time in hospital.\n5. However, the Complainants allege that the Court refused to receive or test the said objective, material\nand compelling evidence thereby violating Articles 4, 5 and 7 of the African Charter on Human and\nPeoples' Rights (hereinafter the African Charter). They claimed that this evidence was critical to proving the\ninnocence of Kobedi and to addressing the question whether the death sentence was the most appropriate\npunishment.\n6. The Complainants also submit that the compulsory requirement under Botswana legislation for Court to\nimpose a death sentence for murder where no extenuating circumstances are shown violates Articles 2, 3,\n4, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.\n7. Furthermore, the Complainants submit that Kobedi was living under fear of the imposition of the death\nsentence for over a decade since he was first arrested and was on death row since September 1998. The\ncomplainants allege that the long delay in trying Kobedi also exposed him to unnecessary cruel, inhuman\nand degrading treatment for the reason that he had lived for an unconscionable amount of time awaiting the\nimposition of a death sentence.\n8. It is also allege by the Complainants that Kobedi was likely to suffer unnecessary inhuman treatment and\npunishment not only because the execution will be carried out by the cruel method of death by hanging, but\nalso because he was aware that his medical ailment would have caused him greater and more prolonged\nagony during the execution than if he were medically fit.\n9. Kobedi was executed before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (hereinafter the\nAfrican Commission or the Commission) could initiate an appeal for Provisional Measures.\n10. From the foregoing, the Complainants request the African Commission to:\n• Hold that there has been a violation of Articles 2, 3, 5 and 7 of the African Charter by the\nRespondent State.\n• Urge the Respondent State not to impose the death sentence on the victim and not to carry out the\ndeath sentence by the method of hanging.\n• Adopt such further or other recommendations and procedures as to protect the victim's rights under\nthe African Charter.\n\n1\n\n\fComplaint\n11. The Complainants alleges a violation of Articles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.\n\nProcedure\n12. The Communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 18 July 2003.\n13. On 21 July 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the Complainants acknowledging\nreceipt of the Communication and requesting information as to the veracity of the information received at\nthe Secretariat of the African Commission that Kobedi had been executed on the 18 July 2003. There was\nno response from the Complainants in this regard.\n14. At its 34th Ordinary Session held from 6 to 20 November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission decided to be seized of the matter.\n15. On 7 November 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a letter from the\nComplainants in response to its letter of 21 July 2003 which tried to confirm the execution of Kobedi.\n16. On 14 November 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a letter from the\nComplainants indicating that DITSHWANELO, a human right NGO based in Botswana was an interested\nparty in this Communication and is therefore authorized to access any information relating to the\nCommunication.\n17. On 4 December 2003, the parties to the Communication were informed accordingly and requested to\nforward their written submissions on Admissibility of the Communication within 3 months.\n18. By Email dated 4 March 2004, the Complainants forwarded a copy of their submissions on Admissibility\nof the Communication. Annexes to the submissions were transmitted by fax on the same day.\n19. On 8 March 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the Complainants\nsubmissions and forwarded a copy of the said submissions to the Responsible State by DHL courier\nservice.\n20. By Note Verbale dated 25 May 2004, the Secretariat received a preliminary response from the\nRespondent State on the Admissibility of the Communication. It also requested the African Commission to\ndefer consideration of the Communication to the next Session in order to enable it to submit supplementary\narguments after obtaining the original Complaint submitted by the Complainants.\n21. At its 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 21 May to 4 June 2004, the African\nCommission considered the request for deferment from the Respondent State and decided to defer\nconsideration of the Communication on the Admissibility to the 36th Ordinary Session so as to allow the\nRespondent State to forward exhaustive written submissions on Admissibility.\n22. By Note Verbale dated 15 June 2004, the Respondent State was notified of the African Commission's\ndecision and a copy of the Communication as well as the Complainants' submissions on Admissibility were\nalso transmitted to the Respondent State.\n23. By letter dated 15 June 2004, the Complainants were also notified of the decision of the African\nCommission.\n24. By Note Verbale of 16 September 2004 the Secretariat of the African Commission reminded the\nRespondent State to submit all its arguments on Admissibility.\n25. At the 36th Ordinary Session held in Dakar, Senegal from 23 November to 7 December 2004, the\nAfrican Commission heard oral submissions from the Respondent State only and deferred its decision on\nthe matter pending a response from the Complainants on the observations made by the Respondent State\nregarding the issue of the Complainants' locus standi.\n26. By Note Verbale dated 13 December 2004, the Respondent state was notified of the decision of the\nAfrican Commission. By letter of same date the Secretariat of the African Commission by DHL courier\nservice forwarded the preliminary submission of the State on the question of locus standi and its decision to\ndefer consideration on Admissibility pending the Complainants' response on the Respondent State's\nsubmissions on locus standi.\n27. On the 12 January 2005, the Complainants acknowledged receipt of the Secretariat's letter of 13\nDecember 2004 and indicated that a proper response would be sent in due course.\n28. By the letter dated 28 February 2005, the Secretariat reminded the Complainants to submit their\nobservations on the question of locus standi before 13 March 2005 and informed them that the African\n2\n\n\fCommission would consider the Admissibility of the Communication at its 37th Ordinary Session.\n29. On 29 April 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission received the Complainants' response to\nthe Respondent State's observation on locus standi.\n30. At its 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul from 27 April to 11 May 2005, the African Commission\ndeferred consideration of the Communication pending the finalization of a study on the question of locus\nstandi and legal interest within the context of its Communication Procedure.\n31. By Note Verbale dated 10 June 2005, the Respondent State was notified of the decision of the African\nCommission and by the letter of the same date the Complainants were also notified of the African\nCommission's decision.\n32. During the 38th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication in light of the\nobjections raised by the Respondent State regarding the issue of locus standi of the Complainants and\ndecided to declare the Communication Admissible.\n33. By Note Verbale and letter dated 15 December 2006, the Respondent State and the Complainants\nwere notified of the African Commission's decision.\n34. At its 39th Ordinary Session held in May 2006, the African Commission considered the Communication,\nand decided to defer further consideration thereon to its 40th Ordinary Session.\n35. At its 40th Ordinary Session, the African Commission further considered the Communication and\ndeferred further consideration to its 41st Ordinary Session.\n36. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 9 February 2007, the parties were reminded of the African\nCommission's decision on Admissibility and were requested to submit their arguments on the Merits by 8\nApril 2007, for the African Commission's consideration at its 41st Ordinary Session.\n37. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 27 April 2007, the African Commission reminded the parties of its\nrequest for their arguments on the Merits and requested them to make their submissions latest by 10 May\n2007.\n38. At its 41st Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and deferred\nfurther consideration to its 42nd Ordinary Session to allow both parties submit on the Merits.\n39. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 10 July 2007, both parties were notified of the African Commission's\ndecision.\n40. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 11 September 2007, the African Commission reminded both parties\nto submit their arguments on the Merits.\n41. By Email of 3 October 2007, the Secretariat received the submissions on the Merits from the\nComplainants.\n42. By Note Verbale dated 17 October 2007, the African Commission forwarded the Complainants'\nsubmissions to the Respondent State and by a letter of the same date acknowledged receipt of the\nComplainant's submission on the Merits.\n43. By Note Verbale of 22 October 2007, the Respondent State acknowledged receipt of the Complainants'\nsubmissions on the Merits, but informed the African Commission that the submissions were received after\nthe deadline had passed and requested that the Communication be deferred to the 43rd Ordinary Session\nto give it time to submit its own arguments on the Merits.\n44. By Note Verbale of 29 October 2007, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt\nof the Respondent State's Note Verbale and informed the Respondent State that a decision on its request\nwill be made by the African Commission during its 42nd Ordinary Session.\n45. At its 42nd Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and deferred its\ndecision to the 43rd Ordinary Session to allow the Respondent State to submit its arguments on the Merits.\n46. On 13 May 2008, the Secretariat of the African Commission received the Respondent State's\nsubmissions on the Merits.\n47. At its 43rd Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and decided to\ndefer further considerations to the 44th Ordinary Session to allow the Complainants to be served with the\nRespondent State's submissions on the Merits.\n48. By a letter dated 17 June 2008, the Complainants were notified and served with a copy of the\nRespondent State's submission on the Merits.\n49. At its 44th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and decided to\ndefer further consideration of same to its 45th Ordinary Session to allow the Complainants to respond to the\nRespondent State's submissions on the Merits.\n50. By Note Verbale and a letter dated the 5 January 2009, both parties were informed of this decision and\nthe Complainants were requested to send their response before 5 March 2009.\n3\n\n\f51. At its 45th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and deferred\nfurther consideration, thereon, to its 46th Ordinary Session to allow the African Commission to prepare a\ndecision on the Merits.\n52. At its 46th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and again\ndeferred its decision on the Merits to its 47th Ordinary Session.\n53. By Note Verbale and a letter dated 14 December 2009, the Secretariat of the African Commission\nnotified both parties of its decision.\n54. At its 47th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and decided to\ndefer its decision on the Merits to its 48th Ordinary Session.\n55. At its 48th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and decided to\ndefer its decision on the Merits to its 49th Ordinary Session.\n56. At its 49th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and decided to\ndefer decision on the merit to the 50th Ordinary Session, and by a note verbale and a letter dated 16 August\n2011, both the Complainant and the Respondents were informed of the Commission's decision.\n57. At its 50th Ordinary Session, the African commission considered the decision on the merits and made\ncomments. The Commission requested the Secretariat to incorporate its comments on the Communication\nand present it to the 10th Extra- ordinary Session for revision and adoption.\n58. At its 10th Extra-ordinary Session held from 12 to 16 December 2011, in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nAfrican Commission considered and adopted the Communication on Merit.\nSubmissions on Locus Standi\nRespondent State's Submissions on Locus Standi\n\n59. The African Commission was seized of this Communication at its 34th Ordinary Session held in Banjul,\nThe Gambia from 6 to 20 November 2003.\n60. In its preliminary submissions, the Respondents State argues that the Communication should be\ndeclared inadmissible on the ground that the authors lacked locus standii to submit or assume authorship\nof the Communication. The Respondent State argues that both Unoda Mack, a national of Botswana, and\nBrain Spilg SC, a national of South Africa were briefed as pro deo to argue the appeal of Kobedi before the\nBotswana Court of Appeal at the instance of the Registrar of the High Court of Botswana. The Respondent\nState argues that though Kobedi accepted to have them as his legal representatives, they were not, as it\nwere, the personal choice of Mr. Kobedi.\n61. The Respondent State submits that the Communication dated 11 July 2003 and addressed to the\nAfrican Commission was signed by Kobedi. However, it argues that paragraph 15 of the Complainants\nwritten submissions on Admissibility sent by Email on 4 March 2004 lists the two lawyers as the authors of\nthe Communication. The Respondents State assert that the said written submissions, do not, indicate to the\nAfrican Commission the legal interest that Messrs Brain Spilg SC and Unoda Mack, jointly and severally,\nhave in the Communication such that they should assume authorship of it, and the basis and source of that\nlegal interest. The Respondent State argues that, instead, what Brain Spilg SC and Unoda Mack attempt to\ndo in paragraph 3-14 of the submissions on Admissibility is to make a case for the African Commission to\nhear a matter originated by the deceased.\n62. The Respondent State adds that Brain Spilg SC is a national of a foreign country, and as such, the only\nconnection he has with Botswana is in relation to the privilege accorded him by Botswana to appear before\nher Courts. The Respondent State therefore questions whether Brain Spilg SC has any legitimate legal\ninterest in the affairs of the country?\n63. The Respondent State further argues that neither the laws of Botswana nor international laws\nincorporate the actio popularis doctrine. Consequently, Messrs Brain Spilg SC and Unoda Mack must\ndemonstrate a sufficient legal interest in the Communication for them to possess locus standi to author it.\nThe Respondent State contends that in adhering to the African Charter, it did not understand that it was\ngiving strangers the carte blanche to occupy Botswana and utilize its resources in dealing with\nCommunications of this nature.\n64. Accordingly, the Respondent State submits that although the Communication was originally and\nproperly before the African Commission, it does not have an author to pursue it, as Brain Spilg SC and\nUnoda Mack do not have the competency to pursue the matter on behalf of Kobedi who is now deceased.\n\n4\n\n\fComplainants' Submissions on Locus Standi\n\n65. In response to the Respondent State's submissions, the Complainants confirmed they were appointed\nby the Registrar of the High Court of Botswana to represent Kobedi during the proceedings before the\nBotswana Courts. They argue that Brain Spilg SC has practiced Law in Botswana since 1982, and in spite\nof the changes in the law affecting practice by non-resident practitioners, Brain Spilg SC had continued to\nreceive instructions from the Government of Botswana and its parastatal bodies, ordinary corporations and\nindividuals. The Complainants said the facts that advocate Brain Spilg SC is not a citizen of Botswana is\nirrelevant to the authorship of this Communication because it is not a requirement under the African\nCommission's Communication procedure. Indeed the Complainants states that the Victim (Kobedi), as well\nas other accused persons whose capital cases have not been finally disposed of, are non-citizens of\nBotswana.\n66. On the question of lack of interest, the Complainants aver that the information on the Communication\nProcedures prepared by the Secretariat of the African Commission does not require the author to indicate\ntheir legal interest when submitting a Communication. They argue that by requiring Complainants to\nindicate their legal interest, the Respondent State challenges the very purpose and function for which the\nAfrican Commission was established.\n67. Additionally, the Complainants argue that Article 56 of the African Charter which governs the\nAdmissibility of a Communication lists only seven Admissibility requirements, and that ,,legal interest\" or\n,,citizenship of the Complainant\" are not included in that list. They argue further that Article 56 provides a\nminimum threshold requirement, which is intended to encourage, rather than stifle the submission of\nallegations of human rights violations before the African Commission. Furthermore, stated that Article 56\nassist the African Commission to ensure that vexatious Communications are sifted out, and allow\nissue-driven Communications to be entertained by it,.\n68. Regarding the Respondent State's argument that actio popularis is not part of their domestic law, the\nComplainants submit that this assertion is irrelevant because the Respondent State did not sign a domestic\ndocument, but sign an international human rights document, which by its very nature is intended to have\nremedial consequences. This requires signatory States to submit themselves to scrutiny by the African\nCommission in respect of the alleged violations of human and peoples' rights.\n69. In conclusion, the Complainants assert that by requiring the Complainants to demonstrate direct legal\ninterest in a Communication would be restrictive and ,,impermissibly narrow which will fail to have regard to\nthe accepted constitutional norms and the express provisions of the African Charter\". Furthermore, the\nComplainants submit that such an approach would also fail to take into account the function and purpose of\nthe African Commission. Consequently, it is the Complainants' prayers that a generous and purposive\nconstruction be given to Article 56 in order to give effect to the spirit of the African Charter.\n70. The thrust of the Respondent State's submissions is that though originally properly before the African\nCommission, the Communication is now without an author to pursue it as a result of Kobedi's execution.\nAccordingly, the Communication should be declared Inadmissible because the present authors pursuing\nthe matter are without a mandate cum locus standi.\n71. The objection raised by the Respondent State raises the issue of whether or not the Complainants in\nthis Communication have locus standi before the African Commission, that is, whether Messrs Brain Spilg\nSC and Unoda Mack have any legal interest in the matter so as to assume authorship of it on Kobedi's\nbehalf. This issue also interrogates the principle of actio popularis within the context of the African Charter.\nAfrican Commission's Ruling on the Preliminary Determination on Locus Standi\n\n72. Having looked at the Admissibility requirement under Article 56 and bearing in mind the objections\nraised by the Respondent State on the locus standi of the Complainants, the African Commission decides\nas follows:\n73. The African Commission notes that neither the African Charter nor its Rules of Procedure makes\nprovisions on the locus standii of parties before it. In fact, the only Charter provision that could bear any\nrelevance to the issue of locus standi is Article 56(1) of the African Charter. This provision relates to\nauthors of a Communication submitted before the African Commission and provides: \"Communications\nrelating to Human and Peoples' Rights referred to in Article 55 received by the Commission shall be\nconsidered if they: (1) indicate their authors even if the later request anonymity; .... \"\n74. It is very clear that Article 56(1) simply requires that the Communication indicate its author(s), even if\nthey would like to remain anonymous. This provision does not specify which parties have standings before\n5\n\n\fthe African Commission. Indeed nowhere is it stated within the African Charter or African Commission's\nRules that there should be a link between the author of a Communication and the victim of a human rights\nviolation.\n75. In fact, the African Commission has interpreted the relevant Article 56(1) of the African Charter, and\nalso addressed the question of locus standi before it in the Consolidated case of Communication 54/91,\n61/91, 98/93, 164/97, to 196/97, 210/98. 2 In this case, the African Commission held that: \"Article 56(1) of\nthe Charter demands that anyone submitting Communications to the Commission relating to human and\npeoples' rights must reveal their identity. They do not necessarily have to be victims of such violations or\nmembers of their families. This characteristic of the African Charter reflects ,,sensitivity to the practical\ndifficulties that individuals can face in countries where human rights are violated. The national or\ninternationals channels of remedy may not be accessible to the victims themselves or may be dangerous to\npursue.\" 3 There is therefore no requirement of legal interest for the authorship of a Communication. 4\n76. Consequently, the African Commission has, through its practice and jurisprudence, adopted a generous\naccess to its Complaint Procedure. It has adopted the actio popularis principle, allowing everyone the legal\ninterest and capacity to file a Communication, for its consideration. For this purpose, non- victim individuals,\ngroups and NGOs constantly submit Communications to the African Commission. More so, the African\nCommission, has, through its Guidelines on the Submission of Communications5 , encouraged the\nsubmission of Communications on behalf of victims of human rights violations, especially those who are\nunable to represent themselves.\n77. In Communication 155/966 , for example, the African Commission endorsed the actio popularis\ndoctrine when it \"thank(ed) the two human rights NGOs who brought the matter under its purview: the\nSocial and Economic Rights Action Center (Nigeria) and the Center for Economic and Social Rights (USA).\nSuch is the demonstration of the usefulness to the African Commission and individuals of actio popularis,\nwhich is wisely allowed under the African Charter.\" The actio popularis doctrine allows persons interested in\nthe protection of human rights in Africa to seize the African Commission on behalf of persons who for one\nreason or the other, cannot do so on their own.\n78. The rationale for this broad approach to locus standi is in view of the fact that the African Commission,\nmandated to promote and protect human and peoples' rights in Africa7 , bears in mind the fact that in some\ninstances, individuals in Africa whose rights are violated, may be faced with practical difficulties that may\npreclude them from pursuing national or international legal remedies on their own behalf. The African\nCommission has therefore adopted the practice of entertaining Communications from persons who are\ninterested in protecting human rights on the continent. These may be the victims themselves or civil society\norganizations acting on behalf of victims of the alleged violations.8 This actio popularis principle has been\nconfirmed in various subsequent decisions of the Africa Commission.9\n79. Also in relation to the requirement of citizenship, the African Commission has made it clear through its\njurisprudence that the person or NGO filing the Communication need not be a national or be registered in\nthe territory of the Respondent State. An endless list of examples of this would include the many cases\nsubmitted to the African Commission by individuals and NGOs of non- African origin.10\n80. The African Commission, therefore, notes that the foregoing was its approach to locus standi when it\nbecame seized of the present Communication, and is still its current approach to the issue. Accordingly, the\nAfrican Commission would address this Communication in light of its broad approach to locus standi at the\ntime it became seized of this Communication.\n81. The African Commission further disagrees with the Respondent State's assertion that neither the laws\nof Botswana nor international law incorporates the actio popularis doctrine, and notes that this is a common\npractice within regional and international human rights systems which is aimed at conferring legal standing\nto certain groups who will not be required to have a sufficient interest in a case or to maintain the\nimpairment of a right. To this effect, different bodies had setup different criteria with regards to accessibility\nto their complaint mechanisms. The African Commission notes that, the European human rights system11\nand the UN Human Rights Committee,12 generally requires that the person submitting a case to be a victim\nof the violation. But there are exceptions to this rule, where non-victims may bring a complaint on behalf of\nthe victim(s).13 On the other hand, the American Convention of Human Rights permits any person or group\nof persons, or any non-governmental entity legally recognized in one or more Member States of the\nOrganization to submit a matter before the Inter-American Commission.14 The practice of the African\nCommission though somewhat similar to the actio popularis position under the Inter-American system, is\neven wider as it places no restriction as to who can bring a Communication before it. As long as the\n6\n\n\fconditions under Article 56 of the African Charter are met by the person standing before it, the African\nCommission will enter the Communication. The rationale for the Commission's comparative broader\napproach to the issue of locus standi has been associated with the peculiarity of the African situation, and\nthe perceived generous intent of the African Charter.15\n82. From the foregoing, the African Commission will entertain the Communication brought by Messrs Brain\nSpilg SC and Unoda Mack, being non- victims, with no legal interest, because its jurisprudence makes it\nclear that there is no requirement of ,,legal interest\" for authorship of a Communication.16\n83. The African Commission holds the fact that Mr. Brain Spilg SC is not a Citizen of Botswana as argued\nby the Respondents will have bearing on this Communication. It is simply not a requirement for authorship\nof a Communication. Any interested individual can bring a Communication on behalf of a victim and such\nindividuals need not be citizens of States Parties to the African Charter. The fact that Mr. Brain Spilg SC is\na national of another country is immaterial. As long as he satisfies the conditions set out in Article 56 of the\nAfrican Charter, the African Commission will entertain the Communication as it has done, in several other\ncases where Communications have been instituted by non-nationals of States against whom the\nCommunication is being instituted.17\n84. The African Commission is therefore unable to agree with the Respondent State's argument which\nseems to infer that citizenship of the authors of the Communication is a criterion within the provision of\nArticle 56(1) of the African Charter. This would not only be tantamount to reading new criteria into the\nprovision, but would also restrict the open-ended spirit found therein. Consequently, the Respondents\nState's argument that the Communication is now without an author to pursue it as a result of Kobedi's\nexecution is also unsustainable as the present Communication is properly before the African Commission\nin terms of Article 56(1) of the African Charter.\n85. The African Commission hereby concludes that the Complainants in this matter possess locus standi\nbefore it, and will however proceed to examine the Communication in view of the other Admissibility\nrequirements.\nThe Law on Admissibility\nComplainants' Submissions on Admissibility\n\n86. The Complainants submit that they have fulfilled all the requirements of Article 56 of the African\nCharter.\n87. The Complainants submit that the Communication is jointly presented by Advocate Brain Spilg SC\nassisted by Attorney Unoda Mack and Ms Alica Mogwe (on behalf of Ditshwanelo). By detailing their\ncontact email addresses as spilg@law.co.za for Brain Spilg SC and legal.ditshwanelo@info.bw for\nDitshwanelo, the Complainants argue that they complied with Article 56(1) of the African Charter.\n88. With regards to Article 56(2) of the African Charter, the Complainants contend that not only have they\noutlined the Charter provisions which are allegedly violated by the Respondent State to include Articles 1,\n2, 3, {{4,4}, 5 and 7 of the African Charter, but that they have also made submissions in support of the\nalleged violations. The Complainants submit that the Communication, therefore, satisfies the requirements\nof Article 56(2) of the African Charter.\n89. With regards to the requirement of decorum, the Complainants submit that the tone of language used in\nthe Communication meets the requirement of Article 56(3) of the African Charter.\n90. Concerning the requirement of evidential weight envisaged under Article 56(4) of the African Charter,\nthe Complainants aver that the Communication is based on primary evidence that has been either verified\nunder oath or is within the personal knowledge of the authors. While conceding that there is a single\nreference to a media article, the Complainants argued that not only is that information tangential, but also\nthat the source of the article is verified under oath by the newspaper's editors and forms part of the records\nof the Botswana Court of Appeal. The Complainants submit that the provisions of Article 56(4) have been\nadequately met.\n91. On the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56(5) of the African Charter, the\nComplainants aver that they have exhausted all available local remedies with respect to Kobedi's case. In\nparticular, aver the Complainants, the highest Court in Botswana, the Court of Appeal, has determined the\ncase. They therefore submit that the Communication satisfies the requirements of Article 56(5) of the\nAfrican Charter.\n92. With regards to the reasonable time factor under Article 56(6) of the African Charter, the Complainants\n7\n\n\fargue that the Communication was submitted within a period of four months since the Kobedi's stay of\nexecution appeal was disposed of by the Botswana Court of Appeal. The Communication, argues the\nComplainants, also meets the requirements of Article 56(6) of the African Charter.\n93. With regards to Article 56(7) of the African Charter, the Complainants submit that the instant case has\nnot previously been determined by the African Commission and there are no other international avenues\nthat are being explored by the Complainants as far as this matter is concerned. The Communication,\ncontends the Complainants, satisfies the provision of Article 56(7) of the African Charter.\nRespondent State's Submissions on Admissibility\n\n94. In its written submission dated 25 May 2004 the Respondent State asserted that it did not concede the\nother grounds upon which the Complainants rely for the Admissibility of the Communication.\n95. However, in its oral submission made at the African Commission's 36th Ordinary Session held from 23\nNovember to 7 December 2004 in Dakar, Senegal, the Respondent State opted not to furnish further\nsubmissions apart from those on locus standi. The Respondent State stated that in the event that the\nAfrican Commission rules in favor of the Complainants on the issue of locus standi, they would not contest\nthe Admissibility of the Communication.\nCommission's Decision on Admissibility\n\nThe Admissibility of the Communications submitted before the African Commission is governed by the\nseven conditions set out in Article 56 of the African Charter.\n96. The current Communication is submitted pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter which allows the\nAfrican Commission to receive and consider Communications, other than from States Parties. Article 56 of\nthe African Charter provides that the admissibility of a Communication submitted pursuant to Article 55 is\nsubject to seven conditions.18 The African Commission has stressed that the conditions laid down in Article\n56 are conjunctive, meaning that if any one of them is not satisfied, the Communication will be declared\ninadmissible.\n97. Article 56(1) of the African Charter requires that a Communication received under Article 55 of the\nAfrican Charter shall be considered if it \"indicates their authors even if the latter requests anonymity\".\nArticle 56(1) of the African Charter will, therefore, be satisfied if the Communication discloses the identity\nand details of the authors thereof.19 The purport and intent of Article 56(1) of the African Charter is to\nensure that the African Commission is in communication with the author. It is only through this medium of\ncommunication that the African Commission will be assured of the author's continued interest in the case,\nor to request, as provided for under Rule 104 of the Rules of procedure, supplementary information if the\ncase so requires.20\n98. In the instant Communication, the Complainants have disclosed that it is jointly presented by Advocate\nBrain Spilg SC assisted by Attorney Unoda Mack and Ms Alica Mogwe (on behalf of Ditshwanelo). The\nCommunication also discloses the contact Email addresses of the Complainants as spilg@law.co.za for\nBrain Spilg SC and legal.ditshwanelo@info.bw for Ditshwanelo. The African Commission is, therefore,\nholds that the Complainants have complied with Article 56(1) of the African Charter.\n99. Article 56(2) of the African Charter requires that the Communication must be compatible with the\nConstitutive Act of the African Union and with the African Charter. With respect to the Constitutive Act, the\nAfrican Commission will not receive any Communication brought before it, which seeks a prayer a remedy\nof which will contravene any provision of the said Constitutive Act. Thus, in Katangese's Peoples'\nCongress V. Zaire,21 a redress which infringed on the doctrine of Uti Possidetis Juris22 enshrined in Article\n3 of the OAU Charter and now in Article 4 (b) of the Constitutive Act, was rejected and the case declared\nInadmissible.\n100. In Kevin Mgwanga Ngumne et al V. Cameroon,23 the African Commission, drawing inspiration from\nits previous decisions affirmed that, the condition relating to compatibility with the Charter, basically\nrequires that: (a) the Communication should be brought against a State party to the African Charter;24 (b)\nthe Communication must allege prima facie violations of rights protected by the African Charter;25 (c) the\nCommunication should be brought in respect of violations that occurred after ratification of the African\nCharter or where violations that began before the State Party ratified the African Charter have continued\neven after such ratification.26 To be in conformity with the African Charter also requires the petition to\n8\n\n\fcontain a certain degree of specificity, and that the allegations are not vague.27\n101. A careful consideration of the facts and submissions from both parties to the present Communication\ndo not show that the instant Communication is at variance with any part of the Constitutive Act of the\nAfrican Union or the African Charter. The Commission is therefore of the view that the present\nCommunication satisfies the provision of Article 56 (2) of the Charter.\n102. Article 56(3) of the African Charter requires that the Communication should be presented with a\ncertain degree of decorum. This Article prohibits the use of disparaging and/or insulting language in\npresenting a Communication. Although Article 56(3) does not define what constitutes disparaging or\ninsulting language, the African Commission in the case of IIesanmi v. Nigeria28 the Commission held inter\nalia, that, to be insulting, the language must be aimed at undermining the integrity and status of the\ninstitution (Respondent State) and bring it into disrepute.29 In this case, the African Commission held the\nComplainant's averments that, \"the police and customs officials are corrupt, that they deal with drug\nsmugglers, that they extort money from motorists and that the President himself was corrupt and had been\nbribed by the drug smugglers\" as an insulting language. In Ligue Camerounaise des Droits de l'Homme\nv. Cameroon,30 the African Commission also held that averments such as \"Paul Biya must respond to\ncrimes against humanity\", \"30 years of the criminal neo-colonial regime incarnated by the duo Ahidjo/Biya\",\n\"regime of torturers\", and \"government barbarisms\"31 as insulting language.\n103. However, in Bakweri Land Claims Committee v. Cameroon32 the African Commission held that the\nuse of strong language such as \"no judge... will risk his/her career, not to mention his/her life, to handle this\npolitically sensitive matter...\" per se will not amount to disparaging and insulting language.33\n104. After a careful examination of the tone of the language used in presenting the Communication, the\nAfrican Commission is satisfied that the Complainants have met the requirements under Article 56(3) of the\nAfrican Charter.\n105. Article 56(4) of the African Charter requires that any Communication brought pursuant to Article 55 of\nthe African Charter will be considered if the facts are not based exclusively on information from the mass\nmedia. This requires that the Complainants must proof that, the evidence of the facts constituting the\nalleged violations, are not based exclusively on information from the mass media. While conceding that\nthere is a single reference to news obtained from the mass media, the Complainants have argued that this\nCommunication is based on primary evidence within the knowledge of the Complainants.\n106. In the case of Sir Dawda K Jawara v. Gambia34 the African Commission held that while it will be\ndangerous to rely exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media, it would be equally damaging\nif the African Commission were to reject a Communication because some aspects of it are based on news\ndisseminated through the mass media. For this reason, the African Commission believes that the present\nCommunication meets Complainants the requirements of Article 56(4) of the African Charter.\n107. Article 56(5) of the African Charter on its part requires that Communications brought under Article 55\nof the African Charter shall be considered only if they \"are sent after the exhaustion of local remedies, if\nany, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged\". The relevance of Article 56 (5) of the\nAfrican Charter is to ensure that international mechanisms are not substitutes for domestic implementation\nof human rights, but should be seen as tools to assist the domestic authorities to develop a sufficient\nprotection of human rights in their territories.\n108. The African Commission notes that the submissions of the Complainants that Kobedi's case has been\ndealt with by the Botswana Court of Appeal, the apex court in the Respondent State, are relevant to the\nissue of exhaustion of local remedies. The African Commission is, therefore, satisfied that the\nCommunication has not contravened the provision of Article 56(5) of the African Charter.\n109. According to Article 56(6) of the African Charter, Article 55 Communications will be considered if\nsubmitted to the African Commission within a reasonable time after the exhaustion of local remedies. While\nthe African Charter is silent as to what amounts to a reasonable time, it is important to note here that, the\nissue of reasonable time is determined on a case to case bases taking into consideration all the relevant\nfacts. The present Communication was submitted within four months following the decision of the Botswana\nCourt of Appeal. The period of four months in the circumstances of this case is reasonable. The African\nCommission, therefore, holds that the Complainants have satisfied Article 56(6) of the African Charter.\n110. By virtue of Article 56(7) of the African Charter, Article 55 Communication will be considered if the\nCommunication does not deal with cases that have already been settled by African Commission or another\ninternational settlement body. The requirement under Article 56(7) of the African Charter is founded on the\nnon bis in idem rule35 which ensures that no State may be sued or condemned more than once for the\nsame alleged human rights violations. The rule also seeks to uphold and recognize the res judicata36 status\n9\n\n\fof decisions issued by international and regional tribunals and/or bodies such as the African Commission.\nAccordingly, the African Commission will not entertain any Communication with the same facts and\nparties37 as that, which has been settled by another international body.\n111. In Bob Ngozi Njoku v. Egypt38 the African Commission noted that Article 56(7) of the African Charter\n\"...talks about cases which have been settled...\"39 and not cases which are still pending before other\ninternational mechanisms.\n112. The African Commission is satisfied that the Complainants, in their written submissions, have\nexhaustively addressed the seven Admissibility requirements under Article 56 of the African Charter and\nhereby declares the Communication Admissible under Article 56 of the African Charter.\nSubmissions on the merits\nComplainants' Submissions on the Merits\n\n113. The Complainants submit that the compulsory requirement under Botswana law for the Courts to\nimpose the death penalty for murder, where no extenuating circumstances are shown; the adoption of the\ndoctrine of \"functus officio\" by the Court of Appeal of the Respondent State with regards to the trial of\nKobedi; the clemency petition process and the use of hanging as a method of execution of Kobedi violates\nArticles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Articles 2 and 3 (Right not to be Discriminated and Right to Equality before the\nlaw)\n114. The Complainants argue that the compulsory requirement under Botswana legislation that a Court\nmust impose the death penalty for murder, absent only extenuating circumstance limits the factors that can\nbe taken into consideration in respect of sentencing. They submit that the exclusion of considerations such\nas rehabilitation or such other factors personal to the victim violates Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter.\nThey submit that the distinction between taking into account extenuating circumstances and not taking into\naccount mitigating factors is both arbitrary and discriminative.\nAlleged Violation of Article 4 (Right to Life)\n115. The Complainants argue that because the imposition of the death penalty is qualitatively different from\nany other sentence or sanction that may be imposed by a Court of Law, there is a corresponding difference\nin the need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.\nThe Complainants rely on the decision of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Downer &\nTracey v. Jamaica to argue the fact that the death penalty is an exceptional form of punishment which\nmust also be considered in interpreting Article 4 of the African Charter.\n116. The Complainants refer the African Commission to the of case of Maauwe & Motswetla concluded in\n2006 by the Court of Appeal of the Respondent State to buttress the point that the criminal justice system in\nthe Respondent State is not infallible. They argue that, because the criminal justice system is capable of\nbeing fallible, the Courts should not ignore subsequent cogent evidence which if admitted could lead to the\nimposition of a lesser sentence other than the death penalty. It is forcefully submitted by the Complainants\nthat Article 4 of the African Charter will be violated where a State Party through its judiciary imposes the\ndeath penalty pursuant to an institutionalized process that can result in an innocent person, or a person not\ndeserving of the death penalty, being executed because material facts revealed post-appeal cannot be\nconsidered by the Court.\n117. The Complainants further submit that the reception of such evidence seeks to ensure that only a\nperson, who remains, up to the time of his execution, guilty beyond all reasonable doubts of the crime and\nis deserving of no penalty other than the death sentenced, should be hanged. They argue that if it should\narise prior to the date of his hanging that the certainty of the conviction or appropriateness of the sentence\nis cast into doubt by right thinking people, then such evidence must be investigated and tested, otherwise,\nthey submit, the execution will violate Article 4 of the African Charter.\n118. It is argued by the Complainants that, if before his execution, it can be demonstrated by credible and\ncogent evidence that there was an incorrect conviction or that the condemned man is deserving of a lesser\nsentence than the death penalty, then the right to life protected under Article 4 of the African Charter can\nonly have content if such evidence can be tested. It is contended by the Complainants that the application\nof the doctrine of functus officio to exclude fresh, credible and cogent evidence that could have the effect of\n10\n\n\fa lesser sentence violates Article 4 of the African Charter.\n119. It is averred further by the Complainants that as far as the trial of Kobedi is concerned, this fresh\nevidence includes, crucial ballistic analyses that Sgt. Goepamang was struck by a high velocity firearm, AK\n47, a type used by the police force and not a low velocity firearm, Kalashnikov 9mm, found in possession of\nthe Victim; vital ballistic analyses that Sgt. Goepamang was shot from the side and not from the front as\ncontained in the High Court judgment; and expert medical evidence of gross medical negligence towards\nSgt. Goepamang during his time in hospital.\n120. In arguing that the death penalty cannot be imposed for attempted murder in the Respondent State,\nthe Complainants make the point that even if the culprit/victim with premeditated intent, wished to kill his\nvictim, but the victim was saved by the skills of brilliant doctors, the Court has no power to sentence the\nculprit to death. In the case of Kobedi, they argue that during his trial, crucial expert medical evidence was\nadduced revealing gross medical negligence towards Sgt. Goepamang during his time in hospital and that\nwere it not for gross medical mismanagement by the hospitals and medical staff treating Sgt. Goepamang,\nhe would not have died from the injuries he sustained.\n121. The Complainants further argue that the imposition of the death penalty on Kobedi without recourse to\nany meaningful post-conviction enquiry as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed by the Courts in the\nRespondent State also offends Article 4 of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 5 (Torture, Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment)\n122. The Complainants contend that Kobedi, according to his Medical Report suffers from a weak heart\ncondition. They also state that the Medical Report proves that Kobedi does not only have an A-V shunt but\nalso needs surgery. They inform the African Commission that the Medical Report presents the following\nconditions of Kobedi: left subclavian arteriovenous shunt with no present evidence of heart failure or\narrhythmia; irritable bowel syndrome; and mild degenerative osteoarthritis of the spine. It is\nsubmitted by the Complainants that Kobedi was a sick man whose health condition ought to have been\ntaken into consideration in deciding the method to be adopted for his execution.\n123. The Complainants further submit that the adoption of hanging as a method of executing the death\npenalty, and the failure of the Courts in the Respondent State to have regard to the medical condition of\nKobedi violates Article 5 of the African Charter, not so much because he is aware that his medical ailment\nwill cause him greater and more prolonged agony during the execution than if he were medically fit, but\nalso because execution by hanging exposes the condemned man to a higher likelihood of unnecessarily\npainful and torturous death through strangulation.\n124. The Complainants aver that the post-appeal process dealing with Clemency Petitions also constitutes\na violation of Article 5 of the African Charter in that the victim, his lawyers and family members were not\ninformed of the unsuccessful outcome of the Clemency Petition, thus, depriving the convict and his family\nmembers the important opportunity to have closure with the dignity of their last farewells.\n125. It is submitted by Complainants that the victim had been under the fear of the death penalty for over a\ndecade since he was first arrested and that this prolonged delay constitutes cruel, unusual or degrading\npunishment or treatment for the reason that he lived for an unconscionable amount of time awaiting the\npotential imposition of a death sentence, rendering the victim's execution a violation of Article 5 of the\nAfrican Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 7 (Right to Fair Trial)\n126. The Complainants argue that the death penalty cannot be imposed for attempted murder in the\nRespondent State, and that even if the culprit with premeditated intent, wished to kill his victim, but the\nvictim was saved by the skills of brilliant doctors, the Court has no power to sentence the culprit to death in\nterms of the criminal code of the Respondent State. In further emphasizing that during Kobedi's trial, crucial\nexpert medical evidence was adduced revealing gross medical negligence towards Sgt. Goepamang during\nhis time in hospital and that were it not for gross medical negligence Sgt. Goepamang, would not have\ndied, the Complainants submit that the lawyer who initially represented Mr. Kobedi, not only failed to\nconsider the above aspects, but that he did not also have access to the medical records of the deceased\nand lacked the resources to engage forensic experts.\n127. The Complainants submit that the above situation could only be made possible by one of two reasons;\nthat counsel dealing with the matter at that initial stage did not have the necessary skills and competence\nrequired in defending a death penalty case; or the evidence could not be expected to have been acquired\nby the lawyer at that stage and therefore amounts to new evidence discovered after the appeal. They\n11\n\n\ffurther argue that this lack of competence on the part of counsel vitiated the entire proceedings and\namounted to a breach of the fair trial procedure provided for in Article 7 of the African Charter.\n128. The Complainants also submitted that this fresh evidence was not only critical to the determination of\nKobedi's guilt, and the question whether the death sentence was the most appropriate sentence in the\ncircumstance, but that the refusal by the Court of Appeal of the Respondent State to receive or test the said\nobjective, material and compelling evidence also violated Kobedi's fair trial rights guaranteed under Article\n7 of the African Charter.\n129. The Complainants submit that the test adopted by the Botswana Court of Appeal which required the\nvictim to prove beyond all reasonable doubt on affidavit that the new evidence would upset the conviction,\ninstead of the balance of probability test is overly broad. It is further submitted by the Complainants that\nunder the due process guarantees, the State ought to present evidence in rebuttal of the expert testimony\npresented in favor of Kobedi and that if the State had even presented such contrary expert evidence, there\nwould still have been a need for an expert conference to determine if the experts can resolve points of\ndeparture, failing which the evidence should be tested. It is further argued by the Complainants that the\nnon-compliance with this procedure amounted to a violation of the fair trial rights of the victim protected\nunder Article 7 of the African Charter.\n130. The Complainants contends that by relying on the evidence of an unqualified forensic expert and by\nrefusing to receive and test the evidence of a qualified forensic expert to determine the source and direction\nof the bullet which struck Sgt. Goepamang, amounts to a fundamental miscarriage of justice and thus a\nviolation of Article 7 of the African Charter.\nRespondent State's Submissions on the Merits\n\n131. The Respondent State submits as a preliminary issue, that the procedure adopted by the African\nCommission in dealing with the post-admissibility processes in this Communication contravenes Rule\n119(2) (3) of the African Commission. It contends that by virtue of Rule 119 (2), once the African\nCommission decides on the Admissibility of a Communication, the Respondent State shall file its\nsubmissions without any further reference to the Complainants and the Complainants should only be\nallowed to reply to the State's submission in terms of Rule 119 (3).\n132. It is further contended by the Respondent State that by virtue of the above, the Complainants are\nrequired to disclose the full particulars of their Complaint at the very initial stage. In submitting that the\nAfrican Commission erred when it simultaneously asked both the Complainants and the Respondent State,\nto make their submissions on the Merits, the Respondent State prays the African Commission to purge and\nexpunge from its records any submissions made by the Complainants in this regard.\n133. With regards to the substantive matter, the Respondent State argues that the compulsory requirement\nunder Botswana law for the Courts to impose the death penalty for murder, where no extenuating\ncircumstances are shown; the adoption of the doctrine of \"functus officio\" by the Court of Appeal of the\nRespondent State with regards to the trial of Kobedi and the use of hanging as a method of execution of\nKobedi does not in anyway contravene Articles 2, 3, {{4,4}, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.\nOn the Alleged Violation of Articles 2 and 3 (Right not to be Discriminated and Right to Equality\nbefore the law)\n134. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 2 of the African Charter, the Respondent State submits that\nthis Article deals with the issue of discrimination, and argued further that the legislation in the Respondent\nState did not in any way discriminate against the victim as the death penalty would be imposed on anyone\nfound guilty of murder without any extenuating circumstance.\n135. In reply to the alleged violation of Article 3 of the African Charter, the Respondent State, while noting\nthat this Article deals with the twin concepts of equality before the law and equal protection of the law,\nsubmitted that the victim's right to be treated equally before the law was not interfered with in anyway by\nthe Respondent State throughout the trial process.\n136. Concerning the allegation that the victim was not afforded equal protection of the law, the Respondent\nState contends that Mr. Kobedi was at all times during the trial process provided with high quality legal\nrepresentation and was not treated unequally vis-?-vis any other person in a similar situation. These,\nargues the Respondent State, shows that the allegations of the Complainants with regards to the allege\nviolations of Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter are baseless.\n\n12\n\n\fOn the Alleged Violation of Article 4 (Right to Life)\n137. In response to the alleged violation of Article 4 of the African Charter, it is submitted by the\nRespondent State, that not only is the imposition of the death penalty reasonable in the circumstance, but\nalso that the procedures followed before the death sentence was carried out on Kobedi did not amount to\nthe arbitrary taking of his life. The Respondent State further contends that the trial of Kobedi went through\nthe proper judicial process of the Courts in Botswana and did not at anytime derogate from the procedures\nwhatsoever.\n138. The Respondent State avers that the jurisprudence of the African Commission did not regard the\ndeath penalty as inherently contrary to the African Charter, but rather that such penalty should only be\nimposed with necessary due process safeguards being in place. In referring the Commission to the\nThirteenth Activity Report of the Commission,40 the Respondent State argues that the African Commission\ndid not declare the imposition of the death penalty a contravention of Charter Rights, but urged States that\nstill had the death penalty to among other things limit its imposition only to crimes of the most serious\nnature as well as to consider establishing a moratorium on executions.\n139. The Respondent State argues that because due process was followed and safeguarded by the judicial\nsystem of Botswana in the trial of Kobedi, his execution cannot amount to a contravention of Article 4 of the\nAfrican Charter as alleged by the Complainants.\nOn the Alleged Violation of Article 5 (Torture and Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment)\n140. In view of the alleged violation of Article 5 of the African Charter, the Respondent State, whilst\nreferring the African Commission to Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\nargues that, the death penalty is expressly recognized and not prohibited under international human rights\nlaw. It is averred by the Respondent State that since the African Charter41 provides that the African\nCommission shall draw inspiration from international law and human rights, including international\ninstruments in interpreting Charter Rights, the African Commission should not read Article 5 of the African\nCharter as prohibitive of the death penalty.\n141. It is submitted by the Respondent State that, because the African Charter and other international\ninstruments recognizes the death penalty as a form of punishment, its application cannot amount to\ninhuman or degrading treatment prohibited by Article 5 of the African Charter if it is administered according\nto the law.\n142. It is also argued by the Respondent State that, the Communication does not reveal facts of any\ninhuman conditions or treatment whilst the victim was in prison custody. It submits that even if fear, despair\nand mental anguish are the inevitable concomitants of the sentence of death, the Complainants have not\ndemonstrated that in all circumstances of the case, the delay since the passing of the death penalty\nsentence on the victim goes beyond what is constitutionally permissible. In referring the African\nCommission to Supreme Court decision in Zimbabwe42 it is further argued by the Respondent State that an\nelement of delay between the lawful imposition of a sentence of death and the exhaustion of available\nremedies is inherent in the review of the sentence; thus, even prolonged periods of detention under a\nsevere custodial regime on death row cannot generally be considered to constitute cruel, inhuman or\ndegrading treatment if the convicted person is merely availing himself of appellate remedies. Thus, it is\ncontended that Article 5 of the African Charter has not been violated in any way.\nOn the Alleged Violation of Article 7 (Right to Fair Trial)\n143. In conceding that there was indeed a long delay in the trial of Kobedi, the Respondent State argues\nthat, such delays were occasioned by the defence and not by the State. For example, the Respondent\nState submits that there was a delay of up to six (6) months between July and December 2001 when Mr.\nBrain Spilg SC was appointed pro deo to represent the victim because the victim rejected several pro deo\ncounsels including Mr. Joina and insisted on having Mr. Brain Spilg SC appointed pro deo to represent him.\nAgain, it argues that there was another delay of up to sixteen (16) months between November 1999 and\nJuly 2001 in the trial because no opposing affidavits were filed on behalf of the victim. It is contended by the\nRespondent State that because these delays were due in part by the indolent acts of Kobedi and his\nlawyers, they cannot amount to a contravention of the fair trial rights guaranteed under Article 7(1) (d) of\nthe African Charter.\n144. The Respondent State contends that, in refusing the new evidence from the Complainants the Court\nwas using tried and tested principles of law and was more than sure that this new evidence would not\nchange the out come of the case if a retrial was ordered. In arguing that the trial judge properly exercised\n13\n\n\fhis discretion in refusing to order a retrial, the Respondent State submits that the due process rights of the\nvictim protected under Article 7 of the African Charter was therefore not violated in anyway.\nThe Commission's Decision on the Merits\n\n145. The Respondent State had raised as a preliminary issue challenging any consideration by the African\nCommission of any further submissions filed by the Complainants in terms of Rule 119(2) and Rule 119(3)\nof the African Commission's Rules of Procedure. They argue that by virtue of Rule 119(2) , only the\nRespondent State is required to make submissions after the African Commission's decision on admissibility\nand the Complainants are only accorded a right to reply pursuant to Rule 119(3) . In requesting that the\nsubmissions made by the Complainants in this direction should be expunged, it contends that by requesting\nboth parties to submit their arguments on the Merits, the African Commission did not properly apply Rule\n119(2)& (3) of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\n146. The Complainants on their part did not address the African Commission on this.\nDecision of the African Commission on Alleged Procedural Irregularity\n\n147. In dealing with this issue, the African Commission will refer itself to Rule 119 of the Rules of\nProcedure (1995) of the African Commission which provides:\n[i][quote]\n1. If the Commission decides that a Communication is Admissible under the Charter, its decision and text of\nthe relevant documents shall as soon as possible, be submitted to the State Party concerned, through the\nSecretary. The author of the Communication shall also be informed of the Commission's decision through\nthe Secretary.\n2. The State Party to the Charter concerned shall, within the 3 ensuing months, submit in writing to the\nCommission, explanations or statements elucidating the issue under consideration and indicating, if\npossible, measures it was able to take to remedy the situation.\n3. All explanations or statements submitted by a State Party pursuant to the present Rule shall be\ncommunicated, through the Secretary, to the author of the Communication who may submit in writing\nadditional information and observations within a time limit fixed by the Commission.\n4. States Parties from whom explanations or statements are sought within specified times shall be informed\nthat if they fail to comply within those times the Commission will act on the evidence before it.[/quote][/i]\n148. The African Commission notes that while the afore cited Rule 119(2) only makes reference to the\nState Party, and Rule 119 (3) limits the choice of the Complainants to a reply only, it is important to point\nout here that, the Communication Procedure under the African Charter is dealt with in three distinct phases\n- [b]Seizure, Admissibility and Merits/b]. There are different requirements to be satisfied at each of these\nphases. As such, the African Commission has adopted a practice that does not require the Complainants to\nmake a full submission in their initial address to the African Commission. This is one reason why the\nAfrican Commission will not expunge the submissions on the Merits made by the Complainants.\n149. Furthermore, the African Commission believes that it will only insist on the mechanical application of\nits rules where to do otherwise would occasion substantial injustice to one or both of the parties. The\nRespondent State has not shown that the non-compliance with Rules 119(2)& (3) as it were, has caused a\ntravesty of justice in this case or has in any other way adversely affected their rights. The African\nCommission maintains that the primary duty of all adjudicatory bodies whether national or international, is\nto ensure that substantial justice and not technical justice, is done to all the parties in a case. The African\nCommission will therefore not allow technicalities based on perceived procedural irregularities to stand on\nthe course of justice.\n150. In view of the above, the African Commission holds that the preliminary issue raised by the\nRespondent State lacks merits in the circumstances of this case and will therefore discountenance the\nsame.\nDecision of the African Commission on the Substantive Claim\n\n151. By this Communication, the African Commission has been invited to determine whether or not the\ncompulsory requirement under Botswana law for the courts to impose the death penalty for murder, where\nno extenuating circumstances are shown; the adoption of the doctrine of \"functus officio \"43 by the Court of\n14\n\n\fAppeal of the Respondent State with regards to the trial of Kobedi; and the use of hanging as a method of\nexecution of Kobedi, constitutes a violation of Articles 2, 3, {{4,4}, 5 and 7 of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Articles 2 and 3\n152. Article 2 of the African Charter provides: \"Every individual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the\nrights and freedoms recognized and guaranteed in the present Charter without distinction of any kind such\nas race, ethnic group, color, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin,\nfortune, birth or other status\"\nArticle 3\n1. Every individual shall be equal before the law.\n2. Every individual shall be entitled to equal protection of the law.\n153. Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter, basically forms the anti-discriminatory and equal protection\nprovisions of the African Charter. Whilst Article 2 lays down a principle that is necessary for eradicating\ndiscrimination in all its guises, Article 3 is important because it guarantees fair and just treatment of\nindividuals within the legal system of a given country.\n154. The Complainants argue that the compulsory requirement under Botswana legislation that a Court\nmust impose the death penalty for murder, absent only extenuating circumstance limits the factors that can\nbe taken into consideration in respect of sentencing. They submit that the exclusion of considerations such\nas rehabilitation or such other factors personal to the victim violates Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter.\nIn this regard, they argue that the distinction between taking into account extenuating circumstances and\nnot taking into account mitigating factors is both arbitrary and discriminative.\n155. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 2 of the African Charter, the Respondent State submits that\nthis Article deals with the issue of discrimination, and argued that the legislation in the Respondent State\ndid not in anyway discriminate against the victim as the death penalty would be imposed on anyone found\nguilty of murder without any extenuating circumstance.\n156. In reply to the alleged violation of Article 3 of the African Charter, the Respondent State, while noting\nthat this Article deals with the twin concepts of equality before the law and equal protection of the law,\nsubmitted that the victim's right to be treated equally before the law was not interfered with in anyway by\nthe Respondent State throughout the trial process.\n157. Concerning the allegation that the victim was not afforded equal protection of the law, the Respondent\nState contends that Kobedi was at all times during the trial process provided with high quality legal\nrepresentation and was not treated unequally vis-?-vis any other person in a similar situation. These,\nargues the Respondent State shows that the allegations of the Complainants with regards to the alleged\nviolation of Articles 2 and 3 of the African Charter are baseless.\n158. The African Commission maintains that Article 2 of the African Charter is a guarantee that every\nindividual is entitled to enjoy all the rights provided for under the African Charter and that no person shall be\ndeprived of the enjoyment of any of the Charter rights based on his/her race, ethnic group, color, sex,\nlanguage, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or other status.\nTherefore, for there to be a violation of Article 2 of the African Charter, it must be shown that the victim of\nthe alleged violation has been deprived of the enjoyment of a Charter Right on the basis of his/her race,\nethnic group, color, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune,\nbirth or other status.\n159. The African Commission further believes that the right to equal protection of the law envisaged under\nArticle 3 of the African Charter consists of the right of all persons to have the same access to the law and\nCourts, and to be treated equally by the law and Courts, both in procedures and in the substance of the\nlaw. While it is akin to the right to due process of law, it applies particularly to equal treatment as an\nelement of fundamental fairness.44 It is a guarantee that no person or class of persons shall be denied the\nsame protection of the laws that is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in like circumstances in their\nlives, liberty and property.\n160. The African Commission, therefore, believes that for there to be a violation of Article 3 of the African\nCharter, it must be demonstrated that the victim of the alleged violation was not accorded the same\nprotection or treatment that is usually accorded to other persons in like circumstances.\n161. In the present Communication it has not been shown how the victim was denied the enjoyment of any\nof the Charter Rights based on his ethnic group, color, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion,\nnational and social origin, fortune, birth or other status. It has not also been shown how the victim was\n15\n\n\faccorded differential treatment or how the victim was discriminated against by the Respondent State in\nanyway. Apart from making general conclusions, the Complainants did not sufficiently present facts and\nevidence that would convince the African Commission of any violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the African\nCharter. The African Commission therefore finds that there was no violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the\nAfrican Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 5\n162. According to Article 5 of the African Charter \"every individual shall have the right to the respect of the\ndignity inherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status. All forms of exploitation and\ndegradation of man particularly slavery, slave trade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and\ntreatment shall be prohibited\".\n163. Although the African Charter fails to provide any definition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading\ntreatment, the African Commission in its jurisprudence45 has found that the prohibition of torture, cruel,\ninhuman or degrading treatment includes \"actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering\n(or) humiliate the individual or force him or her to act against his or her will or conscience\".\n164. While it is accepted that there is no rule of international law which prescribes the circumstances under\nwhich the death penalty may be imposed, the African Commission has cautioned that the death penalty\nshould only be imposed after a full consideration of not only the circumstances of the individual offence, but\nalso the circumstances of the individual offender.46\n165. The Complainants have made reference to the fact that the adoption of hanging as a method of\nexecuting the death penalty, and the failure of the Courts in the Respondent State to have regard to the\nmedical condition of Kobedi violates Article 5 of the African Charter.\n166. By invoking Article 60 of the African Charter, the African Commission will rely on the jurisprudence of\nthe UN Human Rights Committee47 to hold that where a death sentence has been imposed, it must be\ncarried out in such a way as to cause the least possible physical and mental suffering. This approach was\napplied in Ng v. Canada48 wherein the UN Committee found that the particular method of gas asphyxiation\namounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.\n167. The African Commission, therefore, believes that, the carrying out of a death sentence using a\nparticular method of execution may amount to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if the\nsuffering caused in execution of the sentence is excessive and goes beyond that is strictly necessary.\n168. The African Commission holds that under the African Charter, a parallel obligation to prevent torture or\nill-treatment derives from the undertaking given by the States Parties in Article 1 thereof \"to adopt\nlegislative or other measures to give effect\" to the rights contained in the Charter. The importance of such\nsafeguards has been recognized by the African Commission in the Robben Island Guidelines.49\n169. The African Commission is of the view that the execution of a death sentence by hanging may not be\ncompatible with respect for the inherent dignity of the individual and the duty to minimize unnecessary\nsuffering, because it is a notoriously slow and painful means of execution. If carried out without appropriate\nattention to the weight of the person condemned because hanging can result either in slow and painful\nstrangulation, because the neck is not immediately broken by the drop, or, at the other extreme, in the\nseparation of the head from the body.\n170. However, the Complainants have not demonstrated that the execution would be, or was, carried out\nwithout due attention to the weight of the condemned. In the circumstance, the African Commission holds\nthat these submissions are speculative and cannot in the circumstance violate Article 5 of the African\nCharter. It is for this reason that the African Commission finds that there has been no violation of Article 5\nof the African Charter in this regard.\n171. It was also contended by the Complainants that because the victim had been under the fear of the\ndeath penalty for over a decade since he was first arrested, this prolonged delay constitute cruel, unusual\nor degrading punishment or treatment for the reason that he lived for an unconscionable amount of time\nawaiting the potential imposition of a death sentence, rendering the victim's execution a violation of Article\n5 of the African Charter.\n172. Whilst the above definition is useful, it fails to outline those categories of actions that would constitute\na violation under Article 5 of the African Charter. To resolve this issue, the African Commission will in terms\nof Article 60 of the African Charter rely on the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee which has\nover the years, made a determination on whether the length of detention on death row amounted to a\nviolation of the prohibition against 'torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'.50 In\nRandolph Barrett and Clyde (sic!) v. Jamaica,51 the Human Rights Committee held that in the review of\n16\n\n\fcriminal convictions and sentences, an element of delay between the lawful imposition of a sentence of\ndeath and the exhaustion of available remedies is inherent in the review of the sentence; thus, even\nprolonged periods of detention under a severe custodial regime on death row cannot generally be\nconsidered to constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment if the convicted person is merely availing\nhimself of appellate remedies.\n173. The African Commission is of the view that the computation of time as far as the delays in executing\nthe sentence is concern, will only start to run from the time the High Court passed the death sentence and\nnot from when the victim was first arrested in 1993. The evidence before the African Commission indicates\nthat the ensuing delay in carrying out the death sentence was because the victim had petitioned the Court\nof Appeal. The victim was partly responsible for these delays and was exercising his rights to appeal. For\nthis reasons the African Commission finds that there is no violation of Article 5 in this regard.\n174. It was submitted by the Complainants that failure to publish the unsuccessful outcome of the clemency\npetition and failure to give notice of the date and time of execution amounts to cruel, inhuman and\ndegrading punishment and treatment in breach of Article 5 of the African Charter as thus, depriving the\nconvict and his family members of the important opportunity to have closure with the dignity of their last\nfarewells.\n175. The Respondent State, failed to challenge the allegation that no reasonable notice or any notice at all\nwas given of the date and time of execution of the victim. The African Commission has in many of its\ndecisions52 held that facts uncontested by the Respondent State shall be considered as established. In\nview of the foregoing, the African Commission will therefore hold this fact as established.\n176. In Communication 240/01 Interights et al. (on behalf of Bosch) v. Botswana53 , the African\nCommission observed that a justice system must have a human face in matters of execution of death\nsentences by affording a condemned person an opportunity to arrange his affairs, to be visited by members\nof his intimate family before he dies, and to receive spiritual advice and comfort to enable him to compose\nhimself, as best as he can, to face his ultimate ordeal.\n177. The African Commission is, therefore, inclined to hold the fact that the victim and his family members\nwere never given the important opportunity to have closure with the dignity of their last farewells as\ninhuman treatment. Since the Respondent State did not give any justifications, the African Commission\nfinds that the failure to give notice of the date and time of execution of the victim amounts to cruel, inhuman\nand degrading punishment and treatment and therefore a violation of Article 5 of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 7\n178. The Complainants contend that the fair trial rights of the victim were violated in that; (a) the Court of\nAppeal misdirected itself by wrongfully invoking the doctrine of functus officio and refusing to order a retrial\nin Kobedi's case in the face of strong, compelling and new contrary expert reports and instead relied on the\ntestimony of an unqualified forensic expert; (b) the right to counsel was not fully respected; (c) there were\ninordinate delays in the trial process; (d) the Court placed a higher standard of proof - beyond reasonable\ndoubts on the victim .\n179. From the arguments and analysis of both the Complainants and the Respondent State, the essential\nquestion that must be asked here is whether the trial of the Kobedi complied with the provisions of Article 7\nof the African Charter.\n180. Article 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights provides that: \"Every individual shall\nhave the right to have his cause heard. This comprises:\n1. The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental rights as\nrecognized and guaranteed by the conventions, laws, regulations, and customs in force;\n2. The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\n3. The right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;\n4. The right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\n]>\n\n17\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"5","date":"December 16, 2011","language":"","type_of_document":"6","mechanism":"","keywords":"Death penalty, Right to life, Torture and ill treatment, Right to fair trial, Discrimination, Equality and equal protection before the law, National law","activity_report":"","outcome":"4"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080b47ca","title":"Marcel Wetsh’okonda Koso and others","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559138453,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"281_03 Marcel Wetsh okonda Koso and others - DRC.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463559140428kzo7f9nzyoh9qkt9.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463559140428kzo7f9nzyoh9qkt9.pdf","size":49619},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"281/03 Marcel Wetsh'okonda Koso and others / DRC\nSummary of Facts\n1. On 23rd September 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights\nreceived from Barrister Marcel Wetsh' Okonda Koso, solicitor of the Kinshasa-Gombe Bench and of the\nNGO Campagne pour les Droits de l'Homme au Congo1 , from Barrister Izua Kembo, solicitor of the\nKinshasa-Gombe Bench and member of the NGO Comité des Observateurs des Droits de l'Homme.2 , and\nfrom Barrister Odette Disu, solicitor and member of the Kinshasa-Gombe Bench, and of the NGO\n\"ASMEBOKEN\"3 a communication, introduced on behalf of 5 persons as follows:\n1. Ngimbi Nkiama Gaby, Contractor, born on 19.04.1958 in Kinshasa;\n2. Bukasa Musenga, Trade Inspector, born on 25.09.1967 in Kinshasa;\n3. Duza Kade Willy, Soldier, born on 30.10.1963 in Lisala;\n4. Issa Yaba, Femala Soldier, born on 10.04.1958 in Irebu; and\n5. Musalinsa Manoy, Soldier, born on 10.05.1958.\n2. The communication is introduced against the Democratic Republic of Congo, (State [party]4 to the\nAfrican Charter, and hereinafter referred to as DRC, in accordance with Article 55 of the African Charter on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights (the African Charter).\n3. The Complainants allege that, on 23.07.1999, the said Ngimbo [sic] Nkiama placed an order for the\nsupply of 3.5 cubic metres of petrol at ELF (a petroleum company) which he was supposed to collect on\n26.06.1999 at SEP/Congo. But the said Ngimbi Nkiama was arrested by policemen who are said to have\ndiscovered a supply of 6 drums in surplus following his collection of 40 drums of fuel instead of the 34\ndrums of fuel he initially ordered for.\n4. Besides, the Complainants maintain that on 04.08.1999 the said Ngimbi Nkiama was arrested and sent\nto the Conseil National de Sécurité quarters together with four jointly accused persons, Bukasa Musenga,\nDuza Kade Willy, Issa Yaba, and Muzaliwa Manoy.\n5. According to the Complainants, on the 11.09.1999, the said Ngimbi Nkiama and the jointly accused\npersons were arraigned before the Military Court of DRC for \"partaking, during war time, in the committing\nof acts of sabotage by the diversion of 70 drums of gas-oil and of 40 drums of gas-oil belonging to the\nCongolese Armed Forces\".\n6. And that the Military Court comprising 5 judges [sic] (among whom would be only one trained jurist) tried\nthe said Ngimbi Nkiama and his jointly accused [sic] accomplices for the evidence adduced against and\nsentenced them to a capital punishment, a \"decree on a ground without the least justification [sic] \" and the\nright to file an appeal against the decree [sic]; the decisions of the Military Court being not [subject] either\nfor a review or for an appeal (Decree No.019 of 23.08.1997 establishing the Military Court of DRC).\n\nThe Complaint\n7. The Complainants allege that the above-mentioned facts constitute a violation by the DRC of Articles 7\n(a) [sic] and Article 26 of the African Charter and of paragraph 3 of the Provision for the right to the means\nof an appeal and of a fair trial [sic]5 , adopted by the African Commission during its 11th Ordinary Session\nheld in Tunis, Tunisia from 2 to 9 March 1992.\n8. Furthermore, the Complainants maintain that the aforementioned facts constitute a violation by the DRC\nof the Article 14(1)\n× All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge\nagainst him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public\nhearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The press and the public\nmay be excluded from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals, public order (ordre public) or national\nsecurity in a democratic society, or when the interest of the private lives of the parties so requires, or to the\nextent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice\nthe interests of justice; but any judgement rendered in a criminal case or in a suit at law shall be made\npublic except where the interest of juvenile persons otherwise requires or the proceedings concern\nmatrimonial disputes or the guardianship of children.\n1\n\n\fof International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n9. Consequently, the Complainants request the African Commission to:\n• Declare Decree No. 019 of 23.08.1997, establishing a court for military order and its Article 5,\ncontrary to the international commitments of the DRC as far as fair trial is concerned as stipulated in\nthe African Charter [sic];\n• Declare that the sole fact of submitting a dispute case to a Court the majority of whose members\nhave no legal qualification whatsoever, constitutes a flagrant violation of Article 26 of the African\nCharter;\n• Declare that the judicial decisions on a simple ground without the least justification grossly breach\nthe right and liberties acknowledged by the African Charter and violate the provisions of Article 7 of\nthis latter;\n• Direct the immediate release of the sentenced persons and the reparation for all the prejudices they\nhave suffered;\n• Request the DRC to harmonise all her legislation with the commitments this state subscribed to at\ninternational level and namely the African Charter and to initiate reforms so as to prevent further\nhuman right violations.\n\nProcedure\n10. On 21.10.2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of this communication\nto the Complainants through a letter with reference No. ACHPR/COMM 281/2003.\n11. During its 34th Ordinary Session held from the 6th to 19th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nAfrican Commission examined this communication and approved its seizure.\n12. On the 14/12/2003, the African Commission notified the Respondent State of this decision by DHL, and\nat the same time conveyed to it a copy of the complaint. The African Commission also requested the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo to provide it, in two months, with its [arguments] on this complaint to enable\nit take a decision on its admissibility during its 35th Ordinary Session.\n13. On the 12th February 2004 and in the absence of any reaction from the Respondent State, the African\nCommission sent a copy of the complaint in question with an acknowledgement of receipt to the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs, requesting its reaction as early as possible.\n14. At its 35th Ordinary Session which was held from the 21st May to 4th June 2004 in Banjul, The Gambia,\nthe African Commission considered the communication and deferred its decision on the admissibility of the\ncase since the delegation of the Respondent State that participated at the session declared, contrary to all\nexpectations, that the complaint had not reached the DRC.\n15. The Secretariat of the Commission prepared a complete dossier of all the pending communications\nagainst the DRC, including Communication 281/2003, which it delivered in exchange for a receipt, to the\nDRC delegation.\n16. By letter dated 21st June 2004, the Secretariat of the Commission informed the parties to the\ncommunication of the deferment of its decision on the admissibility of the complaint to its 36th Session and\nrequested them, once again, to provide it with their comments in this regard so as to allow the African\nCommission to rule on the admissibility during its 36th Session.\n17. On the 16/09/2004, the Respondent State sent its comments on the admissibility of the communication\nto the Secretariat of the Commission.\n18. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of it on the 11/10/2004, and sent the said comments to the\nComplainant requesting his reaction thereon as early as possible.\n19. During the 36th Ordinary Session of the African Commission which was held in November/December\n2004 in Dakar, Senegal, the Respondent State submitted its memorandum on the admissibility of the\nComplaint to the Secretariat of the African Commission.\n20. On the 4th December 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of this\nmemorandum and informed the Respondent State that the African Commission would take its decision on\nadmissibility of the complaint at its 37th Ordinary Session and the arguments raised would be taken into\naccount.\n\n2\n\n\f21. On the 23rd December 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission conveyed the submission of the\nRespondent State on admissibility to the Complainant, and requested his reaction to the arguments\nsubmitted therein and further informed him that the African Commission would take its decision on the\nadmissibility during its 37th Ordinary Session.\n22. At its 37th Ordinary Session which took place from the 27th April to 11th May 2005 in Banjul, The\nGambia, the African Commission heard the Complainant on the condition of the exhaustion of local\nremedies.\n23. During this same session, the African Commission declared the communication admissible.\n24. On the 6th June 2005, the Secretariat informed the parties of this decision and requested them to\ntransmit their arguments on the merits of the case.\n25. On the 6th September 2005, the Complainant submitted his arguments on the merits of the complaint.\n26. The Secretariat conveyed these observations to the Respondent State on the 8th November 2005 at the\nsame time requesting its own memorandum as early as possible.\n27. During its 38th Ordinary Session, which was held from 21 November to 5 December 2005 in Banjul, The\nGambia, the African Commission considered the complaint and, in the absence of the arguments of the\nRespondent State on the merits of the case, decided to differ [sic] its decision at this stage to its 39th\nOrdinary Session.\n28. On 10/01/2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties of this decision and\nrequested the Respondent State to forward its arguments on the merits of the communication.\n29. In the absence of reaction from the Respondent State, the Secretariat sent a reminder on 28/03/2006.\nA copy of the submission of the Complainant on merits of the case was enclosed.\n30. In a Note Verbale dated July 12, 2006, the Secretariat urged DRC to provide with its observations on\nthe merits by no later than 30th August 2006. The Secretariat further reminded DRC of previous notes\nverbale sent respectively on June 06, 2005, November 08, 2005 and January 10, 2006 all of which still with\nno reaction from Respondent State.\n31. At its 40th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, the Gambia from 15 to 29 November 2006, the Commission\ndeferred its decision on the merits to its 41st Ordinary Session scheduled to be held in Ghana from 16 to 30\nMay 2007 owing to the absence of arguments on the merits from the Respondent State.\n32. On 15 January 2007, the Secretariat informed DRC of the decision of the Commission to differ [sic] the\ncomplaint to its 41st Ordinary Session and reminded DRC of previous notes verbale in which DRC was\ninvited to send its observations on the merits. However, DRC was given the last chance to formulate and\nsend its observations on the merits before the end of February 2007, failing to do so would result in the\nCommission having to act in accordance with Article 119(4) of its rules of procedure.\n33. On 16 January 2007, the Secretariat informed the Complainants of the postponement of its decision on\nthe merits to the 41st Ordinary Session scheduled to be held from 16 to 30 May 2007 in Ghana. The\nSecretariat informed also the Complainants that DRC was given a last chance to provide the Commission\nwith its arguments on the merits failing of which, the Commission would be obliged to act in accordance\nwith Article 119(4) of its rules of procedure.\n34. In a Note Verbale dated June 14 2007, the Secretariat of the Commission informed the Defendant State\nthat the communication was deferred to the 42nd Ordinary [Session] scheduled from 14 to 28 November\n2007 in Brazzaville, Congo. The State was also reminded of previous note verbales in which it was urged to\nsubmit it arguments as regard to the merit of the communication and that failing to do so may result in the\napplication of Rule 119(4) of the rule of procedure. The Respondent State is still yet to respond to these\nNotes Verbale.\n35. A letter dated June 15, 2007 the Secretariat informed the Complainant of the deferment of the\ncommunication to the 42nd Ordinary Session scheduled from 14 to 28 November 2007 in Brazzaville,\nCongo\n36. In a Note Verbale dated 17 September 2007 and a letter dated 17 September 2007 the Secretariat of\nthe African Commission also sent a reminder both to the Complainant and the Defendant State.\n37. By Note Verbale dated 20 March 2008 and a letter dated 19 December 2007 respectively, the parties\nwere informed of the deferment of the communication to the 43rd Ordinary Session scheduled in Ezulwini,\nSwaziland from 7th to 22nd May 2008 for the Commission to take into consideration in its decision on the\nmerits, the conclusions submitted by the DRC on the merits.\n38. In a Note Verbale dated 20 March 2008 and a letter dated 19 March 2008, reminders were sent to the\nparties to inform them of the deferment of the communication to the 43rd Ordinary Session.\n\n3\n\n\f39. All attempts at getting responses from the Respondent State have been futile (or unsuccessful).\nTherefore, the Commission decided to consider the communication on the merits.\n40. During its 5th Extra Ordinary Session, which took place in Banjul, The Gambia from 21 to 29 July 2008,\nthe African Commission considered the communication and finalised its decision on the merits.\n\nThe Law\nAdmissibility\nOn the exhaustion of local remedies\n\n41. The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights stipulates in its Article 56 that the communications\nreferred to in Article 55 should, if they are to be considered, necessarily be sent after exhaustion of local\nremedies, if they exist, unless the procedure of exhaustion of local remedies is unduly prolonged.\n42. In its memorandum on admissibility, the Respondent State contends that as far as it is concerned the\ncommunication should be declared inadmissible. In support of this position the Respondent State affirms\nthat the Complainant \"does not provide evidence of having lodged an appeal against the ruling in dispute,\nwhereas this means of recourse remains open, in conformity with Article 150, paragraph 3 of the\nTransitional Constitution in the Democratic Republic of Congo\".\n43. According to the Respondent State, it was possible for the Complainants to lodge an appeal before the\nSupreme Court of Justice against all rulings by the Military Tribunal which are in dispute, and that, by not\nusing this remedy, the Complainant has not exhausted the available remedies and therefore, it requests the\nAfrican Commission to declare the communication inadmissible for non exhaustion of local remedies.\n44. In a memorandum conveyed to the Secretariat of the African Commission on the 17th April 2005, the\nComplainant insisted on the non existence of remedies at the time when the facts occurred. They contend\nthat the sentences passed by the Military Tribunal with regard to them cannot be subjected to any\nremedies. In effect Article 5 of Decree 019 of the 23rd August 1997 establishing the Military Tribunal\nstipulates that its rulings \"can neither be opposed nor appealed\".\n45. They contend that an eventual recourse to cancellation of the judgment in question, although provided\nfor by Article 272 of the Law of 23rd August 1972 instituting the Code of Military Justice, cannot be\nimplemented due lack of \"jurisdictional competence\" ; insofar as they could have brought an appeal before\nthe Supreme Court if the facts, which date back to 1999 were not prior to the Transitional Constitution\nwhich was adopted on 4th April 2003 and made it possible for citizens to appeal against the rulings of the\nMilitary Tribunal.\n46. The Complainant contends that the Transitional Constitution Decree of the 9th April 1994 (in force at the\ntime of the events - 1999) stipulates in its Article 102 that: \"The Supreme Court of Justice\nknows......appeals lodged against rulings passed in the final jurisdiction by the Courts and Tribunals\" does\nnot take into consideration the decisions of the Military Tribunal.\n47. The Complainant considers therefore that local remedies were not available by the time the facts\noccurred.\n48. At the 37th Ordinary Session of the African Commission which was held from the 27th April to 11th May\n2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the Complainant made an oral presentation before the African Commission in\nreiteration of these arguments.\nPosition of the African Commission\n\n49. The main question regarding the admissibility of the case under consideration is whether local remedies\nwere in existence at the time when the facts occurred and, if yes, whether they have been exhausted\npursuant to Article 56(6)) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.\n50. In effect, Article 56(6) provides that communications \"are submitted within a reasonable period from the\ntime local remedies are exhausted or from the date the Commission is seized with the matter\".\n51. The African Commission is of the view that if such important facts are within the jurisdiction of an\nexceptional jurisdiction all legal guarantees shall be given to the accused persons for their defence in order\nto avoid any miscarriage of justice. That is the rationale for having remedies in all procedures, especially in\ncriminal procedure. All the ordinary remedies shall be available to them.\n\n4\n\n\f52. An analysis of Article 150, paragraph 3 of the Transitional Constitution of 4th April 2003 on which the\nRespondent State relies shows that the Transitional Constitution was passed after the facts and also after\nthe decision sentencing the complainants. In such circumstances, the Commission is of the view that\napplying such a law of a general scope would violate the principle of non-retrospectiveness of the law,\nespecially as the new Transitional Constitution Decree does not expressly provide for such remedy.\n53. In the present communication, it is the State that alleges that local remedies have not been exhausted\nand as such the burden is on it to show that local remedies exist. It observes that such remedy is available\nunder Decree 019 of 23 August 1997 establishing the Military Tribunal; Article 5 of the Decree expressly\nprovides that the rulings of the latter \"can neither be opposed nor appealed.\" Thus, it appears that the\nDecree includes a derogatory [sic] clause which precludes any opposition or appeal against the rulings of\nbodies such as the Military Tribunal. In other terms, the applicable law at the time the facts occurred does\nnot provide any remedy. In a similar situation, the African Commission, drawing inspiration from its own\nwell-established jurisprudence, already held, in Communications 102/93 Constitutional Rights\nProject/Nigeria, 129/94 Civil Liberties Organisation c/Nigeria and other communications6 , that \"it is\nreasonable to assume that the local remedies would not only be prolonged, but they will produce any\nresult\" [sic] .\n54. Moreover, the same analysis can apply to the other common remedy, namely the lodging of an appeal\nwith the Supreme Court. In terms of the Transitional Constitution Decree of 9th April 1994 (in force at the\ntime the facts occurred - 1999), Article 102 of which provides that \"the Supreme Court of Justice could only\nknow of appeals lodged against rulings passed in final jurisdiction by the Courts and Tribunals\" is only\navailable in common offences.\n55. In consequence, the African Commission rules that local remedies were not available to the\nComplainants. It will apply its jurisprudence on exhaustion of local remedies7 without it necessarily seeking\nto establish the effectiveness of local remedies; the Commission is of the view that it was absolutely\nimpossible for the victims to exhaust effective local remedies.\n56. On these grounds, the African Commission declares the communication admissible.\nMerits\n57. In accordance with Rule 120of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission, where a\ncommunication submitted in accordance with Article 55 of the Charter has been declared admissible, the\nCommission \"shall consider the communication in the light of all the information that the individual and the\nState party concerned have submitted in writing, it shall make known its observation on this issue.\"\n58. In the present case, the conclusions brought to the dossier by the two parties both in terms of the\nprocedure and on the merits of the case enable the Commission to make pronouncements through the\npresentation and analysis of the arguments of the parties to the suit.\nArguments of the Complainants\n\n59. The Complainants submit the violation of the African Charter in its Articles 7.a, 7.b, 7.d and 26. The\nComplainants contest the legal basis, the competence, and the procedure of the Military Court which\ncontravenes the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights to which the Respondent State is a party.\n60. The Complainant avers that the establishment of the Military Court contravenes Article 96 (1) of the\nTransitional Constitution which stipulates that \"courts, tribunals and war councils shall only be established\nby the Law. No special commissions or tribunals shall be set up in any form whatsoever.\"\n61. The Complainant contends the incompetence of the said court due to its membership whose partiality\nwas manifested by the inclusion of members of the military corps, what with their legendary regimentation\nand discipline, exacerbated by the fact that the later lacked the qualities of a magistrate. To support these\nassertions, the Complainant recalled the decision of Communication 218/988 in which the African\nCommission decided that the \"Military tribunal\" should be bound by the norms of equity, transparency,\njustice, independent rules and respect for the legal process of other courts.\"\n62. The Complainant also avers that the procedural situation was exacerbated by the excessive powers of\nthe members of the court who purportedly, followed a very arbitrary procedure in violation of Article 137 of\nthe Military Code of Justice, dated 25 September, according to which, \"the procedure before military\njurisdictions shall be that in force before the common law jurisdictions, in conformity with the provisions of\nthe normal Criminal Code which are not incompatible with those of the present code.\"\n5\n\n\f63. According to the Complainants, there is no possible redress allowing them to contest the decision of the\ncourt which sentenced the plaintiffs to death: according to Article 5 of the decree-law establishing the said\ncourt, neither can the decisions be appealed against nor opposed. The Complainants contend that the\nsentencing of the plaintiffs to death without the possibility of appeal constitutes a violation of Article 6 of the\nGuarantees for the Protection of Persons Sentenced to Death. Article 6 stipulates that \"any individual\nsentenced to death is entitled to file an appeal with a higher court, and measures should be taken to ensure\nthat the appeals are mandatory.\"\n64. The Complainants also recalled the ruling of the Human Rights Committee in the case of Arutynyam\nvs Uzbekistan which states \"sentencing to death following a trial during which the provisions of the\nConvention were not respected constitutes a violation of Article 6 of the Convention where no further\nappeal can be brought against the verdict\" 9\n65. The Complainant further avers that the said ruling of the court was not reasoned considering that the\nauthorities refused to convey to the plaintiffs the ruling pronouncing their sentence despite all the attempts\nto that effect.\n66. Consequently, the Complainants call for the immediate release of the plaintiffs and prays the African\nCommission to call on the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to grant each victim the sum\nof 10, 000, 000 Congolese Francs as damages and to urge it to harmonise its legislation with its\ninternational commitments.\nArguments of the Respondent State\n\n67. The State refutes all the allegations of the Complainants. The State submits that all the said allegations\nare unfounded.\n68. Pertaining to the establishment of the Military Court whose impartiality, independence and competence\nare being challenged by the Complainant, the DRC State responded that the decision to establish a Military\nCourt was in conformity with Article 156 (2) of the Constitution which empowers the Head of State to\nsuspend Common Law Courts in the some or all parts of the territory, and to replace them by Military\nCourts in times of war. As the Congolese state was engaged in an armed conflict situation following the\narmed aggression led by its neighbours, the State was merely implementing the said provisions of the\nConstitution.\n69. The Respondent State observes that it is under these special circumstances that the plaintiffs were\ntried and sentenced in all legality and avers that the latter have not adduced any proof of their assertion\nthat the ruling as passed was not reasoned.\n70. Regarding the complaint brought by the Complainants pertaining to Article 5 of the decree-law\nestablishing the Military Court, the Respondent State alleges that the Complainants could have lodged an\nappeal to bring to the fore their allegations, in accordance with Article 150 of the Transitional Constitution,\nwhich recognises the competence of the Supreme Court to sit on decisions made by the lowest and highest\ncourts.\n71. The Respondent State concludes that there is no room for compensation as the plaintiffs were found\nguilty, and eventually released from custody.\n72. The Congolese State further alleges that it has subsequently harmonised its laws with its international\ncommitments.\nObservations of the Commission\n\n73. In the light of the observations of the parties, it transpires that the main issue here relates to the\nguarantee mechanism, as provided for under Articles 7(1) and 26 of the Charter.\n74. In terms of Article 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights: \"Every individual shall have\nthe right to have his cause heard. This comprises:\na) The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental rights as\nrecognised and guaranteed by the conventions, laws, regulations, and customs in force;\nb) The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\nc) The right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;\nd) The right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\"\n75. Article 26 provides that: \"State Parties to the present charter shall have the duty to guarantee the\nindependence of the Courts and allow the establishment and improvement of appropriate national\ninstitutions entrusted with the promotion and protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the\n6\n\n\fpresent Charter.\">\n76. The general content of the guarantee of sound justice which is the subject of Articles 7 and 26 brings\ntwo sorts of obligations to bear. The obligation of having an accessible and appropriate court and the\nobligation of a fair trial (the right to have one's cause heard fairly). The right to a fair trial is a corollary of the\nconcept of access to an appropriate court. The right to a fair trial requires that one's cause be held by\nefficient and impartial courts.\n77. In a similar case relating to Communication 151/96 Civil Liberties Organisation v. Nigeria, the\nCommission already read Articles 7 and 26, together and held that Article 7 deals with the right to be heard\nby impartial courts, and Article 26 insists on the independence of courts; the Commission notes that States\nhave the duty to put in place credible institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights. Article\n26 being the necessary appendix of Article 7, one can expect a fair trial only before impartial courts.\n78. In the present case, the establishment of the exceptional tribunal is a violation of the provisions of the\nCharter, as already decided by the African Commission in the above-mentioned similar cases.\n79. According to the African Commission, the independence of a court refers to the independence of the\ncourt vis-?-vis the Executive. This implies the consideration of the mode of designation of its members, the\nduration of their mandate, the existence of protection against external pressures and the issue of real or\nperceived independence: as the saying goes \"justice must not only be done: it must be seen to be done\"10 .\n80. The obligation to be independent is one and the same as the obligation to be impartial.11 Impartiality\nmay be perceived in a subjective and objective manner. In a subjective manner, the impartiality of a judge\nis gauged by his internal inclinations. Since it is impossible to infer from this inclination objectively, it was\nsimpler to conclude that subjective impartiality be assumed until proven otherwise 12 .\n81. However, appearances cannot be ignored while gauging the impartiality of a jurisdiction13 .\n82. The obligation of having a jurisdiction established by law, capable of passing a judgement cannot be\nclearly disassociated from the above. The ability of a court to rule depends on the competence of the court\nto hear a case, and also depends on the calibre of its members. In the case of Amnesty International\nVersus Sudan, the Commission decided \"that the definition of the word,\"competence\" is particularly\nsensitive since ................ depriving courts of qualified staff to guarantee their impartiality, infringes\non the right to have one's cause heard by competent organs ........... constitutes a violation of\nArticles 7.1.d and 26 of the Charter\". The requirement of a fair trial presupposes that the parties to the\nsuit are able to present their respective cases without prejudice to either party. The flaws of a trial can be\ndetected where a certain number of elements combined together have not been respected viz. the right to\nequality of means and the need for dissenting views. The requirements of a fair trial also presupposes that\nthe courts are able to allow persons subject to trial to review the ruling passed. The principle of a two-tier\ncourt system is recognised by all. In the present case, there is a discriminatory justice system in the same\nthat Article 5 applies differently depending on the persons concerned.\n83. In the present case, the Military Court was established by a decree-law in accordance with Article\n156(2) of the Constitution of Congo which authorises the President of the Republic to suspend the\nCommon Law courts and replace them with Military Tribunals, in times of war. Its competence includes\nknowing of the deeds of civilians.\n84. Regarding such situations, the Commission already stated several times its Resolution No\nACHPR/Res.41(XXVI)99 on the right to a fair trial. In the Forum of Conscience v. Sierra Leone case, for\ninstance, the Commission quoted the preceding Resolution as follows: \"In many African countries, Military\nTribunals and Special Courts co-exist with ordinary legal institutions. The objective of the military tribunals\nis to adjudicate on offences of a purely military nature perpetrated by military personnel. In the dispatch of\nthese duties, the military tribunals should abide by the norms governing a fair trial\".\n85. Consequently, in this particular case, the fact that civilians and soldiers accused of civilian offences are\ntried by a Military Court presided over by military officers for the theft of drums of gas oil is a flagrant\nviolation of the above-mentioned requirements of good justice.\n86. Furthermore, in its ruling on the Media Rights Agenda v Nigeria case, the Commission decided as\nfollows: [quote]\"the appearance, sentencing and conviction of Malaolu, a civilian, by a special\nmilitary court, presided over by military officers in active duty is nothing short of a violation of the\nfundamental tenets of free trial as stipulated under Article 7 of the Charter.\"[quote]\n87. Consequently, in the present case, the trial of both civilian and militaries [sic] by a military tribunal\npresided over by a military officer on matters of a civilian nature constitutes an infringement of the\nrequirements of fair justice as mentioned earlier.14\n\n7\n\n\f88. The Respondent State does not challenge these arguments in its statement of defence. In the absence\nof any facts to the contrary, the Commission cannot invalidate the submission by the Complainants\nregarding the inexistence of a fair justice system.\n89. The Commission therefore finds that the verdict of the Military Court which consisted solely of Army\nOfficers with no qualities of a Magistrate, did not offer the guarantees of independence, impartiality and\nequity and constitutes a violation of its Resolution No ACHPR/Res.41(XXVI)99 on the Right to a Fair Trial\nand Legal Aid in Africa.\n90. The Complainants allege that the verdict of the military court against the plaintiffs was not reasoned and\nthat to compound matters, the authorities refused to serve them with a copy of the judgement. The\nRespondent State begs to differ and avers that the Complainant has no proof to back this allegation. In this\ncase, the burden of proof is on the Defendant to show that the allegations of the Complainants are\nunfounded by providing the Commission with the said judgement, which proof is yet to be provided. The\nCommission has always deplored lack or inadequacy of motives for legal decisions as a violation of the\nright to a fair trial. In the judgement on the Pinkey v Canada case, the Human Rights Committee ruled:\n\"the exercise of an appellant's right of appeal had been prejudiced because the transcript of the lower\ncourt's proceedings had taken two-and-a-half years to be produced.\"\n91. It is important to note that the Complainants skew the doctrinal meaning of the expression \"effective\nredress\". This expression \"effective redress\" is clearly referred to in Article 13\n× Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective\nremedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting\nin an official capacity.\nof the European Convention on Human Rights. \"Redress\" should not be considered as \"the process\nwhereby a new decision is obtained in a dispute where an authority has already given a ruling. The word\nredress shall comprise of all processes through which a constitutive act or an alleged violation of the\nConvention is brought before a qualified body to seek, as the case maybe, suspension of the act, its\nannulment, amendment or compensation\".15 It is the case in the present communication, even though it is\nhappening at the African regional level.\n92. In addition, the Complainants recall that they could not exhaust adequate local remedies as already\ndealt with at the admissibility stage.\n93. Regarding Article 14 (5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which stipulates that\n\"any person found guilty of an offence shall have the right to have the verdict examined by a higher court,\nin accordance with the law\", the Commission could refer to it in terms of Article 60 of the African Charter on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights. However, nothing in the dossier shows that the Respondent State adopted\nand ratified the Covenant. The Commission can therefore not examine the request.\n57. [sic] Finally, there is no evidence that the victims were released from prison; in the same vein, there is\nno evidence that the Respondent State has already harmonised its legislation with its international\ncommitments. However, the fact that the mere fact of recognising that its legislation is not in line with its\ninternational commitments is a confession of its culpability.\n\nHolding\n\nOn these grounds, the Commission,\n94. Consequently, declares, the Democratic Republic of Congo has violated the relevant provisions of the\nAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, namely Articles 7(a), 7(b), 7(d) and 26.\n95. Finds that the establishment of a Military Court, albeit legally, whose competence extends to hearing\ncivil acts perpetrated by civilians is a flagrant ignorance of the Article 7 of the African Charter on Human\nand Peoples' Rights.\n96. Recommends that the Government of the Republic of Congo guarantees the independence of the\ntribunals and improves on the appropriate national institutions charged with the promotion and protection of\nthe rights and freedoms enshrined in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.\n97. Urges the Government of the DRC to grant the victims a fair and equitable amount as compensation for\nthe moral wrong suffered.\n\n8\n\n\f98. Recommends to the Government of the DRC to harmonise its legislation with its international\ncommitments, if that has not yet been done.\n\nDone in Abuja, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on 24th November 2008.\n\nFootnotes\n1 CDHC- Asbl, 18 Avenue Basoko, commune of Ngaliema, Telephone: 00243 98186937.\n2 [sic] African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights since October, 2001 (30th Ordinary Session).\nCODHO, Kinshasa-Gombe, commune of Kalamu, Telephone: 00243 9947822.\n3 Association Benjamin Moloise and Ken Saro Wiwa for the Defence of Human Rights and the\nDevelopment of Africa, 4251, Avenue Kabasele Tshamala- Kinshasa Barumbu Telephone 0024398212201;\nEmail: groupestrategique@yahoo.co, disuodette@yahoo.fr\n4 The DRC ratified the African Charter on 20/07/1984).\n5 Editor's note: The document being referred to is inferred to be Resolution on the Right to Recourse and\nFair Trial (1992) ACHPR /Res.4(XI)92\n6 102/93 Constitutional Rights Project, 129/94 Civil Liberties Organisation/Nigeria\n7 Civil Liberties Organisation, Legal Defence Center and Assistance Project v.

The communication is submitted by Amnesty International on behalf of William Steven Banda and John\nLyson Chinula.\n2. Complainant alleges that Zambia has violated the provisions of African Charter in that:\n3. Mr William Steven Banda was served with a deportation order on 10th November 1991. The reason given\nwas that \"in my opinion by his presence he (is) likely to be a danger to peace and good order in Zambia\".\nHe contested the order through the courts of Zambia.\n4. On 25th October 1994, William Steven Banda was deported to Malawi unlawfully, wrongfully and out of\npolitical malice. He alleges that he was blindfolded and drugged, driven by Zambian immigration service\nand para-military police officers. He entered Malawi through Mchinji border post and later dumped at\nLilongwe Police station.\n5. John Luson Chinula was removed from his home in Ndola on 31st August 1994. He was driven to Lusaka\nInternational Airport with the intention of deporting him. He was served with a deportation order signed by\nthe Minister of Home Affairs alleging that he was a threat to Zambia's peace and security. He was forcibly\nsedated and later found himself at Lilongwe Police station in Malawi. His Warrant of Deportation also\nalleged that he was \"by his presence, likely to be a danger to peace and good order in Zambia\". No reason\nin law or in fact was advanced for this finding.\n6. Both Complainants were prominent political figures in Zambia. They were leading members of UNIP, the\nparty that had been in power since Independence in 1964. UNIP was defeated by MMD in the first\nmulti-party elections of November 1991.\n7. William Steven Banda exhausted all domestic remedies in that, his matter went to the Supreme Court of\nZambia. John Lyson Chinula could not effect any remedies through the Zambian courts because he was\ndeported and was given no opportunity to approach the Zambian courts.\n8. It is alleged by the Complainant that prior to his forcible expulsion from Zambia under order of\ndeportation, William Banda exhausted local remedies through his appeal to the High Court of Zambia in\n1992 and the Supreme Court of Zambia in 1994.\n9. Complainant alleges that the Zambian government's deportation of the two men amounted to \"forcible\nexile\".\n10. Complainant alleges that attempts to seek redress through existing national legal remedies both in\nZambia and in Malawi have been futile.\n11. Complainant also charges that John Chinula was not allowed recourse to the national courts of Zambia.\nHe was prevented from returning to Zambia by threats of imprisonment by the Zambian authorities.\n12. Complainant states that Banda and Chinula have obtained two judgements at the High Court of Malawi\nconfirming that they were not citizens of Malawi. The government of Malawi has failed to comply with the\njudgement of the Court which ordered that they be assured to return to Zambia. They have therefore\nexhausted all available local remedies at their disposal.\n13. Complainant prays that the Commission adopt Rule 111 interim measures to allow the deportees to\nreturn to Zambia immediately.\n\nComplaint\n14. Complainant alleges that Articles 2, 5, 7(1)(a), 8, 9, 9(2), 10, 12(2), 13(1), 18(1), 18(2) of the African\nCharter have been violated.\n\n1\n\n\fProcedure\n15. Communication is dated 6th March 1998 and was sent by mail.\n16. On 18th March 1998, a letter was sent to the Complainant acknowledging receipt.\n17. At its 23rd Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the Commission decided to be seized of this\nmatter and declared the communication admissible. The Commission also requested that provisional\nmeasures be adopted by the Government of Zambia, namely to allow the burial of Mr John L. Chinula, in\nZambia and the return of Mr William S. Banda to his family in Zambia pending the finalisation of the matter\nby the Commission.\n18. On 10th July 1998, the Secretariat of the Commission wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zambia,\ninforming them of the decision of the 23rd Ordinary Session, drawing attention to the Rule 111 request for\nprovisional measures to be taken by the government of Zambia.\n19. A copy of the Note was also sent to the Embassy of Zambia in Addis Ababa. When there was no reply,\nthe Secretariat sent a reminder on 17th September 1998. The Embassy replied on 21st September that the\nNote Verbale was received but did not enclose the communication referred to.\n20. The representative of the Government of Zambia appeared before the Commission on 26th and 27th of\nOctober 1998 at the 24th Ordinary Session. He presented a statement in response to the communication.\n21. At the 24th Ordinary Session, the Commission postponed consideration of this for a decision on the\nmerits to the next session.\n22. On 26th November 1998, the Secretariat conveyed the decision of the Commission to the parties\nconcerned.\n23. In preparation for a hearing on this matter, the Rapporteur for this communication requested the parties\nto address only some of the critical matters he had identified. Mr Ahmed Motala represented Amnesty\nInternational. Mr Clifford Msika of the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation, Lilongwe, Malawi,\nassisted him. Mr William Steven Banda was also present. The Zambian Government was represented by\nMr Palan Mulonda, Senior State Advocate in the Ministry of Legal Affairs accompanied by Mr K.K.\nNsemukila, Deputy Permanent Secretary, Home Affairs Department and Ms Lucy M. Mungoma of Foreign\nAffairs Department with responsibility for Africa and OAU relations. The Commission also heard testimony\nfrom Mr William Steven Banda.\nArgument\n24. Mr Motala argued that Zambia was bound by the African Charter which it ratified in 1984. It, therefore,\nwas obliged to extend the rights in the Charter to \"every individual\" except where political rights are\nspecifically indicated as in Article 13 for example. He argued that Zambia was in violation of Article 12\nespecially sub-article 2 which provides that \"every individual\" has a right to leave one's country and to\nreturn. It also says that a \"non-national legally admitted in a territory of a State Party may only be expelled\nfrom it by virtue of a decision taken in accordance with the law...\". He alleged discrimination on the basis of\nethnic group and social origin (Article 2) and on the basis of political opinion. The treatment the\nComplainants received violated the victims' rights to human dignity and freedom of movement. In the case\nof Chinula, he was deprived of the right to have his cause heard (Article 7). He insisted that the actions\nagainst Complainants were politically motivated. They have been left in a strange country destitute.\n25. Mr Mulonda, for the government, stated that the government did not act with political malice. It acted\nwithin the law. The investigations against Banda began in 1976 and against Chinula in 1974 long before the\npresent regime came into power. He denied that the deportees were drugged and dumped across the\nborder. He stated that the Malawi authorities received them. The government of Zambia was acting within\nits sovereign rights in ordering its internal affairs, regulating immigration and was within the provision or\nlimitation of the right stipulated in Article 12: \"This right may only be subject to restriction as provided for by\nlaw for the protection of nation security, law and order, public health and morality\".\n\n2\n\n\fLaw\nAdmissibility\n26. Admissibility of communications under the African Charter is governed by Article 56, which sets out\nconditions that must be met before they are considered by the Commission.\n27. Article 56 of the Charter reads:\nCommunications ... shall be considered if they: ...(5) are sent after exhausting local remedies, if unless it is\nobvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged.\n28. This provision of the Charter is necessarily first considered before any substantive consideration of a\ncomplaint.\n29. In the present case all local remedies have been exhausted and there is documentary evidence made\navailable to the Secretariat of the Commission in support of this claim. As already stated in the case of\nChinula, the arbitrary deportation prevented him from exercising this right.\n30. The Complainant has attached to the communication copies of the following judgements/orders\nobtained by William Banda and John Chinula;\n31. Consent Order of 13th March 1995, High Court of Lilongwe, in Miscellaneous Cause No. 2 of 1995;\n32. Judgement of 30th June 1997, High Court of Malawi in Lilongwe, in Miscellaneous Cause No. 2 of 1995;\n33. Judgement No. 16 of 1994, Supreme Court of Zambia in Lusaka, in Banda vs. Chief Immigration Officer\nand Attorney General;\n34. Judgement No. JH/12 of 1991, High Court of Zambia in Chipata, in Banda vs Chief Immigration Officer\nand Attorney General.\nFor these reasons the Commission declares the communication admissible.\n\nMerits\n35. Zambia ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights in January 1984.\n36. A number of supporting documents were submitted: On Banda, the transcript of the Judgement by\nKakusa J in the High Court of Zambia held at Chipata; the judgement on appeal by Bweupe DCJ in the\nSupreme Court in Lusaka. The various decisions of the Malawi Court and affidavits submitted in support.\nThe Government also submitted documents on Banda and Chinula.\n37. Regarding William Steven Banda, the judgement of Justice Kakusa in the High Court is instructive. The\njudge found that there was no evidence, on a balance of probabilities, to prove that Banda was born in\nZambia of Zambian parents. He found that Banda was an unreliable witness. He, however, refused to rule\nas to where Banda originated from. He dismissed all evidence that suggested that Banda was from Malawi,\nas inadmissible and hearsay. He also noted that the government had failed to produce the alleged\nMalawian father of Banda. The judge also made the following obiter dictum without justifying his opinion,\nthat \"once it is shown on a balance of probabilities that a petitioner is not a citizen of this Republic he\nbecomes a deportable person even if the country to which he must proceed is unknown ... possession of a\nNational Registration Card ... does not confer citizenship...\" (at p J25). It appears that the authorities relied\non this statement in deporting William Steven Banda.\n38. The judge also expressed himself in sympathy with Banda's predicament. He said \"the petitioner has\nbeen in Zambia for a long time and has, in his own way, contributed in the political arena ... Zambia has\nbecome almost the petitioner's only home - a de facto situation - upon which the executive may exercise its\ndiscretion and, maybe, consider normalising the status of petitioner should he apply... If this court were\nempowered to declare persons like petitioner be Zambians, the petitioner would have received a favourable\ndeclaration considering his long stay in Zambia and the role he played\" (J25).\n39. It is not denied that on the day of the judgement, William Steven Banda was taken into custody and\ndeported to Malawi. In addition, Banda charges that his pleas that he be taken to South Africa were ignored\nincluding his request for a five-days stay of execution of the warrant.\n40. It is evident that the Malawi Courts are irrelevant for purposes of deciding this matter against Zambia.\nThe fact that they declared Complainants not to be Malawi citizens is neither here nor there. Secondly, the\nCommission is not competent to substitute the judgements of the Zambian courts, especially on matters of\nfact. It must be accepted that the legal processes were appropriate and conducted in a manner that\n3\n\n\fshowed respect for the rule of law. The legal processes in Zambia did not violate the principles of the\nCharter. The Commission must, therefore, accept that William Steven Banda was not a Zambian by birth or\ndescent.\n41. This does not mean, however, that the Commission should not raise questions of law especially as the\nZambian courts did not consider the obligations of Zambia under the African Charter. The court also failed\nto rule on the alleged reason for the deportation, namely, that his presence was likely \"to endanger peace\nand good order in Zambia...\". There was no judicial inquiry on the basis in law and in terms of\nadministrative justice for relying on this \"opinion\" of the Minister of Home Affairs for the action taken. The\nfact that Banda was not a Zambian by itself, does not justify his deportation. It must be proved that his\npresence in Zambia was in violation of the laws. To the extent that neither Banda nor Chinula were\nsupplied with reasons for the action taken against them means that the right to receive information was\ndenied to them (Article 9(1)).\n42. The Rapporteur invited the parties to give guidance on the authority of the Charter where it was in\ncontradiction to domestic law. That seems relevant because Zambia ratified the Charter by Executive Act.\nThat means that there is legislative process that domesticates international human rights treaties. Mr\nMulonda affirmed Zambia's commitment to abide by the treaties it is party to. He also confirmed that\nZambia operated a dual legal system and that the Charter is not considered to be a self executing\nmeasure. Nonetheless, Zambia accepted the binding character of the Charter in Zambia.\n43. By all accounts, though, Banda was in possession of Zambian national registration certificate and a\npassport. For many years he freely used these without challenge. Immediately following the verdict of the\nSupreme Court, he voluntarily presented himself to the police but he was forcibly deported. This meant that\nhe was denied the opportunity to pursue the option of applying for citizenship by naturalisation in terms of\nthe Citizenship Act. Granted, the government argues that Banda had obtained the documents of\nregistration and Passport by making false claims about his place of birth. He could not therefore, be\napproaching the court with clean hands. The unstated implication being that the chances of his obtaining\nnaturalisation were negligible. In truth, of course, the Court did not say that Banda was an illegal immigrant.\nIt simply disputed his claims to being Zambian by birth. It was not proved, therefore, that Banda was in\nZambia illegally. It was not proved, therefore, that Banda was in Zambia illegally.\n44. Zambia has contravened Article 7 of the Charter in that he was not allowed to pursue the administrative\nmeasures, which were opened to him in terms of the Citizenship Act. More importantly, Zambia is in breach\nof Article 7(2) which says that \"no one may be condemned for an act or omission which did not constitute a\nlegally punishable offence at the time it was committed...\" By all accounts, Banda's residence and status in\nZambia had been accepted. He had made a contribution to the politics of the country. The provisions of\nArticle 12(4) have been violated.\n45. The allegations of violations of Articles 2, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10 may now be addressed. The evidence that\nWilliam Steven Banda was a political opponent of the ruling MMD cannot be lost sight of. The manner in\nwhich he was treated was demeaning of the dignity and status of somebody of his standing in society. It\nappears that he was singled out for action because of his ethnic origin, which incidentally, is also found in\nZambia. The authorities insisted on deporting him to Malawi even though, he told them that he knew\nnobody there. There was no compelling evidence that he had roots in Malawi having lived in Zambia, by\ntheir own admission, since about 1964. Counsel for Zambia argued that Banda was \"accepted\" by the\nMalawi immigration authorities. Whatever may have been the \"legal\" basis for such \"acceptance\", Malawi\ncourts have ruled that they were not citizens of Malawi. In addition, unlawful deportation could not be said\nto obliterate their rights in Zambia.\n46. John Lyson Chinula was in an even worse predicament. He was not given any opportunity to contest\nthe deportation order. Surely, government cannot say that Chinula had gone underground in 1974 having\noverstayed his visiting permit. Chinula, by all account, was a prominent businessman and politician. If\ngovernment wished to act against him they could have done so. That they did not, does not justify the\narbitrary nature of the arrest and deportation on 31st August 1994. He was entitled to have his case heard\nin the Courts of Zambia. Zambia has violated Article 7 of the Charter. Having made that finding, the findings\nin para. 30 above also obtain in this circumstance.\n47. The Commission had requested provisional measures in terms of Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure.\nZambia must be required to allow the return of William Steven Banda with a view to making application for\ncitizenship by naturalisation. No evidence was led before the Commission for compensation. The evidence\nis that Banda had lost his job as governor after the 1991 elections. No award for compensation is called for.\n\n4\n\n\f48. John Lyson Chinula died in Malawi. He was a prominent businessman. His deportation must have\ncaused prejudice to his business interests. His family is requesting the return of his body for burial in\nZambia. The Government of Zambia should be required to grant that wish.\n49. The Government of Zambia has relied on the \"claw-back\" clause of Article 12(2):\nThis right may only be subject to restrictions, provided for by law for the protection of national security, law\nor order, public health or morality...\n50. The deportation order also stated that the deportees were considered \" a danger to peace and good\norder to Zambia\". The Commission is of the view that the \"claw-back\" clauses must not be interpreted\nagainst the principles of the Charter. Recourse to these should not be used as a means of giving credence\nto violations of the express provisions of the Charter. Secondly, the rules of natural justice must apply.\nAmong these are in the audi alterm partem rule, the right to be heard, the right of access to the Court. The\nCourt in Zambia, in Banda's case failed to examine the basis of administrative action and as such, it has\nnot been proved that the deportees were indeed a danger to law and order. In any event the suggestion\nthat they were \"likely\" to be a danger was vague and not proved. It is important for the Commission to\ncaution against a too easy resort to the limitation clauses in the African Charter. The onus is on the state to\nprove that it is justified to resort to the limitation clause. The Commission should act bearing in mind the\nprovisions of Articles 61 and 62 of the Charter.\n51. Article 2 of the Charter reads:\nEvery individual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognised and guaranteed in\nthe present Charter without distinction of any kind such as race, ethnic group, colour, sex, language,\nreligion political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or other status.\n52. By forcibly expelling the two victims from Zambia, the State has violated their right to enjoyment of all\nthe rights enshrined in the African Charter. This article imposes an obligation on the Zambian Government\nto secure the rights protected in the African Charter to all persons within their jurisdiction irrespective of\npolitical or any other opinion. This obligation was reaffirmed by the Commission in Rencontre africaine pour\nla défense des droits de l'Homme / Zambia (Communication 71/92). The arbitrary removal of one's\ncitizenship in the case of Chinula cannot be justified.\n53. Article 9(2) states:\nEvery individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinions within the law.\n54. Both Banda and Chinula were leading politicians and businessmen. Both had lived in Zambia for\ndecades. Even if deportation action had been initiated against them in 1974 and 1976, it can be safely\nassumed that the action had been advanced unless it is proved that that was due to unlawfulness, fraud or\nobstruction of the course of justice. None of this was alleged. Action was accelerated upon the assumption\nof office of MMD government in 1991, we are therefore persuaded that the deportations were politically\nmotivated. This provision of the Charter reflects the fact that freedom of expression is a fundamental\nhuman right, essential to an individual personal development, political consciousness and participation in\nthe public affairs of his country. The Commission has to determine whether the \"deportations\", being\npolitically, motivated violate the provisions of Article 9(2) of the African Charter as the two victims were\ndenied the right to freedom of conscience as stipulated in Article 8 of the Charter.\n55. Article 8 of the African Charter states:\nFreedom of conscience, the profession and free practice of religion shall be guaranteed.\nNo one may, subject to law and order, be submitted to measures restricting the exercise of these freedoms.\n56. Article 10 of the Charter, which states:\nEvery individual shall have the right to the free association provided that he abides by the law.\n57. In deporting the two men, the government of Zambia has denied them the exercise of their right to\nfreedom of association. This is so since they have been prevented from associating with their colleagues in\nthe United National Independence Party and participating in their activities.\n58. As the African Commission ruled in the case of John K. Modise/ Botswana, by forcing Banda and\nChinula to live as stateless persons under degrading conditions, the government of Zambia has deprived\nthem of their family and is depriving their families of the men's support, and this constitutes a violation of\nthe dignity of a human being. Thereby violating Article 5 of the Charter, which guarantees the right to:\n5\n\n\fthe respect of the dignity inherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status.\n59. The forcible expulsion of Banda and Chinula by the Zambian government has forcibly broken up the\nfamily unit which is the core of society thereby failing in its duties to protect and assist the family as\nstipulated in Articles 18(1) and 18(2) of the Charter:\n\"The family shall be the natural unit and basic of society. It shall be protected by the State...\" \"The State\nshall have the duty to assist the family which is the custodian of morals and traditional values recognised by\nthe community.\"\n60. Article 7(1)(a) states that:\nEvery individual shall have the right to have his cause heard... ...(a) \"the right to an appeal to competent\nnational organs against acts of violating his fundamental rights as recognised and guaranteed ...\n61. The Zambia government by denying Mr Chinula the opportunity to appeal his deportation order has\ndeprived him of a right to fair hearing which contravenes all Zambian domestic laws and international\nhuman rights laws.\n\nHolding\n\nFor these reasons, the Commission\nHolds a violation of Articles 2, 7(1)(a), 8, 9(2), 10, 18(1) and 18(2) of the Charter.\nBujumbura, 5th May 1999.\n\n6\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"49","date":"May 5, 1999","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"Freedom of opinion, Torture and ill treatment, Right to fair trial, Freedom of expression, Freedom of association, Freedom of movement, Corruption and fraud","activity_report":"12th Activity Report: 1998 – 1999","outcome":"4"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080bcd3e","title":"Law Offices of Ghazi Suleiman  Sudan","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559265799,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"220_98 Law Offices of Ghazi Suleiman _ Sudan.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463559266887lh7wkexvl13mobt9.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463559266887lh7wkexvl13mobt9.pdf","size":14850},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"220/98 Law Offices of Ghazi Suleiman / Sudan\nSummary of Facts\n1. [The] Complainant is a Human Rights Law office in Sudan and is submitting the communication on\nbehalf of all university students and teachers in Sudan.\n2. The complaint was sent by post and received at the Secretariat on 14th October 1998.\n3. [The] Complainant alleges that on 26th September the Minister of Education in Sudan announced that all\nthe universities in Sudan would be closed for one month.\n4. It is alleged that the closure of universities is in order to assist the military mobilisation for the civil war in\nSouthern Sudan.\n5. The Complainant has included with the complaint, a sworn affidavit by a university lecturer in the\nKhartoum University to attest to these allegations.\n6. [The] Complainant notifies the [African] Commission that though an administrative appeal has been filed\nagainst the decision of the Minister of Education, he does not believe this will yield any realistic success.\n7. The Complainant urges the [African] Commission to adopt provisional measures under Rule 111 of its\nRules of Procedure which will request the government of Sudan to re-open the universities immediately and\nprevent further interference with university teaching.\n\nComplaint\n8. The Complainant alleges a violation of Articles 6, 7(c) and 17(1) of the African Charter.\n\nProcedure\n9. At the 24th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 22nd to 31st October 1998, the [African]\nCommission decided to be seized of the communication.\n10. On 26th November 1990, the Secretariat informed the two parties of the [African] Commission's\ndecision.\n11. On 3rd May 1999, during the 25th Ordinary Session of the [African] Commission in Bujumbura, Burundi,\na representative of the government of Sudan submitted a written response to the [African] Commission\nconcerning the communication.\n12. At its 25th Ordinary Session held in Bujumbura, Burundi, the [African] Commission postponed\nconsideration of the communication to the next session.\n13. On 13th May 1999, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission wrote letters to all the parties notifying\nthem of this decision.\n14. On 21st September 1999, the Complainant notified the Secretariat of the [African] Commission of a new\naddress for all correspondences relating to the communication.\n15. During the 26th Ordinary Session, the [African] Commission received a written response, together with a\nthree paged document in Arabic, from Dr Ahmed El Mufti, Rapporteur of the Advisory Council for Human\nRights, Ministry of Justice, Sudan concerning the communication. The attached document is said to be the\ndecision of the Constitutional Division of the High Court.\n16. The [African] Commission considered the communication at its 26th Ordinary Session held in Kigali,\nRwanda and requested the Complainant to submit written observations on the outcome of the\nadministrative appeal filed against the decision of the Minister of Education, and generally, on the\nadministrative appeal processes in the Republic of Sudan.\n17. On 21st January 2000, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission wrote to the parties informing them\nof the decision of the [African] Commission. It specifically requested the government of Sudan to furnish it\nwith the translation of the decision of the Constitutional Division of the High Court in English or French.\n18. On 23rd February 2000, following an email from Dr Curtis Doebbler of the Complainant Firm requesting\nthe Secretariat to furnish him on the progress of all communications filed, the Secretariat forwarded to him\nthrough email the letter of 21st January 2000. It also requested him to indicate a fax number to enable it\nsend observations received from the government of Sudan for his response.\n19. On 1st March 2000, the Secretariat received an email from Dr Curtis Doebbler indicating a fax number\nfor the above documents to be sent. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the same and intimated to\n1\n\n\fhim the necessity of submitting the requested written responses on time.\n20. On 8th March 2000, the observation of the government of Sudan was faxed to the Complainant in the\nUS as requested.\n21. The Complainant repeated its request for information on the progress of all communications pending\nbefore the [African] Commission on 9th and 16th March 2000.\n22. At last, the Secretariat received an e-mail from Dr Curtis Doebbler on 17th March 2000, acknowledging\nreceipt of the e-mail indicating the facts of all the pending communications filed by the Complainant, and\nalso promising to furnish it with their responses no later than 24th March 2000.\n23. At the 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria, the [African] Commission heard oral submissions from\nparties and decided to consolidate all the cases. It requested to furnish it with written submissions on the\nissue of exhaustion of local remedies.\n24. On 30th June 2000, the above decisions were communicated to parties.\n25. On 4th September 2000, Dr Curtis Doebbler wrote from Cairo to the Secretariat of the [African]\nCommission requesting information on the decision taken by the [African] Commission at the 27th Session\nin Algiers.\n26. The Secretariat responded on 7th September 2000, informing him that same had earlier been faxed to\nhim and observing that there were at least three e-mail addresses given by him to the Secretariat for\ncommunication purposes and proposing that he should indicate the most suitable e-mail address for future\ncorrespondence in order to avoid delays and missing mails. The mails were dispatched to though all the\ne-mail addresses designated by him and also through fax.\n27. On 14th September 2000, Dr Curtis Doebbler acknowledged receipt of the mails but pleaded for an\nadjournment to enable him submit in advance a full brief on the issue of exhaustion of local remedies and\nto arrange for his witnesses.\n28. On 13th March 2001, the Secretariat received the Complainant's submission. At the 29th Ordinary\nSession, the [African] Commission will hear evidence on exhaustion of local remedies and will then decide\non admissibility.\n29. At the 29th Ordinary session held in Tripoli, the Rapporteur introduced the communications and\nreviewed the facts and the status of the case. The [African] Commission thereafter heard the parties to the\ncase. Following detailed discussions, the [African] Commission noted that the Complainant had submitted a\ndetailed brief on the case. It was therefore recommended that consideration of this communication be\ndeferred to the 30th Session pending submission of detailed replies by the Respondent State.\n30. On 19th June 2001, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties of the above\ndecision and requested the Respondent State to forward its written submissions within two (2) months from\nthe date of notification of the decision.\n31. On 14th August 2001, a reminder was sent to the Respondent State to forward its submissions within\nthe prescribed time to enable the Secretariat proceed with the communication.\n32. During the 30th Session, the Rapporteurs introduced the communications and reviewed the facts and\nthe status of each case. The [African] Commission thereafter heard the oral submission of the Respondent\nState to the case. Following detailed discussions, the [African] Commission noted that the Respondent\nState did not respond to the questions raised by the Complainant. The [African] Commission also heard\noral submissions by Dr Curtis Doebbler and recommended that consideration of these communications be\ndeferred to the 31st Session, pending detailed written submission by the Respondent State to the\nsubmissions of the Complainant.\n33. On 15th November 2002, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties on the decision\nof the [African] Commission and requested Respondent State to forward its written submissions within two\n(2) months from the date of notification of this decision.\n34. On 7th March 2002 [sic], a reminder was sent to the Respondent State to forward its submissions within\nthe prescribed time to enable the Secretariat to proceed with the communication.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n35. Article 56(5) of the African Charter provides: \"The communications stipulated in Article 55 received by\nthe Commission relating to human and peoples' rights, must meet the following conditions in order to be\ninvestigated:\n2\n\n\f(5) Be subsequent to exhausting all local remedies, if they exist, unless it is obvious to the Commission that\nthe procedure for such recourse is abnormally prolonged;\"\n36. Concerning the question of exhausting local avenues of recourse, the Complainant informed the\n[African] Commission that no effective recourse was available and that, even if used, the Constitutional\nCourt is not qualified due to the state of emergency and the political limitations, which makes it impossible\nto legitimately complain to the court.\n37. He maintains that the grounds for a local remedy that could apply are rendered ineffective by the fact\nthat the legal system in Sudan is neither free nor independent since the Sudanese courts have been\ncontrolled by the executive since 1998 and that, given this situation, the executive could not rule on\nproceedings brought against the Sudanese government which are based on international humanitarian law,\nor even apply this law when it is clearly relevant.\n38. The Complainant alleges that, in practice, the procedures in place, which allow for compensation for\nhuman rights violations committed by the Government of Sudan, are often inaccessible to those individuals\nwhose rights have been violated, due to the fact that current administrative and legal solutions are serious\nobstacles to their use. Consequently, complainants who ask that their rights be protected before Sudanese\ncourts, come up against obstacles which make these avenues of redress ineffective.\n39. The Sudanese government alleges that the complainants did not use the remedies available to them in\nthe local courts before applying to the [African] Commission. It insists that neither the lawyer lodging the\ncomplaint, nor the complainants, filed an appeal against the decision; this is proved from the registers of\nthe administrative courts.\n40. The government maintains that the Complainants, despite their insistence in previous correspondence,\ndid not transmit to them the reference number of the appeal that had been filed which proves that no\nappeal was filed, contrary to the assertions of the Complainants who therefore did not exhaust all the local\nremedies as provided in Article 56 of the African Charter.\n41. It argues that the right of the Complainants to file an appeal against a decision of the court, is provided\nfor in Article 20(1) of the Administrative and Constitutional Code of Justice of 1996 as amended in 2000,\nand documentation on decisions handed down in similar cases was submitted.\n42. Article 56(5) of the African Charter requires that \"a communication be introduced subsequent to\nexhaustion of local remedies, if they exist, unless it is obvious to the Commission that the procedure for\nsuch recourse is abnormally prolonged\". The complaint before the [African] Commission was received by\nthe Secretariat on 14th[[/sup]] October 1998 and the decision to close the universities was taken on 26th September 1998, an interval of one\nmonth between closure of the universities and receipt of the complaint.\n\n43. The [African] Commission is of the view that an interval of one month is a short time within which the\nComplainant could have accessed and exhausted all local remedies. Furthermore, the Complainant gives\nno indication of instituting proceedings before the domestic courts.\n\nHolding\n\nFor these reasons, and in accordance with Article 56(5) of the African Charter, the [African]\nCommission declares this communication inadmissible due to non-exhaustion of local remedies.\n\nDone at the 31st Ordinary session held in Pretoria, South Africa from 2nd May to 16th May 2002.\n\n3\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"44","date":"May 16, 2002","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"Right to fair trial, Arrest and detention, Right to education","activity_report":"15th Activity Report : 2001 - 2002","outcome":"19"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080bdcbb","title":"Democratic Republic of Congo  Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559265801,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"227_99 Democratic Republic of Congo _ Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"146355926699225n27pfvudhadcxr.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/146355926699225n27pfvudhadcxr.pdf","size":68955},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"227/99 Democratic Republic of Congo / Burundi,\nRwanda, Uganda\n\nSummary of Facts\n1. On 8th March 1999, the Secretariat of the African Commission received from Mr Léonard She Okitundu,\nMinister of Human Rights of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a letter with Reference No\nCABMIN/MDH/MM/201/MZ/99, dated 24th February 1999, a communication presented on behalf of the\nCongolese government based on the provisions of Article 49 of the Charter.\n2. The communication is filed against the Republics of Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda (hereinafter referred\nto, respectively, as 'Burundi', 'Rwanda' and 'Uganda'). It alleges grave and massive violations of human and\npeoples' rights committed by the armed forces of these three countries in the Congolese provinces where\nthere have been rebel activities since 2nd August 1998, and for which the Democratic Republic of Congo\nblames Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda. In support of its complaint the Democratic Republic of Congo states\nthat the Ugandan and Rwandan governments have acknowledged the presence of their respective armed\nforces in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo under what it terms the 'fallacious\npretext' of 'safeguarding their interests'. The complaint states, furthermore, that the Congolese government\nhas 'sufficient and overwhelming evidence of Burundi's involvement'.\n3. In particular, the Democratic Republic of Congo asserts that on Monday, 3rd August 1998, thirty-eight\n(38) officers and about [one hundred] (100) men of the Congolese forces were assassinated, after being\ndisarmed, at Kavumu airport, Bukavu, in the Congolese province of South Kivu. Relatedly, on Tuesday, 4th\nAugust 1998, over fifty (50) corpses were buried in Bukavu, about twenty (20) of them near the fuel station\nat the Nyamwera market, opposite Ibanda mosque. Other corpses (mostly civilians) were found at the\nmilitary camp called 'Sa?o camp' in Bukavu. On 17th August 1998, the Rwandan and Ugandan forces who\nhad been on Congolese territory for many weeks, besieged Inga hydroelectric dam, in Lower Congo\nprovince, a wholly civilian facility. The presence of these forces disrupted the lives of millions of people and\nthe economic life of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It also caused the death of many patients including\nchildren in hospitals, due to the cutting off of electricity supply to incubated operating theatres and other\nrespiratory equipment.\n4. On Monday, 24th August 1998, over eight hundred and fifty-six (856) persons were massacred in Kasika,\nin Lwindi chiefdom, and Mwenga. The bodies found over a distance of sixty kilometres (60 km) from\nKilungutwe to Kasika (in South Kivu province) were mainly those of women and children. The women had\nbeen raped before being killed by their murderers, who slashed them open from the vagina up to the\nabdomen and cut them up with daggers. On 2nd September 1998, in a bid to ambush the men of the\nCongolese army based in Kamituga, the Rwandan and Ugandan forces in Kitutu village massacred thirteen\n(13) people. On 6th October 1998, forty-eight (48) civilians were killed in Lubarika village. In Uvira town, on\nthe banks of Lake Tanganyika, a massacre of the population including intellectuals and other able-bodied\npersons took place. This was partly evidenced by the discovery of three hundred and twenty-six (326)\nbodies in Rushima river, near Luberizi. Five hundred and forty-seven (547) bodies were also discovered\nburied in a mass grave at Bwegera, and one hundred and thirty-eight (138) others were found in a\nbutcher's shop in Luvingi village. From 30th December 1998 to 1st January 1999, six hundred and twelve\n(612) persons were massacred in Makobola, South Kivu province. All these atrocities were committed by\nthe Rwandan and Ugandan forces which invaded territories of the Democratic Republic of Congo,\naccording to the complaint of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n5. The Democratic Republic of Congo also claims that the forces of Rwanda and Uganda aimed at\nspreading sexually transmitted diseases and committing rape. To this end, about two thousand (2000)\nAIDS suffering or HIV-positive Ugandan soldiers were sent to the front in the eastern province of Congo\nwith the mission of raping girls and women so as to propagate an AIDS pandemic among the local\npopulation and, thereby, decimate it. The Democratic Republic of Congo notes that 75% of the Ugandan\narmy are suffering from AIDS. A white paper annexed to the communication enumerates many cases of\n1\n\n\frape of girls and women perpetrated by the forces of Rwanda and Uganda, particularly in South Kivu\nprovince. It further states that on Monday, 5th October 1998, in Lumunba quarter, Babozo division, Bagira\ncommune, under the instructions of a young Rwandan officer nicknamed 'terminator', who was then\ncommanding the Bagira military camp, several young Congolese girls were raped by soldiers based at the\nsaid camp. Similar cases of rape have been reported from Mwenga, Walungu, Shabunda and Idjwi.\n6. The Democratic Republic of Congo avers that since the beginning of the war in its eastern provinces, the\ncivilian population has been deported by the Rwandan and Ugandan armies to what it refers to as\n'concentration camps' situated in Rwanda. It further states that other people are simply massacred and\nincinerated in crematories (especially in Bugusera, Rwanda). The goal of these operations is to make the\nindigenous people disappear from these regions and thus, to establish what it terms 'Tutsiland'.\n7. The Democratic Republic of Congo also accuses Rwanda and Uganda of carrying out systematic looting\nof the underground riches of the regions controlled by their forces, just as the possessions of the civilian\npopulation are being hauled away to Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. To substantiate its accusations, it\nstates that on 4th September 1998, the contents of all the safes of the local branch of the Central Bank of\nCongo in Bukavu town were looted and the booty taken away to Rwanda. In Kalema, a town in Maniema\nprovince, all the minerals in the factory of the SOMINKI firm were looted by the same forces. The\nDemocratic Republic of Congo claims that between October and December 1998, the gold produced by the\nOKIMO firm and by local diggers, yielding $100,000,000 (one hundred million US dollars) was carted to\nRwanda. Still according to its estimation, the coffee produced in the region and in North Kivu yielded about\n$70,000,000 (seventy million US dollars) to Uganda in the same period. As for the wood produced by the\nAMEXBOIS firm based in Kisangani town, it is exported to Uganda. Rwanda and Uganda have also taken\nover control of the fiscal and customs revenue collected respectively by the Directorate General of Taxes.\nThe plunder of the riches of the eastern provinces of Congo is also affecting endangered animal species\nsuch as okapis, mountain gorillas, rhinoceros, and elephants.\n\nComplaint\n8. The Democratic Republic of Congo claims, among other things, that it is the victim of an armed\naggression perpetrated by Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda; and that this is a violation of the fundamental\nprinciples that govern friendly relations between States, as stipulated in the Charters of the United Nations\n(UN) and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU); in particular, the principles of non-recourse to force in\ninternational relations, the peaceful settlement of differences, respect for the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of States and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. It emphasises that the massacres\nand other violations of human and peoples' rights that it accuses Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda of, are\ncommitted in violation of the provisions of Articles 2, 4, 6, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the African\nCharter.\n9. It also claims violation of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the\nGeneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and of the Additional Protocol on the Protection of Victims of\nInternational Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) of 8th June 1977.\n10. From the foregoing, the Democratic Republic of Congo, based on the facts presented and the law cited,\nrequests the [African] Commission to:\n1. Declare that [t]he violations of the human rights of the civilian population of the eastern provinces of\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo by Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi are in contravention of the\nrelevant provisions of the African Charter cited above; and\n2. Examine the communication diligently, especially in the light of Article 58(1)&Article 58(3) of the\nCharter with a view to producing a detailed, objective and impartial report on the grave and massive\nviolations of human rights committed in the war-affected eastern provinces and to submit it to the\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU.\n11. The Democratic Republic of Congo also requests the [African] Commission to:\n1. \"... Take due note of the violations of the relevant provisions of the Charters of the [UN], the [OAU],\nand the one on Human and Peoples' Rights;\n2. Condemn the aggression against the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has generated grave\nviolations of the human rights of peaceful peoples;\n2\n\n\f3. Deploy an investigation mission with a view to observing in loco the accusations made against\nBurundi, Rwanda and Uganda;\n4. Demand the unconditional withdrawal of the invading troops from Congolese territory in order to put\nan end to the grave and massive violations of human rights;\n5. Demand that the countries violating human and peoples' rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo\npay just reparation for the damages caused and the acts of looting; and\n6. Indicate the appropriate measures to punish the authors of the war crimes or crimes against\nhumanity, as the case may be, and the creation of an ad hoc tribunal to try the crimes committed\nagainst the Democratic Republic of Congo. The ad hoc tribunal may be created in collaboration with\nthe [UN]\".\n\nProcedure\n12. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the [African] Commission on 8th March 1999.\nThe same day, two letters were dispatched by fax, to the Ministry of Human Rights and the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Congo respectively, acknowledging receipt.\n13. In compliance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and the Rules of Procedure, the Secretariat\nthen submitted the communication to the [African] Commission, meeting at its 25th Ordinary Session from\n26th April to 5th May 1999, in Bujumbura (Burundi).\n14. At its 25th Ordinary session held in Bujumbura, Burundi, the [African] Commission took a decision of\nseizure on the communication and requested the Complainant State to forward an official copy of its\ncomplaint to the Secretary-General of the OAU.\n15. On 28th May 1999, Notes Verbale together with a copy of the communication were each sent to the\nMinistries of External Affairs/External Relations of the Respondent States informing them of the\ncommunication filed against them by the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n16. On 2nd June 1999, the Secretariat wrote to the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo\ninforming them of the decision of seizure taken by the [African] Commission and requesting them to comply\nwith the provisions of Article 49 of the Charter.\n17. At the 26th Session of the [African] Commission held in Kigali, Rwanda, the communication was not\nexamined, as the [African] Commission considered it necessary to allow the Respondent States more time\nto communicate their reactions.\n18. On 14th December 1999, the Secretariat wrote to the various parties requesting their reactions\nregarding the issue of admissibility.\n19. At the 27th Ordinary Session held from 27th April to 11th May 2000 in Algiers, Algeria, the [African]\nCommission heard oral submissions on the admissibility of the case from representatives of the\nComplainant State and from two Respondent States (Rwanda and Uganda). The [African] Commission,\nafter examining the case according to the provisions of its Rules of Procedures, thereafter declared the\ncommunication admissible and requested parties to furnish it with arguments on the merits of the case.\n20. The parties were accordingly informed of the above decision on 14th July 2000.\n21. At the 28th Session of the [African] Commission held from 23rd October to 6th November 2000 in\nCotonou, Benin, the communication was not considered as the [African] Commission had not received any\nresponse from Respondent States on the request that was extended to them following the 27th Session.\n22. During the Session, however, the delegation of Rwanda transmitted to the Secretariat of the [African]\nCommission, a submission, which stated that the [African] Commission should not have declared\ncommunication 227/99 admissible because the procedure followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo\nwas not valid and that the [African] Commission itself had not respected the provisions of its own Rules of\nProcedure. The submission further stated that the matters addressed by the communication were pending\nbefore competent authorities of the Organisation of African Unity and other international bodies like the UN\nSecurity Council and ECOSOC. Finally, Rwanda refuted allegations of human rights violations made\nagainst it by the Democratic Republic of Congo and justified the presence of its troops in this country on\ngrounds of security, while accusing the Democratic Republic of Congo of hosting groups hostile to Rwanda.\n23. The submission of Rwanda was transmitted to all States concerned with communication 227/99.\n24. In October 2000, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission received from Uganda a submission on\ncommunication 227/99 in which the Respondent State recognised and justified the presence of its troops in\n3\n\n\fthe Democratic Republic of Congo. The troops were said to be in the Democratic Republic of Congo to\nprevent Ugandan rebels from attacking the Ugandan territory.\n25. Uganda stated in its submission that since the early 1990s the territory of the Democratic Republic of\nCongo (then the Republic of Zaire) has provided sanctuary to bands of armed rebel groups. These rebel\ngroups, which Uganda claims support former dictator Idi Amin, have posed a significant danger for Uganda\nsince 1996.\n26. Uganda stated that supported by both Sudan and Mobutu's government in the Democratic Republic of\nCongo, these groups grew to 6,000, posing a serious security threat to Uganda and that therefore Ugandan\ntroops were present in the Democratic Republic of Congo in order to prevent Ugandan rebels from\nattacking the Ugandan territory.\n27. The submission further states that after Mobutu's overthrow in 1997, the Kabila government invited\nUganda to enter eastern Congo to work together to stop the activities of the anti-Uganda rebels and that\nUgandan armed forces remained in the Democratic Republic of Congo at the request of President Kabila\nsince his forces 'had no capability to exercise authority' in the remote eastern region. Uganda attached the\nProtocol between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Uganda on Security along the\nCommon Border to show that both sides recognised the problem of armed groups and decided to\ncooperate.\n28. According to Uganda, President Kabila revoked the above-mentioned agreement in August 1998 as a\nnew rebellion started in the Democratic Republic of Congo (when the coalition that had overthrown Mobutu\ndisintegrated) and blamed this 'internal rebellion', on the invasion of Uganda and Rwanda. The Democratic\nRepublic of Congo then started looking for allies in its struggle against the rebels and it turned to forces\nhostile to the governments of Rwanda and Uganda, specifically the Allied Democratic Force and pro-Idi\nAmin groups. Uganda said it therefore had no option but to keep its troops in the Democratic Republic of\nCongo, in order to deal with the threat of attacks posed by these foreign-sponsored rebel groups.\n29. To support its actions, Uganda cited provisions of international instruments:\n1. Article 51\n× Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence\nif an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has\ntaken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by\nMembers in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security\nCouncil and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under\nthe present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or\nrestore international peace and security.\nof the UN Charter;\n2. Article 3\n× Calls upon all States to refrain from all acts of aggression and other uses of force contrary to the\nCharter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning\nFriendly Relations and Co-operation among States In accordance with the Charter of the United\nNations;\nof the UN General Assembly Resolution on the Definition of Aggression;\n3. The UN General Assembly Declaration of Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly\nRelations and Cooperation among States; and\n4. Article 23 of the African Charter.\n30. In its submission, Uganda also points to the lack of evidence implicating it in the alleged human rights\nviolations, stating for example that, Ugandan troops have never been in some places mentioned in the\ncommunication. The submission characterises the violations relating to HIV/AIDS as 'the most ridiculous\nallegation'. Referring to the joint case against itself, Rwanda, and Burundi, Uganda claims that '[t]here is\nnever group responsibility for violations.' In addition, \"allegations of human rights violations must be verified\nby an independent body or by a fact-finding Commission\". Uganda contrasts the allegations it faces with\nevidence of the Democratic Republic of Congo government's involvement in violations in its eastern\nprovinces.\n31. As for the withdrawal of Ugandan troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the submission relies\non the Democratic Republic of Congo's failed request to the [International Court of Justice] (ICJ) to order\nthe unconditional withdrawal of Ugandan troops.\n4\n\n\f32. Regarding payment of reparations, Uganda points to the lack of documentation on this issue and,\nconcerning the illegal exploitation of the Democratic Republic of Congo's natural resources, Uganda denied\ninvolvement and affirmed its \"unconditional support to the United Nation's efforts to set up a panel of\nexperts [that the Democratic Republic of Congo has also approved] to investigate\" the issue.\n33. On the issue of investigation of human rights violations, while Uganda welcomed the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo's call for independent investigation, it portrayed the Democratic Republic of Congo's\nuninvestigated allegations as 'disturbing'.\n34. Uganda also noted that the Democratic Republic of Congo has accused Uganda in several other fora:\nthe UN Security Council, the ICJ, the Lusaka Initiative, and the OAU. According to the Respondent State,\nthese actions \"present a dilemma to the conduct of international affairs...and adjudication,\" undermining the\ncredibility of these institutions and the [African] Commission as divergent opinions may be reached.\n35. In conclusion Uganda contends that \"there is no legal basis on which the African Commission can deal\nwith the communication and declare any of the remedies sought by the Democratic Republic of Congo\nagainst Uganda.\".\n36. Copies of the submissions of Uganda on communication 227/99 were transmitted to all States\nconcerned by the communication.\n37. In December 2000, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission received a set of five (5) submissions\nfrom the Democratic Republic of Congo containing reports on alleged violations of human rights by armed\nforces of the Respondent States and their alleged allies in the territory of the Democratic Republic of\nCongo. The submissions also stated that the foreign uninvited troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo\nwere looting the resources of the country.\n38. The Secretariat of the [African] Commission transmitted these submissions to the respective parties to\nthe communication.\n39. At the 29th Session, which was held from 23rd April to 7th May 2001 in Tripoli, Libya, the communication\nwas not considered because the [African] Commission had still not received any submission from one of\nthe Respondent State, namely, Burundi. On that occasion, all relevant letters and submissions by the other\nStates were transmitted to the delegations of all the Respondent States including Burundi, for their\nconsideration and reaction to the [African] Commission.\n40. In August 2001, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission received a request from the Ministry of\nHuman Rights of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which deplored the delays in the processing of\ncommunication 227/99 and invited the [African] Commission to summon an extraordinary session in order\nto deal diligently with the communication.\n41. By Notes Verbales ACHPR/COMM/044 sent to their respective Ministries of Foreign/External Affairs on\n26th September 2001, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission informed all States concerned by\ncommunication 227/99 that it was going to consider the said communication on the merits, at its 30th\nOrdinary Session scheduled from 13th to 27th October 2001 in Banjul, The Gambia.\n42. In October 2001, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission received a Note Verbale from Rwanda,\nwhich restated the objections raised in its submission of October 2000 concerning communication 227/99,\nadding that if Rwanda's arguments were not taken into account, it should not be called upon to present a\ndefence.\n43. At its 30th Session, the [African] Commission discussed the request by the Democratic Republic of\nCongo about organising an extraordinary session to deal with communication 227/99 and resolved to raise\nthe issue with the relevant authorities of the Secretariat of the African Union. The [African] Commission also\nheard oral statements by the delegations of Rwanda and Uganda on the issue, written copies of which\nwere also handed over to its Secretariat.\n44. In its statement, the Rwandan delegation reiterated its arguments stated during the 28th Session and\nobjected to the proposed extraordinary session to deal with the communication on the grounds that the\ncommunication could be considered during an ordinary session and that an extraordinary session will have\nfinancial implication[s]. Rwanda therefore recommended that the [African] Commission deals with the\ncommunication during its 31st Session scheduled for May 2002 in Pretoria, South Africa. The statement\nfurther justified the presence of Rwandan troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo by the assistance\nthat the Government of this country is granting elements hostile to the Government of Kigali and concluded\nthat as long as such a threat exists for Rwanda, it could not withdraw its troops from the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo.\n45. In its statement, the Ugandan delegation said that they had not received the documents sent to them on\ncommunication 227/99 and could not present their defence at that stage. The delegation further objected to\n5\n\n\fthe holding of an extraordinary session to deal with the communication and added that the facts\ncomplained of by the Democratic Republic of Congo are also pending before the ICJ and that consideration\nof the communication by the [African] Commission would prejudice the court hearing.\n46. At the 31st Session of the [African] Commission, which was held from 2nd to 16th May 2002 in Pretoria,\nSouth Africa, the [African] Commission did not consider the communication because there had been no\nresponse from the OAU regarding the request from the Democratic Republic of Congo on the holding of the\nextraordinary session on the communication. During that session, the [African] Commission resolved to\nproceed as follows: the African Commission would hold the extraordinary session in case the Secretariat\nGeneral of the OAU agree[d] to it, or (in case the OAU did not accept the idea of extraordinary session), the\nAfrican Commission would arrange its agenda for the 32nd Ordinary Session in such a way as to have\nsufficient time to deal with the communication. That decision was communicated to the delegations of all\nthe States concerned who were attending the session.\n47. By Note Verbale ACHPR/COMM 227/99 of 11 June 2002, the Secretariat transmitted that decision to\nthe States concerned by the communication.\n48. A reminder was also sent to the same States by Notes Verbale ACHPR/COMM 227/99 on 8th October\n2002.\n49. During its 32nd Ordinary Session which took place from 17 to 23 October 2002 in Banjul, the Gambia,\nthe [African] Commission did not consider this communication because of the circumstances of the\nsession1 which did not provide enough time to deal with this important communication.\n50. The [African] Commission took a decision on the merits of the communication during its 33rd Ordinary\nSession, which was held from 15th to 29th May 2003 in Niamey, Niger.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n51. The procedure for bringing inter-state communications before the [African] Commission is governed by\nArticles 47 to 49 of the Charter. At this stage, it is important to mention that this is the first inter-State\ncommunication brought before the African Commission.\n52. It is to be noted that Burundi2 , a Respondent State was provided with all the relevant submissions\nrelating to this communication, in conformity with Article 57 of the Charter. But neither did Burundi react to\nany of them nor did it make any oral submission before the [African] Commission regarding the complaint.\n53. The African Commission would like to emphasise that the absence of reaction from Burundi does not\nabsolve the latter from the decision the African Commission may arrive at in the consideration of the\ncommunication. Burundi by ratifying the African Charter indicated its commitment to cooperate with the\n[African] Commission and to abide by all decisions taken by the latter.\n54. In their oral arguments before the [African] Commission at its 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria (27th\nApril to 11th May 2000), Rwanda and Uganda had argued that the decision of the Complainant State to\nsubmit the communication directly to the Chairman of the [African] Commission without first notifying them\nand the Secretary General of the OAU, is procedurally wrong and therefore fatal to the admissibility of the\ncase.\n55. Article 47 requires the Complainant State to draw, by written communication, the attention of the\nviolating State to the matter and the communication should also be addressed to the Secretary General of\nthe OAU and the Chairman of the [African] Commission. The State to which the communication is\naddressed is to give written explanation or statement elucidating the matter within three months of the\nreceipt of the communication.\n56. By the provisions of Article 48 of the Charter, if within three months from the date on which the original\ncommunication is received by the State to which it is addressed, the issue is not settled to the satisfaction\nof the two States involved through bilateral negotiation or by any other peaceful procedure, either State\nshall have the right to submit the matter to the [African] Commission through the Chairman and to notify the\nother States involved.\n57. The provisions of Articles 47 and 48, read in conjunction with Rule 88 to Rule 92 of the Rules of\nProcedure of the [African] Commission are geared towards the achievement of one of the essential\nobjectives and fundamental principles of the Charter: conciliation.\n58. The [African] Commission is of the view that the procedure outlined in Article 48 of the Charter is\npermissive and not mandatory. This is borne out by the use of the word \"may\". Witness the first sentence of\n6\n\n\fthis provision: \"If a State Party to the Present Charter has good reasons to believe that another State Party\nto this Charter has violated the provisions of the Charter, it may draw, by written communication, the\nattention of that State to the matter\".\n59. Moreover, where the dispute is not settled amicably, Article 48 of the Charter requires either State to\nsubmit the matter to the [African] Commission through the Chairman and to notify the other States involved.\nIt does not, however, provide for its submission to the Secretary General of the OAU. Nevertheless, based\non the decision of the [African] Commission at its 25th Ordinary Session, requesting it to forward a copy of\nits complaint to the Secretary General of the OAU (see paragraph 14 above), the Complainant State had\ndone so.\n60. Furthermore, it appears that the main reason why the Charter makes provision for the Respondent\nState to be informed of such violations or notified of the submission of such a communication to the\n[African] Commission, is to avoid a situation of springing surprises on the States involved. This procedure\nenables the Respondent States to decide whether to settle the complaint amicably or not. The [African]\nCommission is of the view that even if the Complainant State had not abided by the said provision of the\nCharter, such omission is not fatal to the communication since after being seized of the case, a copy of the\ncommunication, as is the practice of the [African] Commission, was forwarded to the Respondent States for\ntheir observations (see paragraph 15 above).\n61. Article 49 on the other hand, provides for a procedure where the Complainant State directly seizes the\n[African] Commission without passing through the conciliation phase. Accordingly, the Complainant State\nmay refer the matter directly to the [African] Commission by addressing a communication to the Chairman,\nthe Secretary General of the OAU and the State concerned. Such a process allows the requesting State to\navoid making contacts with the Respondent State in cases where such contacts will not be diplomatically\neither effective or desirable. In the [African] Commission's considered opinion that seems to be the case\nhere. Indeed, the situation of undeclared war prevailing between the Democratic Republic of Congo and its\nneighbours to the east did not favour the type of diplomatic contact that would have facilitated the\napplication of the provisions of Articles 47 and 48 of the [African] Charter. It was also for this reason that\nthe [African] Commission took the view that Article 52 did not apply to this communication.\n62. The [African] Commission is mindful of the requirement that it can consider or deal with a matter\nbrought before it if the provisions of Article 50 of the Charter and 97(c) of the Rules of Procedure are met,\nthat is if all local remedies, if they exist, have been exhausted, unless such would be unduly prolonged.\n63. The [African] Commission takes note that the violations complained of are allegedly being perpetrated\nby the Respondent States in the territory of the Complainant State. In the circumstances, the [African]\nCommission finds that local remedies do not exist, and the question of their exhaustion does not, therefore,\narise.\n64. The effect of the alleged activities of the rebels and armed forces of the Respondent State Parties to\nthe Charter, which also back the rebels, fall not only within the province of humanitarian law, but also within\nthe mandate of the [African] Commission. The combined effect of Articles 60 and 61 of the [African] Charter\ncompels this conclusion; and it is also buttressed by Article 23 of the African Charter.\n65. There is also authority, which does not exclude violations committed during armed conflict from the\njurisdiction of the [African] Commission. In communication 74/92 Commission nationale des droits de\nl'Homme et des libertés, the [African] Commission held that the African Charter \"unlike other human rights\ninstruments, does not allow for States Parties to derogate from their treaty obligations during emergency\nsituations. Thus, even a situation of ....war...cannot be cited as justification by the State violating or\npermitting violations of the African Charter\" (see also 159/96 UIDH et al. / Angola).\nFrom the foregoing, the [African] Commission declares the communication admissible.\n\nMerits\n66. The use of armed force by the Respondent States, which the Democratic Republic of Congo complains\nof, contravenes the well-established principle of international law that States shall settle their disputes by\npeaceful means in such a manner that international peace, security and justice are not endangered.\nIndeed, there cannot be both national and international peace and security guaranteed by the African\nCharter under the conditions created by the Respondent States in the eastern provinces of the\n7\n\n\fComplainant State.\n67. Rwanda and Uganda, in their oral arguments before the [African] Commission at its 27th Ordinary\nSession held in Algeria had argued that the decision of the Complainant State to submit the communication\ndirectly to the Chairman of the [African] Commission without first notifying them and the Secretary General\nof the OAU, is procedurally wrong and therefore fatal to the admissibility of the case. But the African\nCommission found otherwise.\n68. The [African] Commission finds the conduct of the Respondent States inconsistent with the standard\nexpected of them under UN Declaration on Friendly Relations, which is implicitly affirmed by the Charters\nof the UN and OAU, and which the [African] Commission is mandated by Article 23 of the African Charter to\nuphold. Any doubt that this provision has been violated by the Respondent States is resolved by recalling\nan injunction in the UN Declaration on Friendly Relations: \"No State or group of States has the right to\nintervene directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever [sic], in the internal or external affairs of any other\nStates. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against\nthe personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements are in violation of\ninternational law...Also no State shall organise, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive,\nterrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State or interfere\nin civil strife in another State.\". The substance of the complaint of the Democratic Republic of Congo\nagainst the Respondents is covered by the foregoing prohibition. The Respondent States have therefore\nviolated Article 23 of the African Charter. The conduct of the Respondent States also constitutes a flagrant\nviolation of the right to the unquestionable and inalienable right of the peoples of the Democratic Republic\nof Congo to self-determination provided for by Article 20 of the African Charter, especially clause 1 of this\nprovision.\n69. The Complainant State alleges grave and massive violations of human and peoples' rights committed\nby the armed forces of the Respondent States in its eastern provinces. It details series of massacres,\nrapes, mutilations, mass transfers of populations and looting of the peoples' possessions, as some of those\nviolations. As noted earlier on, the series of violations alleged to have been committed by the armed forces\nof the Respondent States fall within the province of humanitarian law, and therefore rightly covered by the\nFour Geneva Conventions and the Protocols additional to them. And the [African] Commission having\nfound the alleged occupation of parts of the provinces of the Complainant State by the Respondents to be\nin violation of the Charter cannot turn a blind eye to the series of human rights violations attendant upon\nsuch occupation.\n70. The combined effect of Articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter enables the [African] Commission to\ndraw inspiration from international law on human and peoples' rights, the Charter of the UN, the Charter of\nthe OAU and also to take into consideration, as subsidiary measures to determine the principles of law,\nother general or special international conventions, laying down rules recognized by Member States of the\nOAU, general principles recognised by African States as well as legal precedents and doctrine. By virtue of\nArticles 60 and 61, the [African] Commission holds that the Four Geneva Conventions and the two\nAdditional Protocols covering armed conflicts constitute part of the general principles of law recognised by\nAfrican States, and take [the] same into consideration in the determination of this case.\n71. It is noted that Article 75(2)\n× Art 75. Fundamental guarantees 2. The following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in\nany place whatsoever, whether committed by civilian or by military agents: (a) violence to the life, health, or\nphysical or mental well-being of persons, in particular: (i) murder; (ii) torture of all kinds, whether physical or\nmental; (iii) corporal punishment; and (iv) mutilation;\nof the First Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 prohibits the following acts at any time\nand in all places whatsoever, whether committed by civilian or by military agents:\n1. Violence to life, health, or physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular;\n2. Murder;\n3. Torture of all kinds, whether physical or mental;\n4. Corporal punishment;\n5. Mutilations; and\n6. Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment; enforced\nprostitution and any form of indecent assault.\n\n8\n\n\f72. The Complainant State alleges the occupation of the eastern provinces of the country by the\nRespondent States' armed forces. It alleges also that most parts of the affected provinces have been under\nthe control of the rebels since 2nd August 1998, with the assistance and support of the Respondent States.\nIn support of its claim, it states that the Ugandan and Rwandan governments have acknowledged the\npresence of their respective armed forces in the eastern provinces of the country under what it calls the\n'fallacious pretext' of 'safeguarding their interests'. The [African] Commission takes note that this claim is\ncollaborated by the statements of the representatives of the Respondent States during the 27th Ordinary\nSession held in Algeria.\n73. Article 23 of the Charter guarantees to all peoples the right to national and international peace and\nsecurity. It provides further that the principles of solidarity and friendly relations implicitly affirmed by the\nCharter of the UN and reaffirmed by that of the OAU shall govern relations between states. The principles\nof solidarity and friendly relations contained in the Declaration on Principles of International Law\nConcerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the UN Charter (Res.\n2625 (XXV), adopted by the UN General Assembly on 24th October 1970, prohibits threat or use of force by\nStates in settling disputes. Principle 1 provides: \"Every State has the duty to refrain in its international\nrelations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any\nState, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the [UN]. Such a threat or use of force\nconstitutes a violation of international law and the Charter of the [UN] and shall never be employed as a\nmeans of settling international issues\".\n74. In the same vein, Article 33\n× Article 33 - 1. The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance\nof international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation,\nconciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful\nmeans of their own choice. 2. The Security Council shall, when it deems necessary, call upon the parties to\nsettle their dispute by such means.\nof the UN Charter enjoins \"parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the\nmaintenance of international peace and security...first of all, to seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry,\nmediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other\npeaceful means of their own choice\". Chapter VII of the same Charter outrightly prohibits threats to the\npeace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression. Article III of the OAU Charter states that \"The\nMember States, in pursuit of the purposes stated in Article II, solemnly affirm and declare their adherence\nto the following principles:\n1. Non-interference in the internal affairs of States;\n2. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State and for its inalienable right to\nindependent existence;\n3. Peaceful settlement of disputes by negotiation, mediation, conciliation or arbitration.\"\n75. It also contravenes the well-established principle of international law that States shall settle their\ndisputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not\nendangered. As noted in paragraph 66 above, there cannot be both national and international peace and\nsecurity guaranteed by the Charter with the conduct of the Respondent States in the eastern provinces of\nthe Complainant State.\n76. The [African] Commission therefore disapproves of the occupation of the Complainant's territory by the\narmed forces of the Respondent forces and finds it impermissible, even in the face of their argument of\nbeing in the Complainant's territory in order to safeguard their national interests and therefore in\ncontravention of Article 23 of the [African] Charter. The [African] Commission is of the strong belief that\nsuch interests would better be protected within the confines of the territories of the Respondent States.\n77. It bears repeating that the [African] Commission finds the conduct of the Respondent States in\noccupying territories of the Complainant State to be a flagrant violation of the rights of the peoples of the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo to their unquestionable and inalienable right to self-determination provided\nfor by Article 20 of the African Charter.\n78. As previously stated, the [African] Commission is entitled, by virtue of Articles 60 and 61 of the African\nCharter, to draw inspiration from international law on human and peoples' rights,...the Charter of the UN,\n9\n\n\fthe Charter of the OAU...and also take into consideration, as subsidiary measures to determine the\nprinciples of law, other general or special international conventions, laying down rules recognised by\nMember States of the OAU...general principles recognised by African States as well as legal precedents\nand doctrine. Invoking these provisions, the [African] Commission holds that the Four Geneva Conventions\nand the two Additional Protocols covering armed conflicts, fall on all fours with the category of special\ninternational conventions, laying down rules recognised by Member States of the OAU and also constitute\npart of the general principles recognised by African States, and to take [the] same into consideration in the\ndetermination of this case.\n79. The [African] Commission finds the killings, massacres, rapes, mutilations and other grave human\nrights abuses committed while the Respondent States' armed forces were still in effective occupation of the\neastern provinces of the Complainant State reprehensible and also inconsistent with their obligations under\nPart III of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949 and\nProtocol 1 of the Geneva Convention.\n80. They also constitute flagrant violations of Article 2 of the African Charter, such acts being directed\nagainst the victims by virtue of their national origin; and Article 4, which guarantees respect for life and the\nintegrity of one's person and prohibits the arbitrary deprivation [of] rights.\n81. The allegation of mass transfer of persons from the eastern provinces of the Complainant State to\ncamps in Rwanda, as alleged by the Complainant and not refuted by the Respondent, is inconsistent with\nArticle 18(1) of the African Charter, which recognises the family as the natural unit and basis of society and\nguarantees it appropriate protection. It is also a breach of the right to freedom of movement, and the right to\nleave and to return to one's country guaranteed under Articles 12 (1) and (2) of the African Charter\nrespectively.\n82. Article 56\n× Art 56. Protection of works and installations containing dangerous forces\n1. Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical\ngenerating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military\nobjectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among\nthe civilian population. Other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations\nshall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the\nworks or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.\n2. The special protection against attack provided by paragraph 1 shall cease: (a) for a dam or a dyke only if\nit is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military\noperations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; (b) for a nuclear electrical\ngenerating station only if it provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military\noperations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; (c) for other military\nobjectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations only if they are used in regular,\nsignificant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate\nsuch support.\n3. In all cases, the civilian population and individual civilians shall remain entitled to all the protection\naccorded them by international law, including the protection of the precautionary measures provided for in\nArticle 57. If the protection Ceases and any of the works, installations or military objectives mentioned in\nparagraph 1 is attacked, all practical precautions shall be taken to avoid the release of the dangerous\nforces.\n4. It is prohibited to make any of the works, installations or military objectives mentioned in paragraph 1 the\nobject of reprisals.\n5. The Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to avoid locating any military objectives in the vicinity of the\nworks or installations mentioned in paragraph 1. Nevertheless, installations erected for the sole purpose of\ndefending the protected works or installations from attack are permissible and shall not themselves be\nmade the object of attack, provided that they are not used in hostilities except for defensive actions\nnecessary to respond to attacks against the protected works or installations and that their armament is\nlimited to weapons capable only of repelling hostile action against the protected works or installations.\n10\n\n\f6. The High Contracting Parties and the Parties to the conflict are urged to conclude further agreements\namong themselves to provide additional protection for objects containing dangerous forces.\n7. In order to facilitate the identification of the objects protected by this article, the Parties to the conflict\nmay mark them with a special sign consisting of a group of three bright orange circles placed on the same\naxis, as specified in Article 16 of Annex I to this Protocol [Article 17 of Amended Annex]. The absence of\nsuch marking in no way relieves any Party to the conflict of its obligations under this Article.\nof the First Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 provides: \"(1) Works or installations\ncontaining dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be\nmade object of military attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause\nthe release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. (2) The\nspecial protection against attack provided by paragraph 1 shall cease: (a) for a dam or dyke only if it is\nused for other than its normal function in a regular, significant and direct support of military operations and\nif such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support... (3) In all cases, the civilian population\nand individual civilians shall remain entitled to all the protection accorded them by international law,\nincluding the protection of precautionary measures provided for in Article 57.\"\n83. As noted previously, taking Article 56, quoted above into account, and by virtue of Articles 60 and 61 of\nthe African Charter, the [African] Commission concludes that in besieging the hydroelectric dam in Lower\nCongo province, the Respondent States have violated the [African] Charter.\n84. The besieg[ing] of the hydroelectric dam may also be brought within the prohibition contained in The\nHague Convention (II) with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land which provides in Article 23\n× Art. 23. Besides the prohibitions provided by special Conventions, it is especially prohibited (a) To employ\npoison or poisoned arms; (b) To kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or\narmy; (c) To kill or wound an enemy who, having laid down arms, or having no longer means of defence,\nhas surrendered at discretion; (d) To declare that no quarter will be given; (e) To employ arms, projectiles,\nor material of a nature to cause superfluous injury; (f) To make improper use of a flag of truce, the national\nflag or military ensigns and uniform of the enemy, as well as the distinctive badges of the Geneva\nConvention; (g) To destroy or seize the enemy's property, unless such destruction or seizure be\nimperatively demanded by the necessities of war.\nthat \"Besides the prohibitions provided by special Conventions, it is especially prohibited...to destroy the\nenemy's property, unless such destruction or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war\".\nBy parity of reason, and bearing in mind Articles 60 and 61 of the [African] Charter, the Respondent States\nare in violation of the said Charter with regard to the just noted Article 23.\n85. The case of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia v. Zejnil Delalic, Zdravko Mucic, Hazim\nDelic and Esad Landzo (the Celebici Judgment; Nov., 16, 1998 at para. 587) is supportive of the [African]\nCommission's stance. It states, inter alia, that \"international law today imposes strict limitations on the\nmeasures which a party to an armed conflict may lawfully take in relation to the private and public property\nof an opposing party. The basic norms in this respect, which form part of customary international\nlaw...include the fundamental principle...that private property must be respected and cannot be\nconfiscated...pillage is formally forbidden\".\n86. The raping of women and girls, as alleged and not refuted by the Respondent States, is prohibited\nunder Article 76\n×\n1. Women shall be the object of special respect and shall be protected in particular against rape, forced\nprostitution and any other form of indecent assault.\n2. Pregnant women and mothers having dependent infants who are arrested, detained or interned for\nreasons related to the armed conflict, shall have their cases considered with the utmost priority.\n3. To the maximum extent feasible, the Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to avoid the pronouncement\nof the death penalty on pregnant women or mothers having dependent infants, for an offence related to the\narmed conflict. The death penalty for such offences shall not be executed on such women.\nof the First Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which provides that \"women shall be\nthe object of special respect and shall be protected in particular against rape, forced prostitution and any\n11\n\n\fform of indecent assault\". It also offends both the African Charter and the Convention on the Elimination of\nAll Forms of Discrimination against Women; and on the basis of Articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter\nfind the Respondent States in violation of the Charter.\n87. The [African] Commission condemns the indiscriminate dumping of and or mass burial of victims of the\nseries of massacres and killings perpetrated against the peoples of the eastern province of the\nComplainant State while the armed forces of the Respondent States were in actual fact occupying the said\nprovinces. The [African] Commission further finds these acts barbaric and in reckless violation of\nCongolese peoples' rights to cultural development guaranteed by Article 22 of the African Charter, and an\naffront on the noble virtues of the African historical tradition and values enunciated in the preamble to the\nAfrican Charter. Such acts are also forbidden under Article 34\n× Remains of deceased\n1. The remains of persons who have died for reasons related to occupation or in detention resulting from\noccupation or hostilities and those or persons not nationals of the country in which they have died as a\nresult of hostilities shall be respected, and the grave sites of all such persons shall be respected,\nmaintained and marked as provided for in Article 130 of the Fourth Convention, where their remains or\ngrave sites would not receive more favourable consideration under the Conventions and this Protocol.\n2. As soon as circumstances and the relations between the adverse Parties permit, the High Contracting\nParties in whose territories graves and, as the case may be, other locations of the remains of persons who\nhave died as a result of hostilities or during occupation or in detention are situated, shall conclude\nagreements in order: (a) to facilitate access to the gravesites by relatives of the deceased and by\nrepresentatives of official graves registration services and to regulate the practical arrangements for such\naccess; (b) to protect and maintain such gravesites permanently; (c) to facilitate the return of the remains of\nthe deceased and of personal effects to the home country upon its request or, unless that country objects,\nupon the request of the next of kin.\n3. In the absence of the agreements provided for in paragraph 2 (b) or (c) and if the home country or such\ndeceased is not willing to arrange at its expense for the maintenance of such gravesites, the High\nContracting Party in whose territory the gravesites are situated may offer to facilitate the return of the\nremains of the deceased to the home country. Where such an offer has not been accepted the High\nContracting Party may, after the expiry of five years from the date of the offer and upon due notice to the\nhome country, adopt the arrangements laid down in its own laws relating to cemeteries and graves.\n4. A High Contracting Party in whose territory the grave sites referred to in this Article are situated shall be\npermitted to exhume the remains only: (a) in accordance with paragraphs 2 (c) and 3, or (b) where\nexhumation is a matter or overriding public necessity, including cases of medical and investigative\nnecessity, in which case the High Contracting Party shall at all times respect the remains, and shall give\nnotice to the home country or its intention to exhume the remains together with details of the intended place\nof reinterment.\nof the First Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which provides for respect for the\nremains of such peoples and their gravesites. In disregarding the last provision, the Respondent States\nhave violated the African Charter on the basis of Articles 60 and 61 of this instrument.\n88. The looting, killing, mass and indiscriminate transfers of civilian population, the besiege and damage of\nthe hydro-dam, stopping of essential services in the hospital, leading to deaths of patients and the general\ndisruption of life and state of war that took place while the forces of the Respondent States were occupying\nand in control of the eastern provinces of the Complainant State are in violation of Article 14 guaranteeing\nthe right to property, Articles 16 and 17 (all of the African Charter), which provide for the rights to the best\nattainable state of physical and mental health and education, respectively.\n89. Part III of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949,\nparticularly in Article 27\n× Protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honour, their family\nrights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs. They shall at all times be\nhumanely treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and\nagainst insults and public curiosity. Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their\nhonour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault.\n12\n\n\fWithout prejudice to the provisions relating to their state of health, age and sex, all protected persons shall\nbe treated with the same consideration by the Party to the conflict in whose power they are, without any\nadverse distinction based, in particular, on race, religion or political opinion.\nHowever, the Parties to the conflict may take such measures of control and security in regard to protected\npersons as may be necessary as a result of the war.\nprovides for the humane treatment of protected persons at all times and for protection against all acts of\nviolence or threats and against insults and public curiosity. Further, it provides for the protection of women\nagainst any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent\nassault. Article 4\n× Persons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever,\nfind themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying\nPower of which they are not nationals.\nNationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention are not protected by it. Nationals of a neutral\nState who find themselves in the territory of a belligerent State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, shall\nnot be regarded as protected persons while the State of which they are nationals has normal diplomatic\nrepresentation in the State in whose hands they are.\nThe provisions of Part II are, however, wider in application, as defined in Article 13.\nPersons protected by the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and\nSick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949, or by the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of\nthe Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of 12 August 1949, or\nby the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949, shall not be\nconsidered as protected persons within the meaning of the present Convention.\nof the Convention defines a protected person as those who, at a given moment and in any manner\nwhatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or\nOccupying Power of which they are not nationals.\n90. The Complainant State alleges that between October and December 1998, the gold produced by the\nOKIMO firm and by local diggers yielded $100,000,000 (one hundred million US dollars) to Rwanda. By its\ncalculation, the coffee produced in the region and in North Kivu yielded about $70,000,000 (seventy million\nUS dollars) to Uganda in the same period. Furthermore, Rwanda and Uganda took over control of the fiscal\nand customs revenue collected respectively by the Directorate General of Taxes. The plunder of the riches\nof the eastern provinces of Congo is also affecting endangered animal species such as okapis, mountain\ngorillas, rhinoceros, and elephants.\n91. Indeed, the Respondent States, especially Uganda, ha[ve] refuted these allegations, pretending for\nexample that its troops never stepped in some of the regions they are accused of human rights violations\nand looting of the natural resources of the Complainant State. However, the African Commission has\nevidence that some of these facts did take place and are imputable to the armies and agents of the\nRespondent States. In fact, the UN ha[s] acknowledged that during the period when the armies of the\nRespondent States were in effective control over parts of the territory of the Complainant State, there were\nlootings of the natural resources of the Complainant State. The UN set up a Panel of Experts to investigate\nthis matter3\n92. The Report of the Panel of Experts, submitted to the Security Council of the UN in April 2001 (under\nreference S/2001/357) identified all the Respondent States among others actors, as involved in the conflict\nin the Democratic Republic of Congo 4 The report profusely provides evidence of the involvement of the\nRespondent states in the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Complainant State. It is stated in\nparagraph 5 of the summary of the Report: \"During this first phase (called mass-scale looting phase by the\nexperts), stockpiles of minerals, coffee, wood, livestock and money that were available in territories\nconquered by the armies of Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda were taken, and either transferred to those\ncountries or exported to international markets by their forces and nationals.\"5 .\n93. Paragraph 25 of the Report further states: \"The illegal exploitation of resources (of the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo) by Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda took different forms, including confiscation,\nextraction, forced monopoly and price-fixing. Of these, the first two reached proportions that made the war\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo a very lucrative business\".\n94. The [African] Commission therefore finds the illegal exploitation/looting of the natural resources of the\ncomplainant state in contravention of Article 21 of the African Charter, which provides: \"All peoples shall\nfreely dispose of their wealth and natural resources. This right shall be exercised in the exclusive interest of\nthe people. In no case shall a people be deprived of it... (2) States Parties to the present Charter shall\n13\n\n\findividually and collectively exercise the right to free disposal of their wealth and natural resources with a\nview to strengthening African Unity and solidarity.\"\n95. The deprivation of the right of the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in this case, to freely\ndispose of their wealth and natural resources, has also occasioned another violation - their right to their\neconomic, social and cultural development and of the general duty of States to individually or collectively\nensure the exercise of the right to development, guaranteed under Article 22 of the African Charter.\n96. For refusing to participate in any of the proceedings although duly informed and invited to respond to\nthe allegations, Burundi admits the allegations made against it.\n97.

Lawyers Fabien Segatwa, Moussa Coulibaly and Cédric Vergauwen, respectively called to the bars of\nBurundi, Niger and Brussels and members of ''Avocats Sans Fronti?res'' in Burundi, and acting on behalf of\nMr Gaetan Bwampamye, currently detained at the Mpimba Prison (Bujumbura) present the facts of the\ncase as follows:\n2. On 25 th September 1997, Mr Gaëtan Bwampamye was sentenced to death by the Criminal Chamber of\nthe Appeal Court of Ngozi after being convicted for having (in Ruhoro, on 21 October 1993, as author,\nco-author or accomplice) incited the population to commit crimes, and for having (under the same\ncircumstance, organised as attack geared towards provoking massacres), set up barricades with a view to\nhindering the enforcement of public order, all of which are offences under Articles 212, 417 and 425 of the\nPenal Code of Burundi.\n3. On 2 nd October 1997, he filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Burundi. In support of his appeal, he\ninvoked six grounds, including the violation of Article 75 of the Penal Procedure Code of Burundi, Article 14\nparagraph 3(d)\n× Article 14 3. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the\nfollowing minimum guarantees, in full equality: ...\n(d) To be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own\nchoosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance\nassigned to him, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any\nsuch case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it;\nof the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , as well as Article 51 of Decree No. 100/103 of\n29 th August 1979, defining the status of the profession of lawyers. According to the complainants, the latter\nargument was invoked by the accused to denounce the fact that he was denied the services of his counsel\nduring the public prosecution's closing address and that, in spite of his request for assistance, he was\ncompelled to prepare his own defence.\n4. The Complainants assert that on 3 rd June 1997, the Criminal Chamber of the Court of Appeal closed the\nhearing of the witnesses, and on account of the volume of the case, decided to adjourn the hearing to 20 th\nAugust 1997.\n5. During the hearing of 20 th August 1997, the prosecution refused to make its closing address, arguing\nthat it needed more time to study the contents of the statement of the defence counsel. The Criminal\nChamber therefore decided to adjourn the case to 25 September 1997. On that day, the counsel for the\ndefence was unable to attend the hearing due to ill health. Despite the repeated requests of Mr\nBwampanye for the case to be adjourned to another date, the Chamber decided to hear the prosecution,\nand compelled the accused to defend himself, without the assistance of his lawyer. The verdict sentencing\nhim to death was rendered that same day at the end of the submissions.\n6. The Complainants point out that the Supreme Court had rejected this argument, which the accused had\ninvoked before it. The accused had wanted the ruling of the Ngozi Court of Appeal quashed on the grounds\nthat insofar as the court is concerned, the law does not obligate the judge to designate a lawyer, but he\nmay do so.\n7. The Supreme Court continues in the following terms \"further, whereas for the specific case in question,\nthe accused has always been assisted by a lawyer, the evidence being that his lawyer had already\nsubmitted his 19 page written arguments on 20 th August 1997, that has no furthermore they had already\npleaded together in the public hearing, whereas in the face of such situation, the plaintiff justification in\nsaying that the judge should have designated a lawyer for him whereas he already had one who had\nalready accomplished all the essential duties expected of a lawyer; that consequently, this argument is also\nto be rejected\" .\n8. This line of argument of the Supreme Court is challenged by the complainants who raise a certain\nnumber of points of law, including inter alia , the ignorance according to them by the said court of the\nprinciples of the right of defence and judicial assistance. They claim that, this ruling of the Supreme Court is\n1\n\n\fnot only contrary to the provisions of Article 73 of Burundi's Criminal Procedure Code which unequivocally\nestablishes the right to judicial assistance but also the general principle of oral submissions in criminal\nproceedings.\n9. They assert on the one hand that \"whilst it is customary for a lawyer to communicate his pleas to the\nprosecution before the closing address of the latter, no written rule requires him to do so\" . On the other\nhand, the complainants assert that \"the lawyer is obviously never bound by the contents of a statement of\ndefence deposited before the hearing. Such a statement therefore is not exhaustive and may only be\nconfined to certain aspects of the case and not focus on issues that the defence intends to elaborate on\nlater at the bar. Counsel for the defence may also renounce certain arguments contained in his note,\ndepending on for instance the issues raised by the prosecution. This freedom is at the very core of the\nrights of the defence. Before any decision, they assert, there is the unconditional right to oral submissions\nand freedom of speech\" .\n10. The Complainants assert that this same freedom of speech was accorded to the prosecution, and recall\nthat the \"prosecutor is never bound by the written closing speeches of his office.\" The principle is\nfurthermore established by the old saying that \"the written word is not, as free as the spoken word\" . They\nvehemently assert, that in indicating in its judgement that the lawyer had already submitted a 19-page\nstatement of defence and that in this respect, he had accomplished all the fundamental duties of a lawyer\",\nthe Court ignores all the principles that have just been set forth and, consequently, authorises a blatant\nviolation of the rights of the defence in general and the rights of judicial assistance in particular\".\n11. On the basis of the foregoing, the Complainant whilst stressing that the aim of the present complaint is\nto highlight the above-mentioned violations, call on the Commission to rule that:\n1.\n2. By refusing Mr Gaetan Bwampamye the assistance of his legal counsel to plead his case, the\nCriminal Chamber of the Ngozi Court of Appeal held a hearing which was not equitable under the\nAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and all the relevant international instruments.\n3. To establish the violation by the Republic of Burundi of the rights enshrined in the Charter more\nspecifically, the violation of Article 7.1.c of the Charter and the general principles on the rights of the\ndefence;\n4. To report its findings to the parties concerned and to the Assembly of Heads of State and\nGovernment of the OAU.\n\nProcedure\n12. The communication is dated 11 th April 1999. It was sent to the Secretariat by E-mail.\n13. On account of the fact that the judgement of the Ngozi Court of Appeal (a major piece written in Kirundi)\nwas still being translated, the communication could not be brought before the Commission during its 25 th\nOrdinary Session held in Bujumbura, in May 1999. Towards the end of the said Session however, the\nplaintiffs forwarded to the Secretariat the outstanding documents, thus enabling it to complete the file on\nthe communication and bring the matter before the 26 th Session of the Commission.\n14. At its 26 th Session, the Commission heard from the representatives of Mr Bwampamye who had come\nto present their position on the matter. After a long debate, the Commission reached a decision to be\nseized of the communication. Mr Bwampamye was represented by the following lawyers: Segatwa Fabien,\nSeydou Doumbia and Boubine Toure (all of them being members of Avocats Sans Fronti?res ).\n15. On 13 th December 1999, the Secretariat informed the parties of this decision and a letter signed by the\nChairman of the Commission, Rule 111 requesting a stay of execution was addressed to the Burundian\nHead of State.\n16. On 15 th February 2000, the Burundi office of Avocats Sans Fronti?res acknowledged receipt of the\nletter of 13 th December 1999, addressed to it by the Secretariat without, however, communicating its\nobservations as regards the admissibility of the communication.\n\n2\n\n\f17. At its 27 th Ordinary Session held in Algiers, Algeria, the Commission examined the case and declared\nit admissible and requested the parties to furnish it with arguments on its merits. It also requested the\nChairman of the Commission to repeat its earlier appeal for stay of execution pending the determination of\nthe communication.\n18. The above decision was communicated to parties on 1 st August 2000.\n19.During its 28 th Session, the Respondent State and Counsel for the complainant presented their written\nand oral submissions before the Commission\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n20. Article 56(5) of the Charter stipulates that \"communications relating to human and peoples'\nrights...received by the Commission shall be considered if they...are sent after exhausting local remedies, if\nany, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged...\"\n21. It is apparent from an examination of the documents appended to the dossier that the verdict handed\ndown on 25 th September 1997, by the Ngozi Court of Appeal, sentencing Mr Gaëtan Bwampamye to death\nwas confirmed on 5 October of the same year by the Supreme Court of Burundi. The Commission notes,\nconsequently, that the domestic remedies had been duly exhausted. For these reasons, it declares the\ncommunication admissible.\n22. In its oral submission, the respondent state argued that the Complainant had not exhausted other local\nremedies which include \"le recours dans l'intér?t de la loi\" , revision and the plea for pardon.\n23. The Commission however holds the view that the Complainant could only benefit from the first two\nremedies at the initiative of the Ministry of Justice and also as a result of discovery of new facts that may\nlead to reopening the file. With regard to the plea for pardon, it is not a judicial remedy but serves to affect\nthe execution of a sentence. For these reasons the Commission maintains its decision on admissibility.\nMerits\n24. Article 7 (1) (c) of the Charter states: \"Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This\ncomprises...the right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice\" .\n25. In its verdict of 5 th October 1997, the Supreme Court of Burundi adjudged and stated:\n\"Whereas this Court is of the view that the law implies no obligation on the part of the judge to nominate a\nlawyer, though he may do so; Whereas in the case under consideration, the accused had always been\nassisted by a lawyer, proof being that his 19 page written plea of 20 th August was filed by his lawyer; and\nthat they had appeared together at the public sitting; Whereas, in view of such situation, the appellant has\nno reason to claim that the judge should appoint a lawyer for him, since he already had one who had\nperformed all essential functions of a lawyer for him; this procedure is, therefore, also hereby rejected...\"\n26. The Commission recalls that the right to fair trial involves fulfilment of certain objective criteria, including\nthe right to equal treatment, the right to defence by a lawyer, especially where this is called for by the\ninterests of justice, as well as the obligation on the part of courts and tribunals to conform to international\nstandards in order to guarantee a fair trial to all. The Commission shall examine the verdict of the Ngozi\nCourt of Appeal, as well as that of the Supreme Court in light of the above criteria.\n27. The right to equal treatment by a jurisdiction, especially in criminal matters, means, in the first place,\nthat both the defence and the public prosecutor shall have equal opportunity to prepare and present their\npleas and indictment during the trial. Simply put, they should argue their cases before the jurisdiction on an\nequal footing. Secondly it entails the equal treatment of all accused persons by jurisdictions charged with\ntrying them. This does not mean that identical treatment should be meted to all accused. The idea here is\nthe principle that when objective facts are alike, the response of the judiciary should also be similar. There\nis a breach of the principle of equality if judicial or administrative decisions are applied in a discriminatory\nmanner. In the case under consideration, it is expected of the Commission to attend to the first aspect, that\nis, observation of the rule of equality of the means utilised by the defence and the prosecution.\n28. The right to defence also implies that at each stage of the criminal proceedings, the accused and his\ncounsel should be able to reply to the indictment of the public prosecutor and should, in any case, be the\nlast to intervene before the court retires for deliberations.\n3\n\n\f29. The Ngozi Court of Appeal had on 25 th September 1997, handed down a verdict sentencing Mr\nBwampamye to death, thereby following the prayer of the public prosecutor, paying no heed to the\naccused's prayer for adjournment of the case, pleading the absence of his lawyer. The Commission holds\nthe view that the judge should have upheld the prayer of the accused, in view of the irreversible character\nof the penalty involved. This was all the more imperative considering that during the 20 >\n\n4\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"7","date":"November 6, 2000","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"Right to fair trial, Arrest and detention","activity_report":"14th Activity Report : 2000 – 2001","outcome":"4"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080c1b89","title":"Interights (on behalf of Pan African Movement and Citizens for Peace in Eritrea) v Ethiopia and Interights (on behalf of Pan African Movement and Inter African Group)","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559319334,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"233_99-234_99 Interights (on behalf of Pan African Movement and Citizens for Peace in....pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"146355932014844q5qvcot1brzfr.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/146355932014844q5qvcot1brzfr.pdf","size":39137},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"233/99-234/99 Interights (on behalf of Pan African\nMovement and Citizens for Peace in Eritrea) v Ethiopia\nand Interights (on behalf of Pan African Movement and\nInter African Group) / Eritrea\nSummary of Facts\n1. The Complainant alleges that sometime in the second quarter of 1998 there was an international armed\nconflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia that led to the beginning of active hostilities between the two\ncountries.\n2. During this period it is alleged by the Complainant that thousands of persons of Ethiopian nationality\nwere expelled from Eritrea, either directly or constructively by the creation of conditions in which they had\nno choice other than to leave Eritrea. In particular, over 2,500 were forcibly expelled and dumped at the\nborder where there was ferocious fighting and heavily infested with anti-personnel land mines.\n3. It is also alleged that between June 1998 and July 1999, more than sixty one thousand people of\nEritrean ethnic descent who are legal residents or citizens of Ethiopia were deported from Ethiopia. Most of\nthese are urban deportees.\n4. The Complainant asserts that in both cases, thousands of persons of Ethiopian origin and those of\nEritrean origin were arrested and interned in Eritrea and Ethiopia respectively under harsh conditions with\nno visitation rights for their families, no food, clothing and toilet facilities for extended periods of time.\n5. The Complainant alleges that some Ethiopian women and young girls were tortured and raped in the\naffected areas by Eritrean soldiers.\n6. The Complainant also alleges that most of the deportees were subjected to cruel, inhuman and\ndegrading treatment. Furthermore, the governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia arbitrarily deprived most of the\ndeportees [of] their property.\n7. Specifically in the case of those persons deported by the government of Eritrea, some deportees were\nforced to work without salaries in exchange for protection. Yet others were forced out of their rental\naccommodation, suffering forcible eviction and homelessness as a result.\n8. While in the case of those persons deported by the government of Ethiopia, the deportees, prior to their\ndeportation were required to transfer their rights over their property in Ethiopia by a power of attorney to a\nlegal agent. In compliance with this, husbands often designated their wives as their legal agents, only to\nfind that their wives were given a month or two to sell their properties and were then deported a week or\ntwo after they were told to sell. In effect, the deportation was accompanied in most cases by an\nexpropriation of the property of the deportees. In some cases some deportees also had their rental\nproperties taken over. Some bank accounts were frozen, and some savings books were destroyed, making\nit impossible for the deportees or their designated agents to gain access to such savings.\n9. The Complainant claims that while effecting the said deportations, parents and children were forcibly\nseparated without any provision for the care, feeding, and housing of the children. As at the time of\nsubmission of the complaints, neither parents nor children can travel across the Eritrean-Ethiopian border\nand even telephone communication is impractical.\n\nComplaint\n10. The Complainant alleges violations of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7(1), 12(1), (2), (4) and (5), 14, 15, 16 and\n18(1) of the African Charter.\n\nProcedure\n11. The complaint lodged by INTERIGHTS against Eritrea and Ethiopia was received at the Secretariat of\nthe African Commission on 5th October 1999.\n12. At its 26th Ordinary Session held in Kigali, Rwanda, the African Commission decided to be seized of\ncommunications 233/99 and 234/99 and requested the parties to furnish it with additional information on its\n1\n\n\fadmissibility in accordance with Article 56 of the Charter.\n13. On 17th January 2000, the Secretariat conveyed the above decision to the parties and forwarded a copy\nof the summary of the communication and the original text of the complaint together with the documents\nattached thereto.\n14. On 30th April 2000, during the 27th Ordinary Session of the African Commission, the Allard K.\nLowenstein International Human Rights Law Clinic at the Yale Law School in the United States submitted\nan amicus curiae brief to the African Commission on the complaint brought against Ethiopia.\n15. At its 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria, the African Commission heard the representatives of the\nparties on the admissibility of the case. It declared both communications admissible and requested parties\nto submit their arguments on the merits. The various parties were informed accordingly of the decision of\nthe African Commission.\n16. At its 28th Ordinary Session held in Cotonou, Benin, the African Commission heard both parties.\n17. At its 29th Ordinary Session held in Libya, the African Commission heard both parties and decided to\nconsolidate communications 233/99 and 234/99. The African Commission deferred consideration both\ncommunications on the merits to the 30th Ordinary Session and invited parties to the communications\n233/99 and 234/99 to submit arguments for the purpose of clarifications in terms of Rule 104 of the Rules of\nProcedure of the African Commission:\n1. On the desirability or otherwise of considering the communications under the provisions of Article 47\nto Article 54 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights on communications between\nStates and to follow the procedure laid down thereunder;\n2. On the extent to which matters covered by the complaint are the subject of the Peace Agreement\nbetween the Government of Democratic Federal Republic of Ethiopia and the Government of State\nof Eritrea signed in Algiers on 12th December 2000, including the mechanism for the consideration\nof claims by individuals in either State whose citizenship may be in dispute Article 5(8)\n× Article 5.\n8) Claims shall be submitted to the Commission by each of the parties on its own behalf and on\nbehalf of its nationals, including both natural and juridical persons. All claims submitted to the\nCommission shall be filed no later than one year from the effective date of this agreement. Except\nfor claims submitted to another mutually agreed settlement mechanism in accordance with\nparagraph 16 or filed in another forum prior to the effective date of this agreement, the Commission\nshall be the sole forum for adjudicating claims described in paragraph 1 or filed under paragraph 9\nof this Article, and any such claims which could have been and were not submitted by that deadline\nshall be extinguished, in accordance with international law.\n;\nAnd in the alternative:\n3. Indicate the relevance or otherwise of Article 56 (7); and\n4. Whether a final decision on the merits at this stage will have an impact and what effect, if any, that\nwould have on the peace process between the two countries.\n18. On 18th June 2001 both parties were informed of the African Commission's decision and were invited to\nforward their submissions on the above-mentioned questions.\n19. At its 30th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the African Commission heard oral\nsubmissions from all the parties and decided as follows :• the Governments of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the State of Eritrea should\nsubmit claims relating to the abovementioned communication to the Claims Commission;\n• that any correspondence relating to communication 233/99 and 234/99 made to the Claims\nCommission should be copied and forwarded to the African Commission;\n• to postpone further consideration on the merits of communication 233/99 and 234/99 to the 31st\nOrdinary Session to ascertain whether matters covered by the communication are also covered by\nand have been submitted to the Claims Commission.\n20. On 24th October 2001 the parties were informed of the decision of the African Commission.\n\n2\n\n\f21. During the 31st Ordinary Session of the African Commission, Eritrea submitted a letter from the\nPresident of the Claims Commission. In that letter the President of the Claims Commission states to the\neffect that, Eritrea and Ethiopia can provide the African Commission with copies of their statements of claim\nor other appropriate information relating to the Claims Commission if required by the African Commission.\n22. At its 31st Ordinary Session, the African Commission heard oral submissions from all the parties to the\ncommunication and decided to defer consideration of the matter to the 32nd Session in order to allow the\nComplainants time to forward their written responses to the written submissions of Ethiopia.\n23. On 7th June 2002, all the parties to the above-mentioned communication were informed of the African\nCommission's decision. INTERIGHTS was requested to forward its written response to the Secretariat of\nthe African Commission within 2 months from the date of notification.\n24. On 30th July 2002, INTERIGHTS was reminded that the Secretariat was awaiting to receive their written\nsubmissions on or before the 7th August 2002. There has been no response from INTERIGHTS thus far.\n25. At its 32nd Ordinary Session, the African Commission heard oral submissions from the State of Eritrea\nand decided to defer consideration of this communication to the 33rd Ordinary Session. Parties to the\ncommunication were informed accordingly.\n26. At its 33rd Ordinary Session, held from 15th to 29th May 2003, in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\ndecided to suspend consideration of these communications sine die.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n27. The admissibility of communications brought pursuant to Article 55 of the Charter is governed by the\nconditions stipulated in Article 56 of the Charter. This Article lays down seven (7) conditions, which\ngenerally must be fulfilled by a Complainant for a communication to be declared admissible.\n28. Of the seven conditions, the government of Ethiopia claims that the Complainants have not fulfilled\nthree; namely Article 56 (1), (5) and (7). Additionally, it questions the neutrality, credibility and integrity of\nthe NGOs submitting the communication.\n29. The State of Eritrea on its part claims that the Complainants have not fulfilled two conditions, namely\nArticles 56 (6) and (7).\n30. Article 56 (1) of the African Charter stipulates: \"Communications relating to human and peoples' rights\nreferred to in Article 55..... shall be considered if they: (1) Indicate their authors even if the latter request\nanonymity.\"\n31. The government of Ethiopia submits that the Complainants being NGOs are expected to provide the\nnames of their representatives, and since they failed to do so in their letter of August 1999 the African\nCommission should reject the communication.\n32. Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia questions the neutrality, credibility and integrity of the NGOs\nsubmitting the communications. This, the government alleges, is evidenced by the superficial treatment\ngiven by the Complainant NGOs to the plight of thousands of Ethiopians suffering in the hands of the\nEritrean government whereas with respect to Eritrea, they submitted a detailed verbatim report. Ethiopia\nthus claims that the submission on Ethiopia is only an attempt by the Complainant to give it a semblance of\ncredibility.\n33. The African Commission is of the view that in terms of Article 56 (1) of the African Charter, it is enough\nif the said complaint bears, as in this case, the name of one of the organisation's representatives. Thus the\npresent complaint cannot be declared inadmissible on the basis of Article 56 (1).\n34. With respect to the question of the neutrality, credibility and integrity of the NGOs submitting the\ncommunication, the African Commission does not consider this issue as one that falls within the\nrequirement for the admissibility of the communication as stipulated under Article 56 of the Charter. In any\ncase, the evidence before the African Commission does not lead it to uphold the submission of the\ngovernment of Ethiopia on the credibility, neutrality and integrity of the NGOs particularly INTERIGHTS\nwhich effectively became the Complainant.\n35. Article 56 (5) of the African Charter stipulates: \"Communications relating to human and peoples rights\nreferred to in Article 55..... shall be considered if they: (5) Are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any\nunless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged\".\n36. Regarding the issue of exhaustion of local remedies, the government of Ethiopia submits that the\nComplainants have not availed themselves of the remedies available at the local courts before approaching\n3\n\n\fthe African Commission.\n37. The Complainant asserts, and the African Commission is of the opinion that there were no domestic\nremedies available to the Complainants, as a practical matter in this case. In coming to this decision the\nAfrican Commission relies on its decision on the issue in communication 71/92 Rencontre africaine pour la\ndéfense des Droits de l'Homme/Zambia, a case that involved mass deportation and transfer of multiple\nvictims. In this case the African Commission observed: \"The mass nature of the arrests, the fact that victims\nwere kept in detention prior to their expulsion, and the speed with which the expulsions were carried out\ngave the Complainants no opportunity to establish the legality of these actions in the courts. For\nComplainants to contact their families, much less attorneys was not possible. Thus the recourse referred to\nby the government ... was, as a practical matter, not available to the Complainants.\"\n38. The government of Eritrea alleges that the Complainant has not fulfilled the conditions stipulated under\nArticle 56 (6) of the African Charter. Article 56 (6) of the African Charter reads: \"Communications relating to\nhuman and peoples' rights referred to in Article 55..... shall be considered if they: (6) are submitted within a\nreasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted or from the time local remedies are\nexhausted or from the date the commission is seized with the matter.\"\n39. The African Commission is of the view that bearing in mind its decision in relation to Article 56 (5)\ncompliance with the provisions of Article 56 (6) of the African Charter by the Complainant is rendered\ninapplicable.\n40. Both the governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia also raise an objection to the African Commission\nadmitting the communications stating that the Complainants did not comply with the provisions of Article 56\n(7) of the African Charter.\n41. At its 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria, after hearing the representatives of the parties on the\nadmissibility of the case, the African Commission decided to declare both communications admissible.\n42. It is to be recalled that at its 29th Ordinary Session held in Libya, the African Commission heard oral\nsubmissions from all the parties and decided to consolidate Communications 233/99 and 234/99. The\nAfrican Commission also postponed further consideration on the merits of the case to the 30th Ordinary\nSession and invited parties to the communication 233/99 and 234/99 to submit arguments for the purpose\nof clarifications in terms of Rule 104 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\nClarifications Sought by the African Commission in Terms of Rule 104 of the Rules of Procedure\n\nThe desirability or otherwise of considering the communications under Articles 47 - 54 of the\nAfrican Charter\n43. The Respondent States argue that it is undesirable that the communications before the African\nCommission be converted into State-to-State proceedings. The government of Ethiopia takes this position\nbecause the two countries, Ethiopia and Eritrea have already negotiated and signed a Peace Agreement\nwith regard to the conflict that gave rise to the human rights violations that were committed by the\nrespective States. Therefore the African Commission should discontinue considering the complaints before\nit and let the Ethio-Eritrean Claims Commission handle the matters raised within the complaints.\n44. The communications presently before the African Commission are governed by Articles 55 - 57 of the\nCharter, a category of cases clearly distinct from complaints governed by Articles 47 - 54 of the Charter.\nThe provisions of the African Charter and the Rules of Procedure do not provide for any procedure to\nconvert non-State communications into inter-state communications. The initiation of an inter-state complaint\nis dependent on the voluntary exercise of the sovereign will of a State party to the Charter, which decision\ncan only be made by States in accordance with the Charter. From the submissions of the Respondent\nStates, the African Commission comes to the conclusion that Ethiopia and Eritrea do not wish to initiate an\ninter-state complaint before the African Commission; furthermore they believe that the complaint against\nthem that is before the African Commission should be dismissed as they believe that the Ethio-Eritrean\nClaims Commission would be better suited to handle the matters raised in those complaints. The African\nCommission cannot and will therefore not consider the communication under Articles 47 - 54, a procedure\nrelating to the consideration of inter-state communications.\nThe extent to which matters covered by the complaints are the subject of the Peace Agreement\n4\n\n\fbetween the Governments [of] Ethiopia and Eritrea signed on 12th December 2000, including the\nmechanism for the consideration of claims by individuals in either State whose citizenship may be\nin dispute (Article 5 (8)\n× Claims shall be submitted to the Commission by each of the parties on its own behalf and on behalf of its\nnationals, including both natural and juridical persons.

The matters raised by the Complainants before the African Commission relate to abuse of human rights\nof people in violation of the provisions of the African Charter by the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea\nduring the period of the Ethiopia-Eritrean Conflict.\n46.

As part of their submissions on the clarification sought by the African Commission, the government of\nEthiopia forwarded documents relating to the Claims Commission's hearings that were held from 1st to 2nd\nJuly 2001. During the hearings, the Claims Commission addressed itself to the nature of the claims that the\ngovernments of Ethiopia and Eritrea will place before it. The Claims Commission was of the view that its\njurisdiction under Article 5 (1)\n× Article 5\n1. Consistent with the Framework Agreement, in which the parties commit themselves to addressing the\nnegative socio-economic impact of the crisis on the civilian population, including the impact on those\npersons who have been deported, a neutral Claims Commission shall be established. The mandate of the\nCommission is to decide through binding arbitration all claims for loss, damage or injury by one\nGovernment against the other, and by nationals (including both natural and juridical persons) of one party\nagainst the Government of the other party or entities owned or controlled by the other party that are\n\n(a) related to the conflict that was the subject of the Framework Agreement, the Modalities for its\nImplementation and the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, and\n\n(b) result from violations of international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, or\nother violations of international law. The Commission shall not hear claims arising from the cost of military\noperations, preparing for military operations, or the use of force, except to the extent that such claims\ninvolve violations of international humanitarian law.\nincludes two basic types of claims. The Parties may file traditional Inter-State claims under the principles of\nthe law of State Responsibility for injury to the Claimant State. These may include claims for injuries to the\nState occurring by reason of injuries to its nationals in violation of international law.\nOr, the Parties may choose to file the claims of individual nationals that fall within the scope of Article 5(1).\nThe Claims Commission is open to either approach, or to a combination of them, so long as no duplicate\ncompensation for the same injury results.\n49. At the 31st Session of the African Commission, both the Respondent States asserted that they had filed\nwith the Claims Commission, all the matters covered by communication 233/99 and 234/99.\n50. The government of Eritrea contended that it made claims for violations of the rights of Eritrean citizens\nand/or Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean ethnic origin and that these claims also constitute allegations of\nviolations of the African Charter and of international law (Statements of Claims Nos. 15, 16, 17, 19 and 21).\nThe claims include the internment without trial of civilians because of their membership in political\norganisations or for reasons of their ethnicity or national origin. The government of Eritrea stated that it\nmade claims on behalf of persons of Eritrean citizenship and/or Eritrean national origin for:\n• The illegal internment of civilians in concentration camps without formal accusation or trial;\n• The physical maltreatment and torture of such individuals;\n\n6\n\n\f• The discriminatory dismissals from employment, evictions from rental property, and seizure of\nproperty from persons of Eritrean national origin who are still present in Ethiopia.\n51. The government of Ethiopia also argues that the allegations presented in this communication have\nbeen submitted to the Claims Commission. They state that in their Statement of Claim No. 5 that they\nsubmitted before the Claims Commission, they made claims for the unlawful treatment of Ethiopian\nnationals living in Eritrea, including arbitrary detention, mass internment, torture, abuse, murder, forced\ndisappearances, forced conscription into the military, confiscation of property and systematic rape of\nEthiopian women. The Statement of Claim also includes factual representations relating to the Eritrean\ngovernment's policy of discrimination against Ethiopians in Eritrea, including arbitrary dismissal of Ethiopian\nnationals from public and private employment in Eritrea; Eritrea's unlawful restrictions on the freedom of\nmovement, including exit from Eritrea and forceful expulsion of Ethiopians and unlawful and inhuman\nconditions during the expulsion of Ethiopian nationals from Eritrea.\nThe Relevance or Otherwise of Article 56 (7) of The African Charter\n\n52. Article 56 (7) of the African Charter provides: \"Communication relating to human and peoples' rights\nreferred to in Article 55 received by the Commission, shall be considered if they: (7) do not deal with cases\nwhich have been settled by these States involved in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the\n[UN], or the Charter of the [OAU] or the provisions of the present Charter.\"\n53. Article 56 (7) of the Charter precludes the African Commission from considering cases that have been\nsettled by States in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the UN, or the Charter of the OAU or\nthe provisions of the present Charter.\n54. The Complainant refers the African Commission to its decision in communication 59/91 Emgba\nMekongo Louis/Cameroon, where it held that mediation by political institutions such as the European Union\nwas irrelevant to Article 56 (7) of the Charter. INTERIGHTS thus submits that this holding applies with\nequal force to the political organs of the OAU.\n55. The Claims Commission created by a Peace Agreement should not be viewed as a political organ of\nthe OAU; rather it is a body that has been established under a Peace Agreement and which, under Article 5\n(13)\n× Article 5\n13. In considering claims, the Commission shall apply relevant rules of international law. The Commission\nshall not have the power to make decisions ex aequo et bono.\n, is bound to apply rules of international law and cannot make decisions ex aequo et bono. Indeed the\nClaims Commission has ruled that in dealing with evidence, they must apply evidentiary rules that prove or\ndisprove disputed facts (see decision number 4 of the Claims Commission). The Claims Commission\ntherefore has the capacity, unlike the African Commission to deal with complex matters such as the\ncitizenship status of the individuals, what amount of compensation shall be awarded and to whom, in\nrespect of the violations that they have suffered. Such was the complexity that the African Commission was\nfaced with in Emgba Mekongo Louis/Cameroon (supra) where it found a violation of Mekongo's rights but\nstated \"that it was unable to determine their amount and the quantum should be determined under the law\nof Cameroon\".\n56. In communication 60/91 Constitutional Rights Project/Nigeria, the African Commission held that it would\nnot rely on the process or mechanism of a \"discretionary, extra-ordinary ... non-judicial nature\" or that \"have\nno obligation to decide according to legal principles\" to preclude the admissibility of a communication under\nArticle 56(7) of the African Charter. The African Commission would say that this is clearly not the case with\nregard to the Claims Commission as has been demonstrated by Article 5(13) of the Peace Agreement that\nprovides that it is bound to apply rules of international law and cannot make decisions ex aequo et bono.\nThis therefore puts the Claims Commission under those bodies envisaged under Article 56 (7).\n57. From the submissions of the Respondent States, it seems to the African Commission, that the matters\nbrought before it, are matters that have been placed before the Claims Commission which can therefore\nadequately deal with such matters.\n58. At the 31st Ordinary Session, the Complainants requested the African Commission to defer\nconsideration of these communications to the 32nd Ordinary Session to enable them submit written\nresponses to the Respondent States' submissions. The African Commission granted the request and\n7\n\n\finformed the parties accordingly. The Secretariat of the African Commission has written to the\nComplainants asking them to forward the stated written responses but there has been no reaction from\nthem.\n59. In principle the appropriate remedy of those claims submitted to the Claims Commission should be\nmonetary compensation. However, it is also within the Claims Commission's mandate to provide other\ntypes of remedies that are acceptable within international practice. It is probable that the African\nCommission will reach a decision finding the Respondent States in violation of the rights of the individuals\non whose behalf INTERIGHTS is acting. However, as was the case in Emgba Mekongo Louis/Cameroon\n(supra), the African Commission would certainly be constrained in awarding compensation and may have\nto refer this matter to the Claims Commission and at which point the matter would certainly be time barred.\n60. While the African Commission would have opted to proceed and deal with the instant communications,\nthe Respondent States Parties have assured the African Commission that all the issues before the African\nCommission will be brought before the Claims Commission.\n\nHolding\n\nFor these reasons, the African Commission decides as follows:\n• to suspend consideration of communication 233/99 and 234/99 sine die, and await the decision of\nthe Claims Commission with regard to matters contained in this communication;\n• that the Respondent States keep the African Commission regularly informed of the process before\nthe Claims Commission with particular reference to the matters contained in these communications;\n• the Republic of Ethiopia and the State of Eritrea are requested to transmit a copy of the text of the\ndecision of the Claims Commission to the Secretariat of the African Commission as soon as it is\ndelivered;\n• in the event that the Claims Commission does not fully address the human rights violations\ncontained herein, to reopen the matter for consideration;\n• reserves its decision on the merits of these communications.\n\nTaken at the 33rd Ordinary Session in Niamey, Niger May 2003.\n\n8\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"16","date":"May 29, 2003","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"Liberty of the person, Right to food, Personal integrity, Regional human rights law, Discrimination, Damages and compensation for victims, Torture and ill treatment, Equality and equal protection before the law, Freedom of movement, Refugee rights, Women's rights","activity_report":"16th Activity Report : 2002 - 2003","outcome":"14"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080c3470","title":"Curtis Francis Doebbler  Sudan","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559326184,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"235_00 Curtis Francis Doebbler _ Sudan.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"14635593269518dh5yzf3j1owp14i.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/14635593269518dh5yzf3j1owp14i.pdf","size":85640},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"235/00 Curtis Francis Doebbler / Sudan\nSummary of Alleged Facts\n1. The Complainant represents 14,000 Ethiopian refugees who fled Ethiopia prior to 1991 during the\nMengistu regime and lived in Sudan and were a subject of forced repatriation pursuant to a decision\nadopted by the Respondent State and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in\nSeptember 1999. The Complainant states that during the 1980s and early 1990s an estimated 80,000\nEthiopians entered Sudan fleeing from persecution and from events disturbing public order in Ethiopia.\n2. The Complainant alleges that the current Government in Ethiopia was formed by officials of the Tigrayan\nPeople's Liberation Front (TPLF) party, who were allies with the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party\n(EPRF) during the struggle against the Mengistu regime. The supporters of the EPRP are allegedly the\nmain target of repression by the Ethiopian government throughout the country.\n3. The Complainant alleges that all Ethiopian refugees in Sudan were previously granted asylum by the\nGovernment of Sudan in accordance with its international obligations. The United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees, the agency responsible for the protection of refugees worldwide, also\nhonoured this recognition until September 1999.\n4. The Complainant alleges that in September 1999, the Government of Sudan signed an agreement with\nthe UNHCR to invoke the Cessation Clauses Article 1(C) (5)\n× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no\nlonger, because the circumstances in connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have\nceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;\nProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able\nto invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the\nprotection of the country of nationality; http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html accessed 25.10.2010\nof the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees with effect from 1st March 2000.\n5. The Complainant alleges that by this agreement, Ethiopian refugees in Sudan would lose their right to\nwork or receive any social assistance as a way of coercing them into forced repatriation back to Ethiopia.\n6. The Complainant states that in February 2000, a notice was posted on the door of the UNHCR\ncompound in Khartoum, Sudan, entitled \"Information Announcement to the Ethiopian Refugees in\nSudan\"and stated in part:\nThe Government of Sudan represented by the Commission for Refugees (COR) and the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would like to inform all Ethiopian Refugees in Sudan of the\nfollowing:\nAll Ethiopian Refugees outside Ethiopia after 1st March 2000 will lose their legal refugee status. This means\nall the legal rights granted by international, regional and local regulations which guarantee refugees status\nor condition as stipulated in the 1951 Geneva convention generally governing that status and treatment of\nrefugees etc..., the legal status in respect of resolving individual cases and the right to appear before the\ncourts etc..., the right to acquire employment and the guarantees, the issue of comprehensive guidance\nand supply of shelter, health and treatment, education, food, social security, etc ...and in conclusion, the\nvarious administrative assistance, and permits like travel permits, employment permits, driving licences,\nidentity cards, residence and travel documents for travelling abroad and commercial licences etc...; all will\ncease to exist forthwith. ... In light of this new situation, any Ethiopian refugee who decides to remain in the\nSudan after 1st March 2000 will bear full responsibility of the consequences which may follow as the result\nof the forfeiture of his entitlements which he used to enjoy as a refugee before 1st March 2000. ... To avoid\nunnecessary problems, which will occur as a result of your illegal stay in the Sudan after 1st March 2000,\nwe request you to seriously consider the circumstances which will assist you in taking a reasonable\ndecision to guarantee your safety and that of the future of your family.\n7. The Complainant states that although the Government had only agreed to withdraw refugee status,\ndozens of refugees reported that the UNHCR informed them that they would be deported after 1st March\n2000 and that any benefits that they were receiving would cease. Furthermore, some of the refugees were\narrested, beaten, and further mistreated as a consequence of their protests against their involuntary\nrepatriation.\n1\n\n\f8. The Complainant states that the Respondent State, the UNHCR and the Government of Ethiopia entered\ninto an agreement to forcibly repatriate them. This action consisted of several steps, including all of the\nfollowing: the withholding of social welfare benefits such a medical attention, food, clothing, and housing\nentitlements; and the implementation of an unfair screening procedure.\n9. The Complainant states that some of the refugees who protested the removal of their refugee status\nwere sometimes arrested and deported or threatened with arrest and deportation, forcing many of them to\nflee to neighbouring countries.\n10. The Complainant further alleges that at the time, Ethiopia was involved in a full-scale international\narmed conflict with its neighbour Eritrea.\n11. The Complainant states that the UNHCR and the Respondent State agreed bi-laterally to establish a\nscreening procedure. The Complainant alleges that this procedure did not provide the basic minimum\nstandards of due process. For example, the refugees were not allowed to be legally represented; the\nGovernment of Sudan and/or the UNHCR recruited unqualified persons to do the screening. The screening\ndid not take into account the 1969 African Refugee Convention or the African Charter in their evaluation of\nindividual cases; the screenings did not start until months after the threat of forcible refoulement had been\nmade, and implemented in large parts. Interpreters were recruited from the Ethiopian Embassy in Khartoum\n- the embassy of the State from which they harboured or had a recognised, well-founded fear of\npersecution.\n12. The Complainant states that some of the refugees had lived and settled in Sudan for up to thirty years;\nthat many of them are opponents of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and\nthe Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF), ruling the country since 1991. The Complainant states that\nmany refugees feared that they would be sent to the Ethiopia/Eritrea warfront, due to the war which was\nongoing during the whole of 2000 or that they would be mistreated or even killed by the Ethiopian\nGovernment.\n13. The Complainant states that some of the refugees, such as Mr Luel Kassa, who was forced to return in\nearly 2001, were arrested upon return; and others fled Ethiopia again to Sudan or a third country as soon\nas they were able to.\n14. The Complainant states further that many of the estimated 14,000 Ethiopian refugees who are still living\nin Sudan do not wish to return to Ethiopia because they have a well-founded fear of persecution or because\nthey are fleeing the war and famine in Ethiopia.\n15. The Complainant states that in March 2001, more than 1,700 Ethiopian refugees in Port Sudan and\nKhartoum staged a hunger strike to protest their return. Their main complaint: the unfair process for\ndetermining their status.\n16. Since March 2001, the Complainant has contacted the Government of Sudan and the UNHCR in an\neffort to resolve this matter, but without success.\n17. The Complainant states that although some refugees were allowed to stay in Sudan, others remained\nwithout the consent of the Government of Sudan and feared the prospect of immediate deportation without\ndue process of law. The Complainant further alleges that many of these refugees live in inhuman conditions\nafter being denied the basic necessities of life.\n\nComplaint\n18. The Complainant alleges violations of Articles 4, 5, 6, 12(3), (4) and (5) of the African Charter on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights (African Charter).\n\nProcedure\n19. The complaint was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 22 February 2000.\n20. At the 27th Ordinary Session held from 27th April to 11th May 2000 in Algiers, Algeria, the African\nCommission decided to be seized of the communication and requested the parties to address it on the\nexhaustion of domestic remedies.\n21. The above decision was communicated to the parties on 30 June 2000.\n22. At its 28th Ordinary Session held from 23 October to 6 November 2000 in Cotonou, Benin, the African\nCommission decided to defer consideration of this communication to the 29th Ordinary Session.\n23. On 13th March 2001, the Secretariat received the Complainant's submissions on admissibility.\n2\n\n\f24. At the 29th Ordinary Session held from 23rd April to 7th May 2001 in Tripoli, Libya, the Respondent State\ninformed the African Commission that they were not aware of communications 235/00 and 236/00 submitted by Dr Curtis Doebbler against Sudan. During the Session, the Secretariat provided the\nRespondent State with copies of the said communications. The African Commission decided to defer\nconsideration of these communications to the next session.\n25. On 19th June 2001, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties of the decision of\nthe African Commission and requested the Respondent State to forward its written submissions within two\n(2) months from the date of notification of this decision.\n26. On 14th August 2001, a reminder was sent to the Respondent State to forward its submissions within\nthe prescribed time to enable the Secretariat to process the Communication.\n27. During the 30th Ordinary Session held from 13th to 27th October 2001 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nSecretariat of the African Commission received the Respondent State's written submissions in Arabic on all\npending communications against it on admissibility.\n28. During the same Session, the African Commission heard the oral submissions of the parties with\nrespect to the communication. The African Commission noted that the Respondent State had not\nresponded to the issues raised by the Complainant. The African Commission therefore decided to defer the\ncommunication to the 31st Session, pending receipt of detailed written submissions from the Respondent\nState.\n29. On 15th November 2001, the Secretariat informed the parties of the decision and requested the\nRespondent State to forward its written submissions on the issues raised by the Complainant within two (2)\nmonths from the date of notification of this decision.\n30. On 7th March 2002, a reminder was sent to the Respondent State to forward its submissions within the\nprescribed time.\n31. At its 31st Ordinary Session held from 2nd to 16th May 2002, in Pretoria, South Africa, upon the request\nof the Complainant, the African Commission decided to suspend consideration of this communication in\norder to allow the parties to pursue an amicable settlement.\n32. On 29th May 2002, the parties were informed of the decision of the African Commission.\n33. On 17th August 2002, the Complainant informed the Secretariat that he had written to the Respondent\nState with a view to negotiating an amicable settlement. However, he had not received any response from\nthe Government of Sudan.\n34. On 16th January 2003, the Secretariat received a request from the Complainant for a hearing on\nadmissibility. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt of this correspondence on 27th January 2003.\n35. The Secretariat informed both parties that the admissibility of the communication would be considered\nat the 33rd Ordinary Session.\n36. At its 33rd Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th May 2003 in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\ndeferred its decision on admissibility to allow the parties more time to send their written submissions on\nadmissibility.\n37. On 18th June 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed both parties of the\nabove-mentioned decision and requested them to forward their written submissions on admissibility within\nthree (3) months from the date of notification of this decision.\n38. On 18th September 2003, the Secretariat reminded the parties to provide the African Commission with\ntheir submissions on admissibility.\n39. By letter dated 19 September 2003, the Complainant forwarded a brief on admissibility concerning the\nexhaustion of domestic remedies.\n40. By a Note Verbale dated 30th September 2003, the Respondent State was informed that the\ncommunication would be considered at the 34th Ordinary Session. The arguments of the Complainant were\nattached to the Note Verbale.\n41. During its 34th Ordinary Session held in Banjul from 6th to 20th November 2003, the African Commission\nconsidered the Respondent State's arguments on admissibility and declared the communication\ninadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.\n42. On 4th December 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission transmitted the decision to the\nparties.\n43. On 10th February 2004, the Complainant requested the African Commission to reconsider its decision\non admissibility and requested an oral hearing at the next Ordinary Session.\n44. During the 35th Ordinary Session, the Commission considered the request to reconsider its decision on\nadmissibility, and deferred it to the 36th Ordinary Session. The Commission requested the Secretariat to\n3\n\n\finform both parties of the decision and deferred consideration of the matter to the 37th Ordinary Session.\nThe same decision was communicated to the parties. The Secretariat requested them to submit additional\narguments on admissibility. A copy of the Complainant's brief was forwarded to the Respondent State,\nwhich was duly requested to forward its response.\n45. On 25th October 2005, the African Commission informed the Complainant of its decision to grant him an\nopportunity to argue for the re-opening of the communication at its 36th Session.\n46. At the 36th Ordinary Session, the African Commission, upon consideration of the arguments put forward\nby the Complainant in his \"Brief on the Issue of Exhaustion of Domestic Remedies\", decided to reconsider\nits decision adopted during the 34th Ordinary Session, at its 37th session.\n47. On 14th March 2005 the parties were informed about the decision of the African Commission and a\ncopy of the Complainant's brief was forwarded to the Respondent State, which was duly requested to\nforward its response.\n48. During the 37th Ordinary Session held from 27th April to 11th May 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nAfrican Commission decided to defer reconsideration of the admissibility to the next session.\n49. On 28th June 2005, both the Complainant and the Respondent State were informed of the decision. The\nRespondent State was also reminded to forward its written submissions on admissibility within two (2)\nmonths from the date of notification of this decision.\n50. At the 38th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 21st November to 5th December 2005,\nthe Respondent State submitted written arguments on admissibility. The African Commission deferred\nreconsideration of the admissibility of the communication to its 39th Ordinary Session.\n51. On 16th December 2005, the Secretariat informed the parties of the decision. A copy of the Respondent\nState's arguments was sent to the Complainant.\n52. On 8th March 2006, the Secretariat received from the Respondent State a copy of the minutes of an\nAugust 2000 meeting between the Government of Sudan, the Government of Ethiopia and the UNHCR. A\ncopy of the latter documents was transmitted to the Complainant.\n53. On 23rd March 2006, the Secretariat received a response to the Respondent State's submissions of 3rd\nDecember 2005. The document was duly transmitted to the Respondent State.\n54. At the 39th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, the Gambia from 9th to 23rd May 2006, the African\nCommission reconsidered its decision on admissibility and declared that the communication was\nadmissible.\n55. By a Note Verbale of 14th July 2006, to the Secretariat informed both parties of the aforementioned\ndecision and requested them to submit their arguments on the merits within two (2) months.\n56. On 18th September 2006, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant, requesting that the\ndeadline for submission of arguments on the merits be extended by six (6) months, as the Complainant had\nbeen unable to contact the Secretariat.\n57. On 16th October 2006, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the letter from the Complainant, and\nreminded both parties to submit their arguments on the merits by the end of October 2006.\n58. On 11th April 2007, the Secretariat received the arguments on merits from the Complainant.\n59. On 25th April 2007, the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the Complainant's submissions\nand reminded the Respondent State to submit its arguments on the merits by 10th May 2007.\n60. On 20th June 2007, the Secretariat sent a Note Verbale to the Respondent State reminding the\nRespondent State that the African Commission intended to consider the communication on the merits\nduring the 42nd Ordinary Session and requested it to forward its arguments on the merits by the end of July\n2007.\n61. On 6th June 2007, the Secretariat informed the Complainant that the Respondent State had yet to\nsubmit its arguments on the Merits.\n62. By a Note Verbale of 30th October 2007, the Respondent State was reminded to submit its argumemts\non the Merits before the commencement of the 42nd Ordinary Session in Congo, Brazzaville.\n63. On 3rd November 2007, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the Respondent State that\nit had not yet received its submission on the merits.\n64. On 23rd November 2007, during the 42nd Ordinary Session, the Respondent State submitted its\narguments on the merits. The arguments were in Arabic. During the 42nd Session the African Commission\ndeferred consideration of the communication on the merits in order to allow for translation of the\nRespondent State's submissions.\n65. On 27th December 2007, the Secretariat informed the parties of its decision to defer the communication.\nIt acknowledged receipt of the State Party's brief on the merits, and also forwarded it to the Complainant.\n4\n\n\f66. At the 43rd Ordinary Session, which took place from 7th to 22nd May 2008 in Ezulwini, Swaziland, the\nAfrican Commission deferred the communication to the 44th Ordinary Session, to give the Secretariat\nenough time to prepare the draft decision on the merits.\n67. On 2nd June 20008, the parties were informed of the decision of the African Commission.\n68. During the 44th Session held in Abuja, Federal Republic of Nigeria, the African Commission considered\nthe communication and decided to defer it to the 45th session in order to finalise its decision on the merits.\n69. By letter and Note Verbale of 23rd January 2009, both the Respondent State and the Complainant were\ninformed of the decision of the Commission.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n70. The African Commission recalls that it declared the communication inadmissible during the 34th\nOrdinary Session of the Commission. The Complainant filed a request for the reopening of the case during\nthe 35th Ordinary Session. This request was considered during the 36th Ordinary Session.\n71. When declaring the communication inadmissible, the African Commission stated the following: Although\nthe parties have not provided the African Commission in writing with further written submissions on the\nissue of local remedies, the African Commission is in a position to rule on the admissibility of this\ncommunication by making reference to the written submissions of the Complainant (received on 13th March\n2001) and those of the Respondent State (received during the 30th Ordinary session) as well as the oral\nsubmissions submitted by both parties during the 33rd Ordinary Session.\n72. The Complainant alleges that there were no effective local remedies against the Government's threat to\nforcibly repatriate the Ethiopian refugees. The refugees had been denied the right to legal representation\nduring the hearings that were aimed at determining whether there was any risk if they returned to Ethiopia\nto be tortured or be subjected to inhuman, degrading and cruel treatment.\n73. The Complainant submits that the procedure for repatriation agreed to by the UNHCR and Sudan was\nunacceptable for the following reasons: firstly, the Ethiopian refugees were given no opportunity to make\nrepresentations during the decision - making process, despite public announcements to this effect.\nSecondly, most of the interpreters/translators were taken from the Ethiopian Embassy, the country from\nwhich the refugees were fleeing and they could therefore have been biased or prejudiced.\n74. The Complainant adds that the Respondent State denied visas to the legal representatives of the\nrefugees. By failing to ensure that the refugees were given a fair hearing in matters concerning their human\nrights under the African Charter, the Respondent State had by doing so denied them the right to access\nlocal effective remedies.\n75. The Respondent State argued that there had been no complaint against illegal or forced repatriation of\nEthiopians, and that this communication does not contain any concrete indication in this regard. The\nRespondent State acknowledges that it understood the situation in Ethiopia was not favourable to those\nwho feared persecution in their country of origin, but reassured the African Commission that every\nrepatriation procedure in this case followed the principle of the Convention signed between Sudan,\nEthiopia, and the UNHCR.\n76. Furthermore, the Respondent State submitted that the Complainant neither approached the UNHCR\nnor any Court or administrative body to rule on any allegations of violation committed during the process of\nrepatriation. The Complainant could have submitted an administrative application or referred the matter to\nthe competent courts available in Sudan.\n77. The Respondent State informed the African Commission that Article 20 of the 1996 Code of\nAdministrative Courts gives the Complainant the right to lodge an appeal against any administrative\ndecision. An appeal could have been lodged in the Supreme Court against any administrative decision\ntaken by the President of the Republic, the Federal Council of Ministers, the Government of any region or\nFederal or Regional Minister. The African Commission notes that the Complainant in this communication\nmakes no mention of any attempt on his part to access the available local remedies in the Respondent\nState.\n78. For the above reasons, the African Commission declares that communication inadmissible for\nnon-exhaustion of local remedies.\n\n5\n\n\fCommission's Decision on Review\n\n79. The Commission accepted the Complainant's request to reconsider its decision on the basis of the\nsubmission by the Complainant that the Commission had not addressed itself to its jurisprudence,\nregarding the exceptions to the exhaustion of local remedies rule, in particular the non-applicability of\ndomestic remedies to situations of massive violation of human rights, as is alleged in this instance.\n80. The Commission reconsidered its decision under Rule 118(2) of the African Commission's Rules of\nProcedure. Rule 118(2) reads as follows: If the Commission has declared a communication inadmissible\nunder the Charter, it may reconsider this decision at a later date if it receives a request for reconsideration.\n81. Rule 118(2) does not stipulate the conditions under which the Commission may reconsider its previous\ndecision. The Commission may exercise its discretionary powers to reconsider its decision upon a party\nmoving it, and adducing compelling reasons. The Commission is called upon at all times to protect human\nand peoples' rights. A decision to reconsider its decision must be aimed at protecting human and peoples'\nrights.\n82. Further to that general principle, a party seeking the reconsideration or review of a decision must show\nthat the Commission failed to take into account the criteria set out in Article 56 of the Charter, or it erred in\nreaching the decision it did. The review must be based on the same facts as was initially before the\nCommission. A party cannot introduce new facts or information at the review stage.\n83. The Commission has in the past, based on its jurisprudence, held that the requirement of exhaustion of\nlocal remedies does not hold \".... where it is impractical or undesirable for the Complainants or victim to\nseize the domestic courts.\"1\n84. Based on the above reasons the Commission reconsidered and departed from its previous decision\nand considered the parties' submissions on admissibility.\nDecision on admissibility\n\n85. The admissibility of the communications submitted under the African Charter is governed by Article 56\nof the African Charter. Of the seven conditions stipulated by this article, six have been met. The seventh\nwhich is Article 56(5), stipulates that:\ncommunications shall be considered if they [quote]\"are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless\nit is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged... .\n86. The Respondent State claims that the Complainant did not exhaust local remedies. It stressed that the\nComplainant had the right to lodge an appeal against any administrative decision in accordance with Article\n20 of the 1996 Code of Administrative Courts, and they could lodge an appeal to the Supreme Court\nagainst any administrative decision taken by the President of the Republic, the Federal Council of\nMinisters, the Government of any region or to the Federal or Regional Minister.\n87. The Complainant submits that the African Commission has held that \"the rule of exhausting domestic\nremedies is the most important condition for admissibility of Communications. There is no doubt therefore,\nin all communications seized by the African Commission, the first requirement considered concerns the\nexhausting of local remedies....\"2 The Complainant argues that the reason for this rule has been defined by\nthe Commission as a two-fold test. First, it is to give domestic courts an opportunity to decide upon cases\nbefore they are brought to an international forum. If a right is not well provided for at the domestic level,\nthere cannot be effective remedies at all.3\n88. Second, the Complainant states that the Respondent State should have notice of a human rights\nviolation in order to have the opportunity to remedy such violation before submitting them to an international\ntribunal.4 The Complainant submits that the Respondent State was aware of the refugees' situation for\nyears and did not act to protect them. The Complainant alleges that there can be no doubt that the\nRespondent State Government had been put on notice of the situation giving rise to this communication.\nSuch notice was given by the refugees themselves communicating with the Government; the\ncommunications of the refugees' legal representatives with the Government and coverage of the plight of\nthe refugees by the news media.\n89. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State responded to these communications by denying\nany responsibility for the plight of the refugees. The Complainant states that, because of the serious\nviolations of human rights that have occurred, the requirement that the refugees resort to domestic\nremedies should be deemed waived and the Commission should consider the merits of this\n6\n\n\fcommunication.\n90. The Complainant claims that when interpreting Article 56(5) of the Charter, the African Commission\nshould take into consideration generally recognised principles of international law in the interest of ensuring\nthe protection of human rights.5\n91. The Complainant submits that the Commission has unequivocally held that when a Respondent State\nraises the defence of non exhaustion of local remedies, it must discharge the burden by demonstrating the\nexistence of such remedies.\"6\n92. The Complainant urges the African Commission to draw inspiration from regional and international\nhuman rights mechanisms on this issue. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has repeatedly\naffirmed that a state has duties \"to organise the governmental apparatus and, in general, all the structures\nthrough which public power is exercised, so that they are capable of judicially ensuring the free and full\nenjoyment of human rights.\" 7 The Court held that \"the State claiming non-exhaustion of domestic remedies\nhas an obligation to prove that the domestic remedies remain to be exhausted and that they are effective.\"8\n93. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressly stated that the burden of proving that\neffective local remedies exist and that they had not been exhausted fell upon the government making such\na claim.9\n94. A similar view regarding the burden of proof was taken by the United Nations Human Rights Committee\nwhereby a Respondent State \"...had failed to provide.... sufficient information on effective remedies.\"10\nEqually, the European Court and Commission of Human Rights have held that the government shoulders\nthe burden of proving that there are effective remedies.\n95. Similarly, the Grand Chamber of the European Court for Human Rights has expressed the opinion that\n\"it is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion of domestic remedies to satisfy the Court that\nthe remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time.\"11 The Court\ncontinued:\" ...that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in\nrespect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success.\"12 Only once this\nburden of proof has been met does the petitioner have to establish that the local remedy \"was in fact\nexhausted or for some reason inadequate or ineffective in the particular circumstances.\"13\n96. The Complainant urges the Commission to apply the standards articulated above, which require the\nRespondent State to prove that effective local remedies exist in Sudan and that they are reasonably\naccessible. The Complainant submits further that it is evident that the Respondent State has not met this\nburden of proof. It has not shown that the refugees had adequate and effective remedies. The Government\nhad itself prevented refugees accessing any remedies - irrespective of their effectiveness and adequacy that it alleges are available.\n97. The Complainant submits that communication 235/00 involves massive and serious violations of human\nrights. He states that the African Commission has found that actions threatening the life and welfare of less\nthan a thousand people amount to serious and massive violations of human rights.14\n98. The Complainant alleges that the present communication involves more than fourteen thousand\n(14,000) Ethiopian Refugees, whose daily survival is threatened and who cannot approach the authorities\nfor fear that their refugee identity documents would be confiscated and they would be deported without the\ndue process of law.\n99. The Complainant states that the Respondent State has suggested that the refugees could have\ntheoretically relied on Administrative and Constitutional procedures in \"Article 20 of the 1996 Constitutional\nand Administrative code, and in accordance with Article 120 (2)(b) of the Constitution.\" The Complainant\nalleges that this would not have been an adequate remedy because the Judiciary in Sudan is not\nindependent.\n100. The Complainant points to the fact that the Commission noted that the Respondent State had\ndismissed over 100 judges when it came to power approximately twelve years earlier.15 The Complainant\nfurther alleges that since 1989, the appointment of Judges is done in close coordination with the President.\nThe Complainant goes on to state that the 1998 Constitution of Sudan intentionally enhanced the powers of\nthe President.16\n101. The Complainant alleges that on 12th December 1999, the President declared a State of Emergency\nand prolonged his control over the Judiciary until 2001. Cases brought to the Court challenging this\ndeclaration of emergency have been dismissed with little or no attention to international human rights law.\nInstead the Courts have relied on vague references to customary presidential powers that override the\nclear words of the Constitution.17 The Complainant concludes that the Sudanese Courts have been under\nthe control of the Sudanese Executive since 1989, and that an independent judiciary does not exist in\n7\n\n\fSudan.\n102. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State has no system in place that can protect human\nrights in the overwhelming majority of cases. He points to examples of Amal Aba al-Ajab v. Government of\nSudan case in which the Court refused to apply international human rights law.18 He also points to a similar\nsituation in the case of Abdelraham et al v. Sudan, Case No. 7/98 of 13th August 1998. 19\n103. The Complainant submits that the lack of independence of the judiciary is the result of several steps\ntaken by the Sudanese Government since it came to power in 1989. He cites the reports of Mr Leonard\nFranco, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Sudan as well as numerous\nnon-governmental organisations to demonstrate the lack of independence of the judiciary in Sudan.20\n104. The Complainant argues that although a new Constitution was adopted on 1st July 1998, the\nExecutive still exercises broad powers over the Judiciary: Section 5 of the Constitutional decree 13/1995,\nentitled 'Powers of the President' provides that ... \"the President shall be the Guardian of the Judiciary and\nthe Council of Justice in accordance with the Constitution and the Law\" , ... \"A Judge shall be guided by the\nconcept of supremacy of the Constitution, Law and general guidance of Sharia.\" Section 61 (1-3) provides\nthat: \"The Judiciary is responsible before the President for the performance of its functions effectively and\nhonestly for the prevalence of justice; its function is to adjudicate fairly in constitutional, administrative,\nfamily, civil and criminal disputes and to exercise its judgment in accordance with the law.\"\n105. The Complainant alleges that Sudan is ruled under a State of Emergency whereby the president\nexercises almost complete control over the executive, legislative and judicial functions. The Complainant\nalleges further that for the foregoing reasons, no adequate and effective remedies exist in Sudan that the\nrefugees should be required to exhaust.\n106. The Complainant submits that in the present case, the Respondent State has repeatedly denied the\nvictims access to their legal representative, Dr Curtis F. J. Doebbler, by repeatedly refusing to grant him a\nvisa to enter the country. The Government has also failed to make facilities available to the refugees, even\nwhen they are in custody, to contact their legal representative.\n107. The Complainant rejected the submission by the Respondent State that redress by way of an appeal\nto the UNHCR or an appeal to the Sudanese Courts was available to the refugees.\n108. He submitted that neither of these means of redress was adequate. An appeal to the UNHCR was\nineffective because the refugees were denied legal representation. He argues that UNHCR decision\nmakers refused to apply the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the 1969 OAU Convention\nGoverning the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa. Secondly, appeals to the Sudanese\nCourts were not possible, because there was no decision made by a Sudanese administrative body.\n109. The Complainant submitted that the Respondent State denied responsibility for the protection of\nEthiopian refugees under its jurisdiction.\n110. The Complainant stated that the Sudanese Government's position is in contrast to the position\nexpressed by the Commission, that: \"the Charter specifies in Article 1 that the State Parties shall not only\nrecognise the rights, duties and freedoms adopted by the Charter, but they should also\n\"undertake.....measures to give effect to them.\" Therefore, if a State neglects to ensure the rights in the\nAfrican Charter, this can constitute a violation, even if the State or its agents are not the immediate cause\nof the violation.21\n111. The Complainant submitted further that the process offered by the UNHCR was flawed in several\nserious matters. Despite repeated requests to represent the refugees in procedures before the UNHCR, the\nrefugees were denied the right to legal representation.\n112. The UNHCR recruited translators from the Ethiopian Embassy in Sudan to interview the\nComplainants. Because the procedures applied by UNHCR, did not apply the most basic standards of due\nprocess, it cannot be considered effective or adequate for protecting the rights of the refugees that are\nguaranteed in the African Charter.\n113. Moreover, the Complainant submitted that the right to appeal from procedures that do not meet the\nstandards of due process is illusionary and cannot be deemed an effective remedy. The refugees could not\nappeal a decision by the UNHCR to the Sudanese administrative bodies. Only administrative decisions\nmade by Sudanese Government authorities may be appealed. The Government of Sudan itself admitted\nthat it had nothing to do with the decision of the UNHCR. Consequently, there was no domestic remedy\nthat could adequately and effectively protect the victims' human rights.\n114. The Respondent State reiterated its position that the Complainant neither approached the UNHCR nor\nany court or administrative body to denounce the alleged violation of the rights of pre-1991 Ethiopian\nrefugees. The Respondent State stressed that the Complainant could have challenged the manner in which\n8\n\n\fthe repatriation exercise was carried out by lodging an appeal to the Supreme Court in accordance with\nArticle 20 of the 1996 Code of Administrative Courts. Article 20 of the Code provides that anyone can lodge\nan appeal to the Supreme Court against any administrative decision taken by the President of the Republic,\nthe Federal Council of Ministers, the Government of any region or Federal or Regional Minister.\n115. The Respondent State added that the Complainant did not cite any case of refugees who had been\nillegally or forcibly returned to Ethiopia. The Respondent State acknowledged that the situation prevailing in\nEthiopia in March 2000 was not favourable to the repatriation of those refugees fearing persecution in their\ncountry of origin. It stated however that the repatriation process followed the principles laid down in the\nTrilateral Agreement signed between the Government of Sudan, the Government of Ethiopia and the\nUNHCR in August 2000.\n116. The African Commission is of the view that, even if certain domestic remedies were available, it was\nnot reasonable to expect refugees to seize the Sudanese Courts of their complaints, given their extreme\nvulnerability and state of deprivation, their fear of being deported and their lack of adequate means to seek\nlegal representation. The Commission notes that the refugees' legal representative was repeatedly denied\nentry into the country by the Respondent State's authorities.\n117. Furthermore, even accepting the argument of the Respondent State that the refugees could have\nchallenged the decision to repatriate them before the Administrative Courts or appealed to the Supreme\nCourt, the Commission holds the view, which it has stated oftentimes before, that where the violations\ninvolve many victims, it becomes neither practical nor desirable for the Complainants or the victims to\npursue such internal remedies in every case of violation of human rights.22\nFor all these reasons, the African Commission declares this communication admissible.\nConsideration of Merits\n118. The present communication alleges that the Respondent State has violated the human rights of an\nestimated fourteen thousand Ethiopian refugees, following the invocation by the UNHCR of the Cessation\nClause under Article 1(C)(5)\n× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no\nlonger, because the circumstances in connexion with which he has been recognised as a refugee have\nceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;\nProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able\nto invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the\nprotection of the country of nationality(http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html accessed 25.10.2010)\nof the 1951 United Nations Refugees Convention.\nComplainant's submission on the Merits\n\n119. The Complainant states that sometime in September 1999, the Respondent State and the UNHCR\nconcluded an agreement, which inter alia stipulated that by 1st March 2000 Ethiopian refugees in Sudan\nwould lose their right to work or receive any social assistance as a way of coercing them into forced\nrepatriation.\n120. The Complainant states that the said refugees were subsequently repatriated involuntarily to Ethiopia,\nor were threatened with arrest or involuntary repatriation by the Respondent State upon protesting the\nrepatriation. Others were forced to leave Sudan for third countries.\n121. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State violated Articles 4, 5, 6, 12(3), (4), and (5) of the\nAfrican Charter as a result of the failure to protect the Ethiopian refugees against the involuntary\nrepatriation, and from threats of arrest. He states further that by failing to protect the refugees, it forced\nthem to live under inhumane conditions, without the basic necessities of life. The Complainant is alleging\nthat the Ethiopians are de facto refugees, and thus protected by Articles 12 of the African Charter of Human\nand Peoples' Rights.\n122. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State has an obligation to ensure respect for the right\n9\n\n\fto life, the right to humane treatment and the right to security of person for every individual under its\njurisdiction. It also has an obligation under Articles 7 of the African Charter, which requires that every\nindividual has a right to a fair determination of his human rights as protected in the Charter.\n123. The Complainant draws the attention of the African Commission to Articles 60 of the Charter, to draw\ninspiration from the UN Convention on Refugees of 195123 and the 1969 OAU Convention Governing the\nSpecific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, instruments which the Respondent State has signed and\nratified24 when determining the meaning of the above articles in the Charter in relation to those instruments.\n124. The Complainant argues that since the African Charter is a treaty that is later in time, than either the\nUN Refugees Convention, or the African refugees convention, the general principle of international law to\nbe applied to resolve any conflict between treaties is that the latter treaty prevails over the former treaty that\nare not compatible. The Complainant relies on Article 30(3)\n× When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not\nterminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its\nprovisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.\nof the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 25 which states that \"the earlier treaty applies only to the\nextent that its provisions are compatible with those of the latter treaty.\" He argues that by applying this\nprinciple, any provisions of the UN refugees convention that are incompatible with either the African\nrefugee convention or the Charter must be deemed to be overridden by these latter two instruments.\n125. The Commission wishes to state that it does not find any conflict or incompatibility between the African\nCharter and the two refugees' convention, or between the UN and the OAU refugees conventions. The\n1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa 1969 OAU\nConvention stipulates that it is a complement to the 1951 UN Refugees Convention. Paragraph 9 of its\npreamble recognises the 1951 UN Convention and the 1967 Protocol as the basic and universal\ninstruments relating to the status of refugees. Article VIII of the OAU Convention enjoins Member States to\ncooperate with the UNHCR, and states further that the OAU Convention is a regional complement to the\n1951 UN Convention.\n126. In that respect the Commission shall read the provisions of the three instruments as complementing\neach other. The Complainant's argument that the provisions of the latter convention prevail over the former\ndo not in any way affect the interpretation the Commission will give to the applicable provisions, should it be\nnecessary to do so under this communication. This is because the provisions are at most complementary to\neach other and not mutually exclusive.\n127. Concerning the said violations, the Complainant submits that the Respondent State did not deny the\nfacts as presented; rather it has merely alleged that the problem is the responsibility of the UNHCR. He\nstates that both the Government of Sudan and the UNHCR recognised all of the refugees in the 1990s. The\nComplainant states that while the Respondent State claims that the refugees no longer need protection, the\nrefugees, nevertheless, refute this claim. He argues that the refugees still deserve protection and, at the\nvery least, they deserve a fair process to determine this question in each of their individual cases. He\nargues that since the Respondent State has denied the refugees protection, and a fair determination\nprocess, it is necessary to examine the de jure status individually.\n128. The Complainant argues that both customary international law and the African Charter provide special\nprotection to individuals who are unable to seek the protection of their own country. These persons refugees and asylum seekers - are recognised as being in particularly vulnerable positions. States are\nunder a legal obligation to consider refugees' claims to protection through a fair procedure and to provide\nthem protection if their claims are found to be well-founded.\n129. Referring the Commission to Articles 12 of the African Charter, the Complainant argues that the\nCharter specifically recognises the need to protect such individuals, notwithstanding that it does not define\nin detail who qualifies as a refugee, except to describe them as any person who is persecuted. He goes on\nto state that the second preambular paragraph\n× Considering that the African Charter, while guaranteeing the freedom of movement and freedom of\nresidence of every individual within a state subject to being law abiding, recognises that when persecuted,\nevery individual shall have the right to seek and obtain asylum in other countries in accordance with the\nrespective laws of the said countries, and international law,\nof Resolution No. 72/(XXXVI)/04, creating the Commission's Special Rapporteur, reiterates this protection,\nwhile also drawing States' attention to their obligations under relevant international instruments. 26\n\n10\n\n\f130. The Complainant further argues that the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is lex specialis\nin relation to the African Charter.27\n131. He argues that the Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa is lex\nspecialis to both the Charter and the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. He states that this\ninstrument elaborates and strengthens the definition of a refugee deserving the protection of asylum. This\ntreaty, he maintains, extends the definition of a refugee by stating in paragraph 2 of Article 1 that not only is\na refugee a person as described by the UN Refugees Convention, but also that:\n[t]he term \"refugee\" shall also apply to every person who, owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign\ndomination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or\nnationality, is compelled to leave his place of habitual residence in order to seek refuge in another place\noutside his country of origin or nationality.\n132. The Complainant concludes that, in the instance case, this expanded definition applies to the\nEthiopian refugees in addition to the definition in the UN Refugee Convention. This expanded definition\nmust also be the basis of the interpretation and implementation of Article 12 by the Commission because it\nprovides individuals cumulatively the most adequate protection of their human rights in accordance with the\ninternational legal obligations that the Government of Sudan has voluntarily undertaken.\nRespondent State's Submission on the Merits\n\n133. The Respondent State in its submission states that Sudan is always committed to the implementation\nof international human rights instruments and continues to cooperate with the UN High Commission for\nRefugees which has the responsibility of monitoring international and regional conventions on refugees.\n134. The Respondent State denies all the Complainant's allegations. It argues that as a signatory to the\nAfrican Charter and various refugee instruments, it was merely cooperating with the UNHCR \"...in\nperforming its functions, and assist it in facilitating its duties and carrying out its assignments to monitor and\nimplement the provisions\" of the Geneva Convention.28 The Respondent State argues that refugees are\nonly entitled to receive support from the UN, where fear from persecution which caused him/her to flee, still\npersists.\n135. The Respondent State argues that following the fall of Mengistu's regime in 1991, the UNHCR was of\nthe view that the circumstances which led to the flight of Ethiopians to Sudan and to the other countries of\nthe world, no longer existed. The Respondent State states that the UNHCR believed that the situation in\nEthiopia after Mengistu's fall had sufficiently changed for the return of large numbers of refugees to that\ncountry. It nevertheless argues that the announcement of the Termination of Refugee Status for Ethiopian\nrefugees was not supposed to take place before an adequate period of time elapsed, to ensure stability and\nsustainability of the change in the country of origin.\n136. The Respondent State, quoting Article 1(c) para. 1-6\n× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: 1) He has\nvoluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; or 2) Having lost his\nnationality, he has voluntarily re-acquired it, or 3) He has acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the\nprotection of the country of his new nationality; or 4) He has voluntarily re-established himself in the country\nwhich he left or outside which he remained owing to fear of persecution; or 5) He can no longer, because\nthe circumstances in connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist,\ncontinue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; Provided that this\nparagraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able to invoke\ncompelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the\ncountry of nationality; 6) Being a person who has no nationality he is, because of the circumstances in\nconnection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, able to return to the\ncountry of his former habitual residence;\nof the 1951 UN Refugees Convention, which defines the six conditions under which refugee status ceases,\nargues that in the case of the Ethiopian refugees, the conditions no longer justified their continued stay in\nSudan. The Respondent State argues that these six conditions are based on the consideration that\ninternational protection is not usually granted when it is not justified.\n137. It cites the Cessation Clause, Article 1(C)(5)\n× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no\nlonger, because the circumstances in connection with which he has been recognised as a refugee have\n11\n\n\fceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;\nProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able\nto invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the\nprotection of the country of nationality;\nas the source of the current dispute, which was not only directed at the Ethiopian refugees in Sudan, but to\nEthiopian refugees elsewhere in the world. The Respondent State argues that indeed the UNHCR had\nissued similar Cessation Clauses in the past for other refugees from Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique,\nNamibia, South Africa and Chile, when the situation in those countries normalised. The Respondent State\nsubmitted that since Sudan hosts a large number of Ethiopian refugees, to avoid the consequences which\na hasty implementation would cause to the refugees and to the Sudanese as well, it requested the Third\nCommittee of the United Nations in New York for a gradual implementation of the Cessation Clause to the\nEthiopian refugees in the Sudan.\n138. The Respondent State states that a Tripartite Agreement between Sudan, Ethiopia and the UNHCR\nwas executed in 1993. Under this Agreement a programme of voluntary repatriation began to be\nimplemented in 1993 and continued into 1998. The Respondent State submits further that, according to this\nAgreement, 720,000 refugees returned voluntarily. However, at the end of the programme, a considerable\nnumber of the refugees remained in the Sudan.\n139. The Respondent State stated that, both Ethiopia and Sudan requested the UNHCR on 29th December\n1999 and 1st February 2000 respectively for a postponement of the repatriation due to the outbreak of the\nwar with Eritrea. The Respondent State, Ethiopia and the UNHCR later concluded another Tripartite\nAgreement on 25th August 2000 to repatriate refugees at the end of the war with Eritrea, and the end of the\nrainy season.\n140. The August 2000 agreement provided, inter alia, for transport modalities, provision of return packages\nfor the returnees, such as cups, blankets, food allowances and other non food items. It also established a\nmechanism for a residual caseload of individuals with compelling reasons for international protection, and\nthose who for social and economic reasons wished to remain in Sudan.\n141. A screening process was carried out jointly by the Sudanese Commission on Refugees and the\nUNHCR to determine those who continued to need international protection. It was agreed that the\nregularisation for those wishing to remain in Sudan was a matter for bilateral discussion between the two\ngovernments. The screening process was envisaged to end in November 2000. Repatriation would be\nconducted between 1st and 31st December 2000, since food and funding would not be available in 2001.\nThe implementation for repatriation was delayed to a later date (14th March 2001) to allow for proper\nimplementation and assessment.\n142. The Respondent State argues that the UNHCR brought in the best cadres serving in different parts of\nthe world to take part in this exercise, so as to ensure equity and justice. The Respondent State submits\nthat the repatriation was voluntary. It denies that any refugees were imprisoned, tortured or were subjected\nto involuntary return. It submits further that no person was denied social services, such as medical care,\nfood or shelter. Assistance was extended to refugees throughout up to their final place of residence. Those\nremaining were assisted until all phases of the implementation of the cessation clause were exhausted,\nincluding the reconciliation of their legal status.\n143. The Respondent State submitted further that of those who did not opt for voluntary repatriation, 282\nwere granted protection, while 2753 were not. The determination was done in accordance with the 1977\nUNHCR Executive Committee (EXCOM) decision, which requires Member States to adopt comprehensive\nprocedures to ensure that asylum seekers are given adequate time to make an appeal for reconsideration\nof a decision to accredit them, to the same committee or another authority.\n144. By June 2001, the Respondent State had registered 7,072 Ethiopians from both the 1993 to 1998, and\nthe 2000 repatriation phases and issued them with an annually renewable residence permits, pursuant to\nUNHCR Executive Committee (EXCOM) decision No 69, which requires Member States implementing the\ncessation clause to make appropriate arrangements to enable persons expected to leave the country to\ntake care of strong family and other social and economic engagements.\n145. The Respondent State drew that attention of the Commission to the date the communication was\nreceived at the Commission's Secretariat on the 22nd February 2000. It submitted that the Communication\nwas received prior to the date of the implementation of the Cessation clause. The Respondent State\nsubmitted that \"10,000 Ethiopian refugees actually returned to their country voluntarily in the wake of the\nimplementation of the clause... .\" It argues that such returnees cannot be deemed to be included in the\ncommunication.\n12\n\n\fCommission's Decision on Merits\n\n146. The present communication turns on issues relating to the application of two important principles in\ninternational refugee and human rights law. The first issue is the effect of the Cessation Clause and its\napplication under the 1951 United Nations Convention on Status of Refugees vis-a-vis a State Party to the\nAfrican Charter. The second issue is the applicability of the non-refoulement principle based on the actions\ntaken by the Respondent State as a consequence of the Cessation Clause. The African Commission is\ntherefore required to determine whether or not the Respondent State, in applying the Cessation Clause,\nacted in a manner which amounted to the refoulement of refugees to their country of origin where they\nfeared persecution, and hence constituting a violation of the African Charter.\n147. Before analysing the instant case, it is important to clarify these concepts, namely the \"cessation\nclause,\" \"refoulement\"and \"non-refoulement.\"\n148. Article 1(C)(5)\n× This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: He can no\nlonger, because the circumstances in connexion with which he has been recognised as a refugee have\nceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;\nProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A(1) of this article who is able\nto invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the\nprotection of the country of nationality;\nof the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees stipulates one of the six conditions which brings to\nan end the refugee status and hence the protection hitherto enjoyed by a refugee during asylum in a host\ncountry, after fleeing persecution or the fear of persecution in his/her home country. Article 1(C)(5) of the\n1951 UN Refugees Convention reads as follows:\n[t]his Convention shall cease to apply to any person, (i.e. a refugee) if [h]e can no longer, because the\ncircumstances in connexion with which he has been recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist,\ncontinue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;\nProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee ...who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising\nout of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the country of nationality.\n149. The 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa\nstipulates a cessation clause of its own. Article 1(4)(e) reads as follows: [t]his Convention shall cease to\napply to any refugee if (s)he can no longer, because of the circumstances in connection with which he was\nrecognized as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the\ncountry of his nationality.\nAccording to the two conventions the status of a refugee ceases when circumstances which caused the\nperson to assume refugee status cease to exist. Such a person can no longer refuse the protection of his or\nher country. International protection is granted to refugees because they do not enjoy the protection of their\nown home countries. The Cessation Clause does not apply when compelling reasons arising out of\nprevious persecution force a person to refuse the protection of ones country.\n150. \"Non-refoulement\", on the other hand, is a principle which has taken an increasingly fundamental\ncharacter, as one of the cornerstones of international refugee law. It prohibits the return of an individual to a\ncountry in which he or she may be persecuted.29 This principle is set out in the 1951 UN Refugee\nConvention, Article 33 (1)] which states that: \"No Contracting State shall expel or return (\"refouler\") a\nrefugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be\nthreatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or\npolitical opinion.\"30\n151. The 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of the Refugee Problem in Africa31\nenshrines the principle of non-refoulement in Article 2(3) of this Convention. It reads as follows: \"[n]o\nperson shall be subjected by a Member State to measures such as rejection at the frontier, return or\nexpulsion, which would compel him to return to or remain in a territory where his life, physical integrity or\nliberty[/quote] would be threatened for the reasons set out in paragraphs 1 and 2.\"\n152. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 1 of the OAU Convention define the conditions which compel an\nindividual to flee the country of his habitual residence and seek asylum in another country.\n153. Having seen the applicable provisions, it is incumbent upon the Commission to determine whether the\n13\n\n\fRespondent State violated the African Charter.\n154. The Complainant submitted that the Respondent State denied 14,000 Ethiopian refugees the\nprotection they deserved and a fair determination process when it executed a joint agreement with the\nUNHCR in September 1999, giving effect to the cessation clause by 1st March 2000.\n155. Did the actions of the Respondent State, in executing the joint agreement in September 1999 and\nposting the notice in February 2000, amount to committing a refoulement, i.e. the act of expelling the\nrefugees? The mere execution of the agreement and posting of the notice did not constitute an act\namounting to an expulsion or repatriation. The September 1999 and the subsequent notice clearly\nexpressed the intent to apply the Cessation Clause. They created an atmosphere which triggered this\ncommunication even before the Cessation Clause implementation was set in motion. The repatriation\nprocess under the refugee conventions is conducted in a voluntary manner.\n156. The Respondent State, being a party to the September 1999 agreement was thus responsible for\nwhatever action that would follow the execution of the said agreement. The Respondent State cannot\nblame the UNHCR for its own actions. The Respondent State has however stated that it did not refoule the\nrefugees. It has submitted that it did not forcibly repatriate them; it did not imprison them nor deny them the\nbasic necessities of life as alleged by the Complainant.\n157. The Respondent State denied that it repatriated refugees during the Eritrean-Ethiopian conflict. In fact\nit submitted that both Ethiopia and itself requested the UNHCR to postpone the repatriation during the\nEthiopian Eritrean War. Repatriation resumed after the end of the conflict when a tripartite agreement was\nconcluded in August 2000. The agreement provided for voluntary repatriation, inclusive of UNHCR\nassistance to the returnees as well as modalities for determination of a caseload of refugees who did not\nopt to be repatriated.\n158. The Respondent State stated that the refugees were not denied assistance, in spite of the notice, till\nthe end of the repatriation programme. 282 refugees continued receiving protection after the cessation\nclause.\n159. The Complainant alleged that the Respondent State had mistreated the refugees for protesting their\nforcible repatriation. He alleged that the refugees were beaten, arrested, forcefully repatriated, and in other\ncases were threatened with forced repatriation for demanding to remain in Sudan for fear of persecution if\nthey were returned to Ethiopia.\n160. The African Commission wishes to state that the accounts by the two parties about the events\nsubsequent to the Cessation Clause differ in certain respects. The Complainant, who claimed to represent\n14,000 refugees, submitted that many of the refugees did not want to return to Ethiopia because they were\naligned to the opposition EPRP and feared persecution. The Respondent State submitted that most of the\npre-1991 refugees returned. A substantial number were granted further protection and others were issued\nwith residence permits due to family or socio-economic reasons. The Respondent State argues that by\nJune 2001 it had issued residence permits to more than 7000 refugees who did not opt to be repatriated. At\nthe same time it stated that other post 1991 refugees who had fled the current Ethiopian regime continued\nto remain in Sudan.\n161. The African Commission has not found any substantive reasons to doubt the account by the\nRespondent State. The African Commission holds that thousands of refugees repatriated voluntarily under\nthe tripartite arrangements and those who remained were accorded refugee status or assumed normal\nimmigrant status upon being granted residence permits.\n162. The African Commission states, however, that the allegations made by the Complainant could have\nbeen a case of a few refugees who feared the worst during the time immediately after the Cessation Clause\nwas announced. The fear of the unknown by a substantial number of refugees who were able to\ncommunicate with their lawyer as well as the publicity generated by press reports, coupled with the\nfrustrations of denial of visas by the Respondent State to the Complainant, compounded the perception that\nthe Respondent State was about to refoule the refugees.\n163. The Commission has found no evidence that refugees were refouled as a result of the cessation\nclause. The Commission has not established any cases of imprisonment, arrest, and forcible repatriation.\nThere was no concrete evidence brought to the attention of the Commission to the effect that such cases, if\nany, were linked to the promulgation and implementation of the cessation clause. The Respondent State\ndemonstrated by providing figures, which were not refuted, of refugees who repatriated voluntarily prior to\nand after the cessation clause, as well as those who were granted further protection or alternative solutions\nto repatriation. The Complainant allegations that Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the African Charter were violated\nhave not been proved.\n14\n\n\f164. The Complainant argues that Article 7 of the African Charter requires that every individual has a right\nto a fair determination of the human rights protected in the Charter.\n165. The Respondent State denied that it violated Article 7 of the African Charter. It argued that there is no\nuniform process for determination of refugee status and appeals under the international refugee regime. It\nstated that it had established a joint determination mechanism involving the Sudanese Commission of\nRefugees and the UNHCR to carry out determination for the refugees who did not opt for voluntary\nrepatriation under EXCOM decision No 69. The Commission, while reiterating the need to adopt judicial\nremedies in the event of the failure of such administrative mechanisms, takes note of the EXCOM\nstipulated mechanism for the reconsideration of decisions by the same committee or another authority, in\nthe event of dissatisfaction with a decision of the Joint Committee.\n166. The Commission wishes to state that the Complainant raised issues which, in actual fact, had been\ntaken care of. The Communication appears to have been instituted before the implementation of the\nCessation Clause began. Hence when implementation began, the alleged violation of the refugees' rights\nexpressed by the Complainant was eventually taken care of by the Respondent State.\n167. The Complainant submitted that the refugees continued to consider themselves as de facto refugees\npost-the cessation clause based on paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of Article 12 of the African Charter:\n(3) Every individual shall have the right, when persecuted, to seek and obtain asylum in other countries in\naccordance with the law of those countries and international conventions. (4) A non-national legally\nadmitted in a territory of a State Party to the present Charter, may only be expelled from it by virtue of a\ndecision taken in accordance with the law. (5) The mass expulsion of non-nationals shall be prohibited.\nMass expulsion shall be that which is aimed at national, racial, ethnic or religious groups.\nGoing by the aforesaid submission, the Commission finds that based on the information before it, there\nwere only cases of refugees who repatriated voluntarily, or those who remained within the Respondent\nState under various recognised legal status, namely those who retained their status or those who became\nimmigrants upon the grant of residence permits, and the post-1991 refugees who were, in any case, not the\nsubject of the Communication. The Commission, therefore, finds that there was at no time any case of de\nfacto refugees.\nThe Commission finds that the Communication was filed in anticipation of a violation, which did not happen\nin actual fact after the implementation of the cessation clause set in motion.\n168. The Complainant's allegation that Article 12 of the African Charter was violated has also not been\nproved.\n\nDecision of the African Commission\n\nThe African Commission finds that the allegations concerning violations of Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12(3), (4)\nand (5) of the African Charter have not been proved.\nDone in Banjul, The Gambia at the 46th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and\nPeoples' Rights held from 11th-25th November 2009.\n\nFootnotes\n1 See Amnesty International, et al. vs Sudan, Consolidated comm. 48/90, [50/91], 52/91 and 89/93, 27th\nOrdinary Session, 10th Activity Report (2000).\n2 228/99-The Law Office of Ghazi Suleiman/ Sudan, 33rd Ordinary Session, Sixteenth Annual Activity\nReport (2003) at para. 29.\n3 communication155/96-Social and Economic Rights Action Group and Centre for Economic and Social\nRights/ Nigeria, Fifteenth Annual Activity Report (2003) para 37.\n4 Ibid. at para 38.\n5 See Article 60 of the African Charter.\n6 Rencontre africaine pour la défense des droits de l'Homme v.

The communication is submitted by a Complainant who requests anonymity and presents the facts of the\ncase as follows:\n2. The Complainant alleges that on 30th September 2003, the Anti-Corruption Committee presented a\nreport on corruption in the judiciary to the Chief Justice of Kenya in the presence of the press. The Report\nalso known as the Ringera Report reveals shocking and endemic corruption in the judiciary and further lists\nthe names of the judges alleged to have been involved in corrupt and unethical practices in the course of\nperforming their duties.\n3. On 4th October 2003 during a press conference, the Chief Justice without naming the judges is alleged to\nhave given the said judges a two-week ultimatum to resign or face trial. Two days later, the Constitutional\nAffairs Assistant Minister is reported to have reiterated the deadline issued by the Chief Justice and warned\nthat judges who ignore the deadline would face tribunals and prosecution for crimes committed.\n4. The Complainant states that the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association was quoted in the press as\nsaying \"we urge the judicial administration to inform those affected so that they can decide on their next\ncourse of action not forgetting the need for confidentiality\" However, the Complainant claims that over the\nfollowing several days none of the judges named in the report were informed of their presence on the list\nnor of the allegations leveled against them.\n5. The Complainant avers that on 14th October 2003 it was reported through a six o'clock news broadcast\nthat the President had appointed two tribunals to investigate the twenty-three (23) judges whose names\nwere announced during the broadcast as well as their suspension. The Complainant asserts that this is the\nfirst time that the judges learnt of their presence on the list and of their immediate suspension. The\nannouncement however did not contain details of the allegations made against each judge. It is however\nreported in the Daily Nation Newspaper on 18th October 2003 that the police would question some of the\njudges before they appear before the tribunals and it is only during those interrogations they will be\ninformed of the accusations against them and their statements taken.\n6. The Complainant alleges that as of 17th October 2003, the judges had still not received details of the\nallegations made against them despite continued press coverage of the matter. Although maintaining their\ninnocence, some of the named judges tendered their resignations or sought retirement.\n7. The Complainant further submits that the Chair of the Law Society of Kenya on 18th October 2003\nannounced through the press that the Society would in two weeks' time release its report containing a list of\njudges other than those named in the Ringer[a] Report.\n8. The Complainant on the whole submits that failure to advise the judges mentioned in the Ringera Report\nof the allegations against them and to give them an opportunity to accept or dispute the allegations coupled\nwith varied threats and warnings amounts to harassment and hounding of judges thereby undermining the\nprinciples of security of tenure and the independence of the judiciary.\n9. Furthermore, the Complainant claims that the manner in which the whole matter was dealt with violates\nArticles 7 and 26 of the African Charter as well as other international human rights instruments namely the\nUN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights and the International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights.\n\nComplaint\n10. The Complainant alleges a violation of 7 and 26 of the African Charter.\n\nProcedure\n11. The communication was faxed and received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 21st\nOctober 2003. The Complainant also requested the African Commission to take provisional Measures\nunder Rule 111 of the Rules of the African Commission to ensure that the process of removal of judges\ndoes not interfere with independence of the judiciary and the right to a fair hearing.\n12. The Secretariat of the African Commission on 24th October 2003 forwarded a copy of the\ncommunication as well as a draft Appeal Letter to the Chair of the African Commission and requested him\n1\n\n\fto take necessary action.\n13. By email dated 28th October 2003, the Chair of the African Commission wrote advising the Secretariat\nthat since the matter would be handled as a communication at the African Commission's forthcoming 34th\nSession, an Appeal Letter should not be sent to the government of Kenya until after the African\nCommission had examined the matter and determined what course of action to take.\n14. On 31st October 2003, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to the Complainant\nacknowledging receipt of the communication.\n15. At its 34th Ordinary Session held from 6th to 20th November 2003 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission examined the communication and decided to be seized of the matter.\n16. On 4th December 2003, the parties to the communication were informed accordingly and requested to\nforward their written submissions on admissibility of the communication within 3 months.\n17. On 15th March 2004, the parties to the communication were reminded to forward their written\nsubmissions on admissibility to the Secretariat.\n18. By email dated 16th March 2004, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant withdrawing the\nmatter as she believed that the matter was now being addressed by the Respondent State.\n19. On 25th March 2004, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submissions on admissibility and\nacknowledged receipt of the same on 26th March 2004.\n20. By letter dated 26th March 2004, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Complainant's letter\nwithdrawing the communication and also forwarded a copy of the Respondent State's submissions on\nadmissibility.\n21. At its 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the African Commission considered this\ncommunication and decided to close the file.\nRespondent State's submissions on admissibility\n\n22. The Respondent State provides a background against which it undertook the judicial reforms which\nhave in part given rise to this communication. They argue that a well functioning judicial system is crucial to\nimproving governance, combating corruption and consolidating the democratic order, thereby fostering\neconomically sustainable development. Therefore, a judicial system with integrity should be free from\npolitical and external interference. Furthermore, judicial independence must be balanced by accountability\nin order to facilitate transparency within the system and control of corruption.\n23. It is submitted by the Respondent State that the tendency towards corruption and abuse of power\namong certain members of the judiciary in Kenya has been lamented over time. As such, one of the key\nobjectives of the Kenyan government has been to undertake judicial reform in order to develop an impartial,\nindependent, accountable and effective judiciary that is able to improve governance and advance\ndevelopment in the country.\n24. The Respondent State contends that the communication does not meet the requirements in Articles\n56(2), (4) and (5) of the African Charter.\n25. It is submitted that the communication is substantially based on newspaper reports and is therefore not\nfounded on factual realities of the case contrary to Article 56(4) of the African Charter.\n26. The Respondent State further submits that the Complainant did not even attempt to exhaust local\nremedies in their case as required by Article 56(5) of the African Charter. In this regard, the Respondent\nState argues that the national legal framework in Kenya is adequate to address the concerns raised by the\nComplainant and should have therefore been utilised. For instance, the concerns raised by the\nComplainant could have been addressed through, the constitutional provisions or national statutes like the\nPublic Officer Ethics Act 2003, the Anti Corruption and Economic Crimes Act 2003. Furthermore, local\njudicial action and remedy is available to the judges, should any of the procedures adopted be deemed\nillegal or in any case ultra vires.\n27. The Respondent State reports that the judges are not on trial as understood but that special\ninvestigative tribunals were set up to determine issues touching upon the behaviour and ability of the\njudges implicated to perform the functions of their office. [Twenty-three] (23) judges from both the Court of\nAppeal and High Court of Kenya were involved and were investigated within 14 days of the presentation of\nthe Ringera Report. The Tribunals started sitting on 9th and 16th February 2004.\n28. Confidentiality was assured for the affected judges in the initial stages and at all crucial times. Only\nbroad categories of alleged offences were highlighted in the media. The Respondent State argues that it\nwas therefore possible for a judge to privately and conscientiously place him/herself into any of the\n2\n\n\fcategories and make a personal decision to resign or appear before the tribunals. Consequently, [the]\nmajority of the judges mentioned opted for early retirement with full benefits as a result.\n29. In any case, the Respondent State argues, that the judges had the option within the laws to challenge\nthe process before the High Court should they be aggrieved by it but none of the said judges opted for the\njudicial remedy.\n30. The Respondent State maintains that the domestic legislation of Kenya is in consonance with both the\nletter and spirit of international law including the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary\nand asks the African Commission to declare the communication inadmissible.\nReasons given by the Complainant for withdrawing the communication\n\n31. The Complainant wrote to inform the African Commission that they received information that the\nRegistrar and Chief Justice did not authorise the leaking of the names of the implicated judges to the press\nand that this particular matter was now being investigated by the Judiciary. Furthermore, the issue of a fair\ntrial in light of the publicity created prior to the suspension of the judges had been raised before the\ntribunals and that the matter was being handled and could end up with the constitutional court of Kenya\n[sic].\n32. It is for this reason that the Complainant wishes to withdraw the communication.\n\nHolding\n\nThe African Commission takes note of the withdrawal of the communication by the Complainant\nand for this reason decides to close the file.\nDone at the 35th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 21st May to 4th June 2004.\n\n3\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"23","date":"June 4, 2004","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"Corruption and fraud, Independence of the judiciary, Right to fair trial","activity_report":"17th Activity Report: 2003 - 2004","outcome":"20"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080c3fb8","title":"Dino Noca vs Democratic Republic of the Congo","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559456204,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"286_04 Communication 286 _2004 - Dino Noca vs Democratic Republic of the Congo.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463559457212945agofi2e53ik9.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463559457212945agofi2e53ik9.pdf","size":91974},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"286/04 Communication 286 /2004 - Dino Noca vs\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\nSummary of the Facts\n1. The complaint was brought before the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights (the\nCommission) on 6 December, 2004 against the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the DRC) or the\nRespondent State 1 by Mr. Dino Noca represented by Mr. NYABIRUNGU Mwene Songa, a Lawyer at the\nBar of Kinshasa (the Complainant); then by Mr. FAKATI wa LUHINDI Défi Augustin, a Lawyer at the same\nBar who later continued with the proceedings.\n2. The Complainant presents a dispute concerning a building located in the District of Ibanda and\nregistered in the cadastral plan of the city of Bukavu, South Kivu Province, under number 17 R/2 2 , which\ndispute was ruled on by Judgment No. RCR/C019, on 28 November 2003 by the Supreme Court of Justice\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n3. The Complainant alleges that the building is the property of the late Lucio NOCA, of Italian nationality,\ndeceased on 27 May 1992, at Sordevolo, a demise which occurred in the course of the hearing.\n4. He further emphasizes the fact that the complainants' rights to the building were covered by the\nRegistration Certificate vol. F.XXX, folio 23, which constituted a title deed under the legislation of the\nRepublic of Zaire, now the DRC.\n5. The Complainant alleges that later on the State adopted Ordinance No. 74-152 of 2 July 1974 relating to\nabandoned or undeveloped properties and other assets acquired by the State under the law. Properties\ncovered by this law were ceded to Congolese nationals and the relevant title deeds were nullified without\nintervention by any court.\n6. The Complainant alleges that to circumvent the application of the said law, the late Lucio NOCA\nentrusted the management of his building to the State-owned National Insurance Company (SONAS) which\nhad the competence to manage real estates belonging to non-resident expatriates.\n7. The Complainant alleges that in spite of this state of affairs, the building was declared abandoned and\nallocated in turn to persons by name Matakina and Kafwa Kasongo respectively. As Mr. Matakina had not\nsatisfied the required conditions for the aforementioned property to be allocated to him, it was instead\nallocated to Mr. Kafwa Kasongo, the then State Prosecutor at the Bukavu High Court, whose claim was\ndeemed to be valid.\n8. The Complainant further submits that the withdrawal of the building from the estate of Noca also followed\nOrder No. 1440/000152/80 of 3 September 1980, which had wrongly classified the building as abandoned\nproperty. 3\n9. The Complainant alleges that following an appeal made by SONAS to the competent authority against\nthis ruling declaring it abandoned property, the latter won the case by Order No. 1440/000207/82 of 20\nSeptember 1982, ceding back the building in question.4\n10. The Complainant claims that the appeal filed by SONAS was initially ignored by the Head of Lands\nDepartment in Bukavu City who requested that the document in his possession be authenticated. This was\ndone by a telephone message No. 00027/84 dated 5th July 1984. The same message was confirmed by\nletter No. 1.440/000748 of the same date from the Minister of Lands, who was then State Commissioner, to\nrepeal Order no 1.440/000152/80.\n11. The Complainant points out that without waiting for the authentication of the document, the Head of the\nLands Department issued a registration certificate to Mr. Kafwa Kasongo on 9 June 1984 in defiance of the\norder; whereas the Judgement on the declaration of buildings as abandoned property of 3 September 1980\nand Order no.74-152/74 of 2 Jul 1974 had been repealed one after the other on 20 September 1982 and 2\nFebruary 1984 by Judgement No. 1440/000207/82 and Order No. 84-026/84 respectively.\n12. The Complainant further alleges that copies of the aforementioned documents were produced and\ncopied at the same time to the Head of the Regional Department of Lands, the Curator of Title Deeds and\nthe Governor's Office in Kivu Province.\n13. The Complainant therefore concludes that the Head of the Regional Department of Lands had acted\nknowingly and intentionally refused to wait for the reaction of his superior.\n14. The Complainant asserts that following the issuance of the registration certificate to Mr. Kafwa, the\nState Counsel for South Kivu was invited by the Ministries of Justice and Lands to file for an annulment of\n1\n\n\fthe title deed wrongfully allocated to Mr. Kafwa.\n\nThe Complaint\n15. The Complainant submits that in the light of the above mentioned facts, the Respondent State has\nviolated Articles 3, 7 and 14 of the African Charter.\n16. The Complainant further requests the Commission to:\n• Declare judgement No. RCR/C019 of 28th November 2003 null and void following the requested\ndisqualification of the right of Mr. KAFWA to the disputed property; recognise the right of Mr. NOCA\nLucio, and, by extension, his sole heir, Mr. Dino NOCA to the said property.\n• Award to Mr. Dino NOCA as compensation for occupation and deprivation of use of property for 28\nyears a minimum amount of USD 400,000, including legal fees.\n\nThe Procedure\n17. The Complaint was submitted on 12 February 2004 to the Secretariat of the Commission, which\nacknowledged receipt of it the same day.\n18. At its 35th Ordinary Session held from 21 May to 4 June 2004 in Banjul, The Gambia, the Commission\ndecided to be seized of the Communication and requested that the interested Parties be informed. The\nSecretariat informed the Parties of the Commission's decision and requested them to submit their written\narguments on admissibility.\n19. The Complainant submitted its written arguments on the admissibility of the Communication to the\nSecretariat of the Commission during the deliberations of the 35th Ordinary Session. The Secretariat\nsubmitted a copy of the complaint and the arguments of the Complainant to representatives of the\nRespondent State present at this Session.\n20. By an additional submission on the admissibility of the Communication forwarded on 6 December 2004,\nthe Complainant informed the Secretariat of the Commission about the replacement of Mr. NYABIRUNGU\nMwene SONGA by Mr. FATAKI wa LUHINDI D®fi Augustin, a Lawyer at the Bar of Kinshasa/Gombe to\npursue his interests at the Commission.\n21. The Commission considered the Communication at its 36th, 37th, 38th, 39th, 40th, 41st 42nd and 43th\nOrdinary Sessions and at every session deferred its decision for lack of arguments from the Respondent\nState on admissibility.\n22. The Secretariat informed the parties to the Communication of the Commission's decision by requesting\nat each time that the Respondent State should submit its written observations on the admissibility of the\nCommunication.\n23. A Note verbale as a reminder had been forwarded to the Respondent State on 23 March 2006 with a\ncopy of the arguments of the Complainant Party attached to it.\n24. In another note verbale dated 4 October 2007, the Secretariat reminded the Respondent State that the\nCommission's decision on deferment was firm on the submission of its written arguments within a period of\none month. In this regard, the Secretariat reminded the Respondent State that if it failed to present its\narguments, the Commission would proceed with the consideration of the case on the basis of the facts in\nthe file.\n25. At its 44th Ordinary Session held in Abuja, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Commission declared\nthe Communication ADMISSIBLE on the basis of the information in its possession.\n26. By note verbale and letter dated 19 December 2008, the Secretariat of the Commission informed the\nparties that it had declared the Communication admissible and invited them to submit on the merits of the\ncase before the 45th Ordinary Session scheduled for 13 to 27 May 2009 in Banjul, The Gambia.\n27. By note verbale and letter dated 24th April, 2009, the Secretariat of the Commission advised the parties\nto file their submissions on the merits of the Communication at the 45th Ordinary Session scheduled for 13th\nto 27th May, 2009 in Banjul, the Gambia.\n\n2\n\n\fLaw\nAdmissibility\nArguments of the Complainant on Admissibility\n\n28. The Complainant argues that the Communication meets all the requirements laid down by Article 56 of\nthe African Charter. He emphasizes that the Victim is well known and that the Complaint is compatible with\nthe Charter as it relates to alleged violations by the DRC of Articles 3, 7 and 14 of the African Charter.\n29. Still according to the Complainant, the complaint filed at the Commission does not contain any\ndisparaging remarks against Congolese authorities.\n30. The Complainant notes that his Complaint is based on real facts as evidenced by the numerous\ndocuments submitted in support of the complaint.\n31. The Complainant also alleges that local remedies under Congolese law have been exhausted, given\nthat the Complainant seized the High Court of Bukavu and the Bukavu Appeals Court.\n32. The Complainant declares that following a petition lodged on 12 July 1991, the Supreme Court of\nJustice, by ruling in judgement No. RC/1704/1705, dated 3 March 1994, had overturned judgement No. RC\n1155/1180/1729 delivered on 8 April 1991 by the Bukavu Appeals Court and referred the case to the\nAppeals Court in Kinshasa/Matete. By Judgement No. RAC 001 delivered on 29 December 1994, the Court\nof Appeal in Kinshasa Matete rejected the appeals of the appellants, namely State, Noca and Kizila.\n33. The complainant alleges that a second appeal for annulment of judgment No. RAC 001 rendered on 29\nDecember 1994 by the Court of Appeal of Kinshasa/Matete was lodged with the Supreme Court and\nregistered under RC029/TSR.\n34. The Complainant alleges having even resorted to extraordinary remedies which are vested solely in the\nMinister of Justice and Attorney General who had declared the remedy unavailable as confirmed by letter\nNo. 1023/mm90/CAB/MIN/J/2004, dated 23 March 2004, which was sent in response to the letter from Mr.\nManzila,dated 12 December 2003 (documents attached to the file).\n35. The Complainant asserts that the Complaint was lodged with the Commission for almost three months\nafter delivery of the final judgment by the Supreme Court on 28 November 2003 and that the Commission\nis the only body seized of this matter.\nArguments of the Respondent State on Admissibility\n\n36. The Respondent State made no submission on the admissibility of this communication despite\nnumerous reminders that had been forwarded to it.\nAnalysis of the Commission on Admissibility\n\n37. The admissibility of Communications submitted in accordance with Article 55 of the Charter is governed\nby the requirements stipulated in Article 56 of the same Charter.\n38. The Commission consistently made sustained efforts to get the Respondent State to forward its written\narguments and observations on admissibility since its 35th Ordinary Session held from 21 May to 4 June\n2004 in Banjul, The Gambia, when the Commission was seized of the Communication.\n39. The Commission therefore notes the refusal by the Respondent State to cooperate, and is obliged to\nconsider the Communication on the basis of verifiable information provided by the Complainant.\n40. Furthermore, it must be noted that during the 42nd Ordinary Session held in Brazzaville, Congo, a\ndelegation of the Respondent State pledged to exercise due diligence in order to forward its written\narguments on admissibility.\n41. The Respondent State, however, did not make any submissions to dispute the arguments of the\nComplainant on the admissibility of the case.\n42. As a result, the Commission declares the Communication admissible in accordance with Article 119\nparagraph 45 of its Rules of Procedure and with its own jurisprudence.6\n\n3\n\n\fMERITS\nObservations of the Complainant on the Merits\n\n43. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated his rights guaranteed by the African\nCharter. In specific terms, the Complainant alleges the violation of Articles 3, 7.1c and 14 of the African\nCharter.\nOn the alleged violation of Article 14\n44. The Complainant alleges that in execution of the measures referred to as economic, based on\nCongolese legislation adopted on 2 July 1974 in relation to abandoned or undeveloped properties and\nother assets acquired by the State under the law, Mr. NOCA's building covered by the registration\ncertificate drawn up on 1st September 1952, was declared abandoned.\n45. The Complainant also alleges that before leaving the DRC for his native country, Italy, Mr. Dino NOCA\nhad taken precautions by entrusting the management of his building to SONAS, an official institution of the\nCongolese State. This, according to the Complainant, was one of the conditions for eluding this measure\nwhich was aimed at declaring his building as abandoned.\n46. The Complainant also asserts that despite the fact that Mr. NOCA had complied with this requirement,\nthe greed to grab the assets of foreigners made some Congolese citizens, in collusion with some State\nofficials, to outwit the vigilance of the authorities and declare NOCA's building as abandoned. Thanks to the\nintervention of SONAS, an opposition to this action was granted by the Minister of Lands and Property.\n47. The Complainant alleges that Mr. NOCA is the undisputed owner of the building situated at no17R/2 in\nIbanda in the city of Bukavu and this is based on a registration certificate issued to him by the Curator of\nLanded Property Titles on 1st September 1952, an act which consequently recognizes the property right of\nthe Victim under Congolese law.\n48. The Complainant further argues that on the basis of Article 227 of the Congolese Land Law, the\nregistration certificate is indisputable after two years of existence with effect from the date of its\nestablishment, and the Complainant further argues that notwithstanding this Article 227 of the Land Law\nand of Article 14 of the African Charter, Mr. NOCA was deprived of his property right.\n49. According to the Complainant, on the basis of Order No 74-152 of 2 July 1974 on abandoned or\nundeveloped properties and other assets acquired by the State under the law, a Ministerial Order\nn?1440/000152/80 of 3 September 1980 all the same declared residential plot n?17R/2 situated in\nIbanda-Bukavu as abandoned, thus undermining the rights of the Victim.\n50. The Complainant further alleges that two years after the appeal for annulment filed by SONAS, the\nabove mentioned Order was annulled by Order no1440/000207/82 of 20 September 1982.\n51. The Complainant asserts that the Order of the Minister responsible for Landed Property and Real\nEstate was communicated by letter dated 20 September 1982 to the SONAS Property Manager on the\nsame day.\n52. The Complainant also alleges that two years after the annulment of the Order of 3rd September 1980,\nthe President of the Republic pronounced the Order no84-026 of 2nd February 1984 relating to the repeal of\nthe Order on abandoned or undeveloped property and other assets acquired by the State under the law of\n2 July 1974.\n53. The Complainant also points out that the repeal of this Order had been justified in these terms:\n\"unfortunately, the difficulty of determining the objective criteria of the abandonment, the insufficiency and\nthe vagueness of those set out by this Order (of 2nd July 1974), the brevity of the opposition time frame and\nthe inefficiency of the publicity measures have given rise to an alarming opinion at both the national and\ninternational levels that this law is only aimed at merely confiscating the landed property of foreigners.\nFurthermore, its application has given rise to considerable fraud. Several unscrupulous and dishonest\nindividuals with the complicity of the Public Service, have used it to defraud others illegally. This has\nresulted in the numerous cases of litigation now pending before our Courts and Tribunals and which too\noften undermine the responsibility of the State\".\n54. The Complainant alleges that the NOCA case is an illustration of this relation in which the complicity of\nthe administration is evidenced in the manoeuvres of the Real Estate Curator (State Official) of the city of\nBukavu who, under the guise of adherence to procedure, and by his letter dated 30th May 1984, requested\nfrom his superior, the Minister responsible for Landed Property and Real Estate, clarification regarding the\nauthenticity of Order n?1440/000207/09/82 of 20th September 1982 which repealed Order\n4\n\n\fno1440/000152/80 of 3rd September 1980 because there was no trace of the said document in the file of\nthe disputed property and his Department had only a photocopy.\n55. The Complainant further alleges that only 8 days after forwarding his letter to the Minister for Landed\nProperty, namely on the 9th June 1984, this official, who was bent on undermining the interests of Mr. Noca,\ndecided to issue the registration certificate for Mr. NOCA's building to Mr. KAFWA, in violation, among\nothers, of the provisions of Article 235 of the Land Law which stipulates that: \"except in cases where the\nassignment is ordered by law or in those provided for by special laws, no assignment can be effected\nwithout prior delivery to the Curator of a certificate in replacement. In all cases of assignment, the old\ncertificate recorded in the Registration Book must be marked with an annulment stamp and with a note\nindicating, in the format established by Article 226, the reasons for annulment and the date and number of\nthe new certificate\".\n56. The Complainant recalls the fact that this decision of the Curator notwithstanding, close to 25 days\nafterwards, namely on the 5th July 1984, the Minister for Land Matters sent a letter and a phone message\nto the Curator in which he confirmed the repeal of the Order of 3rd September 1980, but this did not bother\nthe Curator to the point of making him go back on his decision and annul the registration certificate which\nhad been unjustly established for the benefit of Mr. KAFWA.\n57. The Complainant underscores that the right to property guaranteed by the Charter is fully recognized by\nthe Constitution of the DRC and conveyed by the Congolese doctrine. Indeed, Article 36 of the Constitution\nstipulates that \"private property is sacred. The State guarantees individual or collective property rights\nacquired pursuant to law or custom.\"7 These rights may be undermined only by virtue of a law and for\nreasons of general interest, subject to prior and fair compensation payable to the person being deprived of\nhis rights. Finally, according to Article 37 paragraph 2 of the Constitution \"No one shall be dispossessed of\nhis property except by virtue of a decision taken by a competent judicial authority.\"\n58. The Complainant considers that all these constitutional provisions establish the constitutional bases\nand value of property in general and, in particular ownership, in the DRC.\n59. The Complainant points out that the decision of the Curator is confiscatory and devoid of any legal\nbasis considering that the Order declaring the NOCA building abandoned and the Ordinance on abandoned\nproperty had been repealed.\n60. The Complainant argues that the repeal of the Order of 3rd September 1980 and the Order of 2nd July\n1974 have amply buttressed Mr. NOCA's right to ownership of the aforementioned building.\n61. The Complainant concludes that despite the two repeals and the constitutional guarantees of property\nrights, the State, through its agent the Curator of Landed Property, has wrongfully dispossessed Mr. NOCA\nof his property. Hence it may safely be concluded that Article 14 of the Charter has been violated.\nOn the violation of Articles 3 and 7. 1. c\n62. The Complainant alleges that despite the formal decision taken by the aforementioned Minister to\nremove the NOCA building from the category of abandoned assets, Mr. Kafwa, then State Prosecutor at\nthe Bukavu High Court in South Kivu, used his position of authority and his relations with the South Kivu\nprovincial authorities to obtain a Title Deed for the NOCA building.\n63. Alerted by SONAS, the Ministers of Justice and Land Matters instructed the State Counsel for Kivu\nProvince to seize the Court for the annulment of the Title Deed illegally issued to the former Public\nProsecutor Mr. Kafwa.\n64. The Complainant submits that on the basis of the observation that the State Commissioner for Land\nAffairs had annulled the letter allocating the disputed property in favour of citizen KAFWA through letter No.\n1440/OOO7/48/84 of 5th July 1984, the Congolese State had instituted proceedings under RC 1443 against\nKAFWA for the annulment of the Certificate issued to the latter to the detriment of the late NOCA. Contrary\nto all expectations, the Bukavu Tribunal had rejected the request of the State for non justification through its\nJudgement of 10th June 1985 which was to be served on the State of DRC on the 17 July 1985 represented\nby the Governor of the Kivu Region in Bukavu.\n65. The Complainant goes on to say that curiously, the same Governor of the Region who had issued an\nillegal order to the Curator to issue the registration certificate to Mr. KAFWA, even though the Judgement\nhad quite rightly been served on him, refrained from seizing the competent authorities to appeal against this\nruling.\n66. Nonetheless, according to the Complainant, the Appeals Court was seized by special powers of the\nMinister of Justice to the State Attorney against this decision considered illegal. Thus, the Government of\nthe DRC, through its Secretary of State for Justice filed an appeal under RCA 1180 against the Judgement\n5\n\n\fof 10 June 1985. For his part, against this same ruling, the successors of the late NOCA instituted a\nthird-party opposition under RC 1729 before the Bukavu High Court, but the Appeals Judge confirmed his\ncolleague's first proof ruling.\n67. The Complainant further states that the Minister gave a second instruction to his Counsel in the\nSupreme Court to seize this Court to set aside the Judgement rendered by the Bukavu Appeals Court. This\njudgement was annulled and the case returned to the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court.\n68. The Complainant alleges that the State did not win the case before this Court and again through the\nintermediary of the Minister of Justice introduced a second petition for annulment against the judgement\nRAC 001 of 29/12/1994 issued by the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court. The Supreme Court, seized once\nagain, did not give in to the State's request and the case was dismissed.\n69. The Complainant notes that the demise of Mr. Lucio Noca in Sorvedolo, Italy in 1992, occurred\nsubsequent to the institution of the first annulment proceedings initiated in 1991 and the Supreme Court\ndeemed it necessary to call the Noca successor to the case to enable the latter to present his case and\ndefend his interests just like Mr. Kafwa.\n70. According to the Complainant, the ruling of the Supreme Court under Judgement No RCR/C 019 of 14\nJuly 2000 ordered the successors in title of the late NOCA to continue the suit in the following terms: \"Start\nproceedings to allow perfecting of the case. Give instructions for the notification of dates to be issued\ncollectively to the successors in title of the late NOCA LUCIO to the elected Domicile during his lifetime\". 8\n71. The Complainant further alleges that, on the subject of the pursuance of the lawsuit, this Judgement\nputs forward the following reasons: \"the Court indicates that the combination of Articles 19 and 20 of the\nprocedure applicable before it, the time frame appoints beforehand the 6 months set out collectively to the\nsuccessors in title at the last elected domicile. This formality was not fulfilled in this case. In consequence,\nsince Mr. NOCA's successors in title were not informed of the current proceedings, they cannot be\npresumed to have withdrawn from the pursuance of the lawsuit\".\n72. The Complainant contends that afterwards the Dino Noca party was summoned to pursue the lawsuit\nby a writ served by a bailiff 9 under the terms of Judgment No RCR/C 019 of 14 July 2002.\n73. The Complainant states that as the sole heir to Lucio Noca's estate,Mr. Dino Noca responded to the\nsummons of the Supreme Court to resume the suit during which he became a constrained party, a position\nwhich is clarified by an author as follows: \"where a party has just died when a case is pending, a voluntary\nor constrained resumption of the suit may be resorted to by the heirs in order to continue the\nproceedings\"10\n74. The Complainant also alleges that it is surprising to note that in spite of the decision by the Supreme\nCourt to resume the case pending before it, the latter surprisingly prohibited the NOCA Party, under\njudgement RCR/C019 delivered on the merit on 28th November 2003, from submitting the case for the\ndefence by rejecting the right of the Noca succession's pursuance of the suit that it had itself decided and a\nallow a third-party opposition. According to that Judgement, the following was stipulated: \"regarding the\nthird-party opposition and the pursuance of the suit, the Court rules that the Judgement RC029/TSR having\nbeen declared inadmissible, the joint appeal of 3rd May 1995 as emanating from Mr. NOCA Lucio who had\npassed away on the 27th May 1992, the issue is definitively settled since Judgement No RAC/001 of 29\nDecember 1994 of the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court which had acquired competence of the case had\nirrevocably judged against the NOCA Lucio successors. Consequently, the pursuance of the suit should not\nhave been ordered\".11\n75. The Complainant regrets that in spite of his determination to continue the suit, the Supreme Court did\nnot give him that opportunity because it rescinded its decision to allow the suit to continue by nullifying it,\nwhereas in such circumstances, if the Supreme Court had thought it had made a mistake by forcing Dino\nNoca to continue the suit, it should have reopened proceedings for the purposes of notifying Dino Noca of\nthis fact.\n76. The Complainant believes that the parties should therefore take the written conclusions and present\narguments on the position of the Supreme Court with regard to the resumption of the suit by the heirs of\nlate Noca which is presumed to have been wrongly ordered.\n77. The Complainant asserts that the final decision RCR/C019 of 28 November 2003 pretends to be\nunaware of the existence of the previous decision RCR/C 019 of 14 July 2002, which provides the above\nreasons as justification for the pursuance of the suit by the Noca claimants.\n78. The Complainant is outraged at the possibility that the composition of the Court, which is the author of\nthe decision of 28 November 2003, should have a real problem of interpretation of these two decisions\nwhich it was required to reconcile in light of the judgment delivered by all sections put together.\n6\n\n\f79. The Complainant further alleges that the final judgment RCR/CO19 of 28 November 2003 which\ndismissed the obligation to reopen the proceedings for hearings on the position of Dino Noca, thus deprived\nthe latter of the \"right to have his case heard\", which right would have provided the Noca party the\npossibility of appearing for hearing at the Court to prove its claims to the building under litigation12\n80. The Complainant further alleges that this attitude of the Court violates in consequence Article 7. 1c and\nArticle 3 of the African Charter. On the one hand, the Noca Lucio successors represented by their legal\nliquidator Mr. Dino Noca had not had the opportunity to adequately prepare their case for the defense, the\nevidence and submission of arguments to counter the claims and evidence of the adverse party. On the\nother hand, the principle of equality before the law stipulated in Article 3 of the Charter was violated since\nonly the case of the opposing party, in this instance Mr. Kafwa, had been taken into account.\n81. According to the Complainant, in light of the foregoing, there is no shadow of doubt that the provisions\nof Article 7. 1c and 3 of the Charter were violated by the Supreme Court, an institution run by officials of\nState of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nArguments of the Respondent State on the Merits\n\n82. The Respondent State claims that following a request for land ownership signed on 30 January 1984 by\nMr. Kafwa, then Public Prosecutor in Bukavu, the Curator of Real Estate of Bukavu by letter\nn?2448.5/820/84 of 27 March 1984, had proposed to the State Commissioner responsible for Land Issues\nthat he be allocated the building situated on plot 17R/2 in Ibanda, formerly owned by NOCA and declared\nabandoned by Order n?1440/000152/80 of 3 September 1980 and allocated the same day to a certain\nMATAKINA who up to the date of the proposal had not paid for the cost to the Public Treasury.\n83. The Respondent State argues that at the time the Curator of Title Deeds was making this proposal, he\nwas unaware that the abandonment order had already been repealed by Order No. 1440/000207/82 of 20\nSeptember 1982\n84. The Respondent State alleges that in response to the letter from the Curator of Title Deeds, the State\nCommissioner allocated the disputed building to the party per letter no 1445/21/000605/84 of 23 May 1984.\nHowever, at the time that the registrar was getting ready to issue the title deeds to give effect to the\nallocation made by the State Commissioner, he was informed about the existence of the repeal order.\n85. The Respondent State further indicates that by a letter dated 30 May 1984, it requested the State\nCommissioner to confirm the authenticity of the said Order of which he had only been provided with an\nordinary photocopy. On 2nd June 1984, the Governor of the Region requested the Curator to prepare the\nTitle Deed in favour of Mr. KAFWA in view of the former owner's lack of interest in recovering his property.\n86. The Respondent State in its memorandum states that on the 9th June 1984, the Curator of Real Estate\nsigned a lifetime lease with the applicant in favour of whom he prepared the registration certificate volume\nF 82-folio3, sequel to the receipt by the Authorities of the costs relating to the valuation of the building as\nwell as the related expenses, so that following the annulment of the Order that had declared the property\nabandoned, the concerned parties could no longer make a claim to the legal authorities for the building for\nwhich the ownership had been finally and legally allocated to the applicant pursuant to Section 227 of the\nLand Law which stipulates that the registration certificate was final and constituted evidence as of right of\nthe ownership of the building.\n87. The Respondent State further says that on the 18th July 1984, the DRC, on the signing by the State\nCommissioner in charge of Landed Property, instructed his Counsel in the following terms: \"the Curator has\nissued a registration certificate to Citizen KAFWA KASONGO BIN KASENDE. This certificate, having no\nlegal basis, I ask you to institute legal proceedings for its annulment\".\n88. It would appear from the arguments of the Respondent State that using as basis the Report of the State\nCommissioner for Landed Property, the DRC had instituted a lawsuit against Mr. KAFWA under RC 1443\nrequesting the annulment of Mr. KAFWA's registration certificate. The outcome was a Judgement on the\n10th June 1985, the terms of which declared the demurrer groundless for want of qualification raised by the\nRespondent; the suit of the original plaintiff and dismissed it in consequence; the suit of the Respondent on\nreconversion; and condemned each of the Parties to pay half of the taxed costs.\n89. The Respondent State shows further that the Republic of Zaire (currently DRC) was notified of the\nJudgement on the 17th July 1985 represented by the Regional President of the MPR and the Governor of\nthe Kivu Region in Bukavu who was in the latter's office discussing it with Mr. BALAGIZI, official of the\nGovernorate who signed for receipt of the notification, in conformity with Article 8 of the Civil Procedure\nCode.\n7\n\n\f90. The Respondent State further indicates that the DRC having refrained from filing an appeal within the\ntimeframe laid down by law, the Chief Registrar of the Kivu Appeals Court in Bukavu issued to Mr. KAFWA\non the 19th August 1985, a certificate reporting the absence of any appeal on the part of the DRC against\nruling No RC.1443.\n91. In order to fully enjoy his right of ownership, Mr. KAFWA filed a writ for eviction under RC 1683 on 22\nNovember 1985 against Mr. KIZILA wa TUBULWA who according to the Respondent State was occupying\nthe disputed building with neither Title Deed nor right under RC 1683.\n92. The case having been adjourned on two successive occasions, it eventually took place with Mr. NOCA\nLucio and Mr. KASILEMBO KAKIENGNE through a subpoena for intervention of 3 January 1986.\n93. The Respondent State asserts that during the proceedings Mr. KASILEMBO had placed his withdrawal\non record following a letter of 8 January 1986.\n94. The Respondent State continues by saying that the case (RC 1683) of the 19th February 1986 led to\nMr. KIZILA and his family being condemned to eviction and to the payment of an amount of fifty thousand\n(50,000) zaire to Mr. KAFWA; and also condemned Messrs NOCA Lucio, KAZILA, KASILEMBO to pay a\nthird each of the costs.\n95. The Respondent State still in its memorandum declared that the DRC, sequel to the acquisition of a\nspecial proxy provided by the Secretary of State for Justice on behalf of DRC filed an appeal on the 12th\nFebruary 1986 under RCA.1180 against the Judgement RC.1443.\n96. Mr. KIZILA also filed for appeal under RCA 1155 against RC 1683 of 19 February 1986. Mr. NOCA\nLucio also instituted proceedings under RC 1729 before the Bukavu High Court supposedly in third-party\nopposition against Judgement No RC 1443.\n97. The Respondent State further declares that by a ruling of the 7th July 1986, the Bukavu High Court\nreferred the case in third-party opposition on the express request of the third opponent NOCA Lucio to the\nCourt of Appeal for it to be joined to that of RCA 1155 which was pending on the appeal of KIZILA and\nRCA.1180 pending on the appeal of the Republic.\n98. A single and only Judgement was delivered by the Bukavu Court of Appeal after having ruled on the\nentire litigation after combination of the different cases under RCA 1180/1155 and RC 1729, declaring them\ninadmissible for violation of the law of Mr. NOCA's third party opposition under RC 1729 and the appeal of\nthe Republic under RCA 1180 and the unjustified appeal of Mr. KIZILA under RCA.1155.\n99. The Respondent State further declares that the first appeal for annulment of judgement No.\nRCA1155/1180/1729 of 9 April 1991 was filed through the requests of 31st May and 25th June 1991 by the\nparties NOCA Lucio, KIZILA and the DRC under RC1704/1705. The outcome was a Judgement of the 3rd\nMarch 1994 delivered by the Supreme Court referring the case to the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court and\nstated the law that: \"the jurisdiction of discharge should not take into account the notification of the first\nproof ruling served to the Governor of the Region in lieu and on behalf of the Ministry of Justice or of his\ndelegate to decree the inadmissibility of the appeal by the Republic of Zaire for lateness\".\n100. The Respondent State also intimates that in view of Mr. NOCA's demise on the 27th May 1992 in\nSorvedolo in Italy, since no haste was made to direct the case to the Matete Appeals Court which had been\nduly seized by the ruling on referral by the Supreme Court, Mr. KAFWA took charge of it by sending to the\ndifferent parties the notifications for appeals and subpoenas and the notifications for the dates of the\ncommon hearings. The Court of Appeal, satisfied that it had been duly seized of the said acts, ruled on the\ncase and pronounced on 20 December 1994, under RCA.001, a ruling confirming the appealed Judgment\nin all its provisions.\n101. The Respondent State asserts that the Judgement delivered paved the way for an appeal for\nannulment initiated under RC. 029/TSR by way of an application filed on 3rd May 1995 at the Registry of\nthe Supreme Court by the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr. Noca Lucio and KIZILA WATUMBULWA\nrespectively.\n102. The Supreme Court ruled by Judgement of the 21st January 2000. It declared inadmissible the appeal\nfor annulment emanating from NOCA Lucio, but received the joint appeal by the DRC and KIZILA\nWATUMBULWA, the said counsel and referred the case to the Judicial Division for ruling on the merits.\n103. The Respondent State further indicates that the case referred by the ruling of the Appeals Court to the\nJudicial Division of the Supreme Court had had two major highlights, namely the pursuance of the suit by\nthe successors of NOCA Lucio, deceased on 27 December 1992, and then the testimony of the said\nsuccessors under the terms of which the late NOCA Lucio, during his lifetime, had already sold the\ndisputed building to Mr. KASILEMO, with the consequence that his successors could no longer lay any\nclaim to the disputed building.\n8\n\n\f104. For the Respondent State, a reproduction of the testimony of the successors and the Deed of\npursuance of the suit was done so as to establish the futility of the lawsuit instituted by Mr. NOCA Dino\nbefore the Commission.\n105. Following reading of the terms of the late NOCA Lucio's will, the Respondent State declares that\nNOCA Dino admitted that his father had sold the disputed building to Mr. KASILEMBO. Therefore, the only\nlogical conclusion to be drawn was that the said building had long ago ceased to be part of Mr. NOCA\nLucio's inheritance and estate. According to the State, it was with good reason that the Supreme Court had\ndismissed all of Mr. NOCA Dino's claims. Consequently, it is up to Mr. KASILEMBO to claim his landed\nproperty.\n106. The Respondent State in its conclusion asserts that according to the history of the facts and\nbackground of the case, Mr. KASILEMBO, having been subpoenaed to the suit RC1683 in voluntary\nintervention of 3rd January 1986, he also voluntarily withdrew his suit and in any case did not file any\nappeal against the Judgement of the 19th February 1986 which had declared his suit inadmissible for non\npayment of deposit. Thus, the real property rights on which Mr. NOCA Dino based his appeal having been\ntransmitted at the time to Mr. KASILEMBO, or at least since 1986, Mr. NOCA Dino should have his appeal\ndismissed for want of qualification due to the absence of his own claimed right to the property.\n107. The Respondent State in its memorandum is of the view that since Mr. NOCA, Father, could not take\nadvantage of a right to property which he had already assigned to a third Party; his successor had\nwrongfully pleaded the violation of Article 14 of the Charter to which he is a stranger.\n108. With regard to the violation of Article 7 of the African Charter, the Respondent State submits that Mr.\nNOCA Dino is taking advantage of his own wrongdoing or more specifically of the fraud in his claim.\n109. The Respondent State in fact further indicates that as the case referred by the ruling of the Appeals\nCourt to the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court for the determination of the merits was the result of the\nfiling of the second appeal which the Supreme Court considered as justified that brought about the second\nappeal, it was only natural for it to be quashed in respect of Mr. NOCA Lucio, once it was revealed at the\nJudicial Division of the Supreme Court that the second appeal which was based on this second appeal was\nfraudulent as it was filed on 3 May 1995 on behalf of Mr. NOCA Lucio whose demise had occurred on 27\nMay,1992.\n110. The Respondent State concludes by saying that it was therefore natural that the successor of the\ndeceased who claimed to have filed an appeal should be kept out of the proceedings.\n111. The Respondent State claims that the Supreme Court's action, the reasoning of which is\nirreproachable in law, cannot at all be considered as a violation of Article 7 of the Charter.\nComplainant's rebuttal on the Merits\n\n112. The Complainant contends that while looking at the facts, the Respondent State has itself outlined the\nprocess of putting the late NOCA at a disadvantage by its officials.\n113. The Complainant points out that following a request for land on the 30th January 1984 submitted by\nMr. KAFWA, then Public Prosecutor in Bukavu, the Curator, who had all the same been informed of the\nabrogation of Order n?1440/000152/80 of 3 September 1980 by Order no 1440/000207/82 of 20 September\n1982 restoring the rights of Mr. Noca.\n114. He notes that the Curator, by complying with an order that is palpably illegal, later on 9 June 1984,\nestablished a registration certificate volume F 82-folio 3, in the form of a title deed in favour of Mr. KAFWA.\n115. The Complainant points out the decision smacks of complicity between the Governor of the region, the\nCurator of title deeds and KAFWA. But he later indicates that later, the Minister of State in charge of\nLanded Property instructed his Counsel Mr. MAMBOLEO in the following terms: \"...the Curator has issued\na registration certificate to citizen KAFWA KASONGO BIN KASENDE. As this registration certificate has no\nlegal basis, I request you to institute proceedings to have it annulled\".\n116. Then began the proceedings of the DRC against KAFWA joined by the NOCA party for the triumph of\njustice and truth.\n117. The Complainant first of all underlines the fact that all the legal actions to which the late NOCA had\nbeen a party or had had to initiate, in the final analysis, had been to defend his interests and that of his\nestate. He points out that at no time in the proceedings did any court sitting on the merits or cassation find it\nnecessary to raise objection, which in principle cannot happen at this stage. No court has ever dismissed\nthe case of the late NOCA for want of quality, an argument which cannot be brought up for the first time\nbefore the Commission by the DRC.\n9\n\n\f118. The Complainant further indicates that in view of the legal proceedings that the Respondent State had\nhad to institute instead of trying to defend itself against the violation of the African Charter by its officials, for\nwhich reason it finds itself before the Commission, it should have taken the lead and humbly acknowledged\nthe injury suffered by the petitioner and in addition propose means of arriving at an amicable settlement of\nthis dispute.\n119. The Complainant alleges that concerning the sole argument seeking the dismissal of NOCA's appeal\non the grounds that the building is no longer the property of the late Mr NOCA and, therefore, of his\nsuccessor; we think it would be useful to have recourse to constant jurisprudence in that contracts can only\ngive rise to actual obligations and cannot affect by themselves the transfer of real rights, even between the\ncontracting parties, and that the conveyance of property can only stem from an entry into the registration\nrecord13 . This ruling by the Court of First Instance was upheld by the Supreme Court.14\n120. The Complainant, in addition, underscored that this jurisprudence has remained constant to this day,\nin spite of the divergence in opinion with regard to the doctrine. On the grounds of this jurisprudence, it was\ndecided that only the holder of a registration certificate can claim ownership of a building and the property\nshall be deemed to belong to him as long as the transfer has not taken place. In this particular case, the\nmatter referred to the Commission by NOCA Dino, son and sole heir to the late NOCA Lucio, can only be\nadmissible because of the position of this jurisprudence.\n121. Moreover, the Complainant argues, as indicated in the memorandum on admissibility, that the African\nCommission does not make legal formalism its pet subject; but that the most important thing is to know\nwhether the African Charter has been violated; which has amply been demonstrated and recognized by the\nRespondent State itself.\n122. The Complainant concludes by praying the Commission, in view of the foregoing, to do justice to the\nComplainant's request and to his subsequent requests.\nThe Commission's Analysis on the Merits\n\n123. In the present Communication, the Commission seeks to determine if the assignment of the Noca\nbuilding to Mr. Kafwa Kasongo constitutes a violation of Articles 3, 7.1(c) and 14 of the African Charter.\n124. The violation of Article 14 of the African Charter will first be examined, given that this provision is the\nsource of the other violations.\n125. Articles 3 and 7.1(c) will be examined together, given that both articles were violated in the same\ncircumstances of time and place.\nAlleged Violation of Article 14\n126. The Complainant argues that the decision taken by the Curator of Title Deeds to issue the registration\ncertificate of Mr. NOCA's building to Mr. KAFWA was a violation of Article 14 of the African Charter.\n127. Article 14 of the African Charter states that: \"The right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be\nencroached upon in the interest of public need or in the general interest of the community and in\naccordance with the provisions of appropriate laws\".15\n128. Before the Commission determines whether Article 14 was violated in this present Communication,\nthere is the need to ascertain who can be the holder of a property right. Article 14 of the Charter does not\nspecify who the holder of the right of ownership is 16 . However, its interpretation in the light of Article 2 of\nthe African Charter 17 , and the jurisprudence of the Commission18 clearly show, beyond reasonable doubt,\nthat every individual has the right to property under the Charter.\n129. In the present Communication, the victim, Mr. Noca, an Italian national, alleges that his property was\nstolen under the pretext of the execution of residential measures referred to as economic measures based\non the Congolese law of 2 July 1974 relative to abandoned or undeveloped property and other assets\nacquired by the State under the law.\n130. The Complainant affirms that in order to avoid the likelihood of his building being declared as\nabandoned, thereby paving the way for its transfer to Congolese nationals; his client had taken all the\nnecessary precaution by entrusting his building to SONAS before leaving the DRC.\n131. Notwithstanding this precaution taken by Mr. Noca, the Complainant said the greed to grab the assets\nof foreigners motivated some Congolese, in collusion with some State officials, to deceive the authorities\nand declare NOCA's building as abandoned through Order No. 1440/000152/80 of 3rd September 1980.\n132. The Complainant argues, however, that following the intervention of SONAS which formulated\nfavourable opposition in this regard and which was accepted by the Minister responsible for landed\n10\n\n\fproperty and real estate matters, a decision was taken to formally exclude NOCA's building from the\ncategory of abandoned buildings as per Order no1440/000207/82 of 20th September 1982.\n133. The Complainant further indicates that two years after the annulment of the Order of 3rd September\n1980, the President of the Republic issued Ordinance No. 84-026 of 2 February 1984 repealing the\nOrdinance relating to abandoned or undeveloped property and other assets acquired by the State under\nthe law.\n134. The Complainant argues that, in spite of these repeals, the Registrar of Land Titles took on the heavy\nresponsibility of issuing to Mr. KAFWA the registration certificate for Mr. NOCA's building.\n135. The Respondent State argues that following a land application by Mr. KAFWA, then State Prosecutor\nat the Bukavu High Court, the Registrar of property titles proposed he should be allocated the property\nformerly owned by Mr. NOCA, which was declared abandoned on 3rd September 1980 and allocated on the\nsame day to a certain MATAKINA who, until the date of the proposal had not made any payment into the\npublic treasury.\n136. In its response, the Respondent State claimed that at the time the Registrar made the proposal, he\nwas unaware that the 1980 Abandonment Order had been repealed by Order no 1440/000207/82 of 20\nSeptember 1982 19 .\n137. The Commission notes that though it is true that the administration was unaware of the repeal and the\nopposition raised during the procedure for registration and issuance of the title deed and issued a title deed\nfor a piece of land which already had a title deed, it means that the State failed in its obligation to protect\nthe rights of foreigners living in its territory, and that the State could have demonstrated good faith by\nreinstating the rights of the victim.\n138. In any case, the Commission notes that the Head of the Lands Department in the city of Bukavu\nreceived a copy of the annulment of the Order declaring the NOCA building as abandoned, given that he\neven requested the authentication of the document in his possession. This request was made through\ntelephone message No. 00027/84 of 5 July 1984 and letter No. 1.440/000748 of the same 5 July 1984,\nfrom the Minister of Lands, then State Commissioner, confirming the repeal of Order No. 1.440/000152/80.\n139. The Commission also notes that even though the Head of the Lands Department had requested\nauthentication of the document, he did not wait for the aforementioned responses, but proceeded with the\nissuance of the registration certificate to Mr. Kafwa Kasongo.\n140. The Commission deplores the lack of diligence and goodwill on the part of the Head of Division, who\nbefore the assignment of the Noca plot of land, could have waited for the response of the Minister of Lands\nin respect of the authenticity of the copy relating to the annulment of the Order declaring the building as\nabandoned property.\n141. It is quite right that the Complainant cites jurisprudence according to which only the holder of a\nregistration certificate can lay claim to the ownership of a building and the property is deemed to belong to\nhim as long as the transfer of property ownership has not been made.\n142. On the argument of the Respondent State that due to the lack of interest by the former owner to\nrecover his property, the Commission believes that for the owner to entrust the management of his building\nto SONAS before leaving Zaire (now DRC) was a means for Mr. NOCA to maintain his property a link with\nhis property which excludes lack of interest to recover his property as claimed by the Respondent State.\n143. The Commission notes that the right to ownership embodies two key principles. The first is a general\none which focuses on the principle of the right of ownership and the peaceful enjoyment of property. The\nsecond principle focuses on the possibility and condition of deprivation of the right to property 20 . Article 14\nof the African Charter recognizes that States are authorized to violate it under certain circumstances,\nparticularly, to control the use of the property in the public or general interest by administering laws which\nare deemed necessary towards that end.\n144. In Communication 276/2003 Centre for Minority Rights Development (Kenya) and Minority Rights\nGroup International on behalf of Endorois Welfare Council vs. Kenya (Endorois case), of May 2009, the\nCommission dealt at length with the right to ownership and established a two-pronged criterion which sets\nout that this right cannot be violated except \"in the interest of the public or in the general interest of the\ncommunity\" and \"in conformity with the provisions of the appropriate laws\" 21 ; this latter aspect referring to\ndomestic and international laws 22 .\n145. At the same time, the Commission has indicated that the limitations to the right to property should be\ndetermined in the light of the principle of proportionality, meaning that interference in the right to property\nmust be \"proportional to a legitimate need, and should represent the least restrictive measure possible\" 23 .\nThat is not the case for the Communication under review.\n11\n\n\f146. Moreover, in the situation depicted in the present Communication, the Commission notes that the\nState has not demonstrated that the Complainant's building was confiscated in the interest of public need\nor general interest. The deprivation was done without any legal basis as the Respondent State itself had\ntaken so many decisions on the same building in the interest of the Complainant.\n147. Without such a justification and adequate compensation determined by an impartial court of\ncompetent jurisdiction, the African Commission believes that the actions of the Respondent State are in\nviolation of the right to property guaranteed by Article 14 of the African Charter. 24\n148. On the defence of the Respondent State that it was no longer admissible for the interested parties to\nclaim before the court property whose ownership was finally and legally vested in the applicant under\nArticle 227 of the Land Law which provides that the registration certificate is an absolute proof of ownership\nof buildings, the Commission believes that it is never too late to stop any violation and make reparation for\nits consequences.\n149. The Commission notes that the Respondent State is not contesting the repeal of the Order of 3rd\nSeptember 1980 as well as the Ordinance of 2nd July, 1974, texts which are the basis for the withdrawal of\nthe disputed building from the inheritance of Mr. Noca.\n150. The Commission believes these two repeals fully consolidated the ownership right of Mr. NOCA to the\nabove mentioned building; given that after the repeal, the Order declaring the Noca building an abandoned\nproperty became null and void.\n151. The Commission, from a legal standpoint, further believes the annulment of the two Orders ought to\nresult either in the annulment of the Title Deed issued on the basis of these two repealed texts, therefore\ndubiously obtained or the restoration of a duly obtained Title Deed by Mr. Noca.\n152. The Commission further argues that the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter are based on\nprocedural rules for their effective enjoyment. The application of these procedural rules giving effect to the\nenjoyment of those rights should be followed in that, in the present case, their misapplication can deny the\nfundamental rights, thus leading to the limitation or deprivation thereof.\n153. The Commission, based on the two repeals, concludes that there was culpable negligence or a wilful\nmisconduct on the part of the Curator of Title Deeds.\n154. The Commission believes that the Title Deed issued on the basis of repealed texts, therefore\nnon-existent, is itself non-existent, and without any effect.\n155. The Commission recalls the principle enshrined in Article 1 of the Charter, according to which States\nParties not only recognize the rights, obligations and freedoms proclaimed in the Charter, but also\nundertake to respect them and to take steps for their implementation. In other words, if a State Party cannot\nensure respect of the rights contained in the African Charter, this constitutes a violation of the Charter25 .\n156. The Commission, in Communication 155/96 on the Ogoni case, adopted an integral approach,\nnotably pertaining to the correlative obligations of the State. The Commission has insisted on the\nresponsibility of States to protect their citizens \"not only by enacting appropriate legislation and by applying\nthem effectively, but also by protecting the said citizens from prejudicial activities which may be perpetrated\nby private parties.\"26\n157. The Commission points out that from its jurisprudence: All rights, civil, political, social and economic,\ncreate at least four levels of obligations for a State which undertakes to adopt a system of rights, in\nparticular the responsibility of respecting, protecting, promoting and fulfilling these rights. These obligations\nare universally applied to all the rights and impose a combination of negative and positive responsibilities.\n27\n\n158. The Commission further considers that it is the duty of States to investigate and remedy violations\nunder the general obligations incumbent on them pursuant to Article 1 of the African Charter on Human\nand Peoples' Rights which provides that States must adopt legislative or other measures to implement the\nrights, duties and freedoms enshrined in the Charter. \"They need to prevent acts that violate any right\nrecognized by international human rights law, investigate such acts or punish the perpetrators\". 28\n159. The Commission further believes that it is the obligation of the Respondent State to respect the right to\nproperty. For the African Commission, the right to property set out in Article 14 of the Charter relating to\nland and housing, implies in particular, the protection from arbitrary deprivation of the enjoyment of property\nrights, adequate compensation for public acquisition, nationalization or expropriation, peaceful enjoyment of\nproperty and protection from arbitrary eviction 29 .\n160. This obligation prohibits States from interfering arbitrarily in the enjoyment of property rights.\nExpropriation without legal grounds or which is not performed in the public interest is an example of breach\nof the obligation to respect the right to property.\n12\n\n\f161. It is also noteworthy that the Commission has an independent and broad conception of the right to\nproperty, particularly in Communication no 276/03, Centre for Minority Rights Development (Kenya) and\nMinority Rights Group (on behalf of Endorois Welfare Council) vs. Kenya - the Ogoni case, where it held\nthat \"the right to property includes not only the right of access to one's property and freedom from violation\nof the enjoyment of such property or injury to it, but also the free possession and utilization and control of\nsuch property, in a manner the owner deems adequate\" 30 .\n162. The Commission feels that the State is obliged to protect the holders of rights against other subjects,\nby legislation and the provision of effective remedies. This obligation requires the State to take measures to\nprotect beneficiaries of the protected rights against political, economic and social interference. Protection\ngenerally entails the creation and maintenance of an atmosphere or a framework through an effective\ninterplay of laws and regulations, so that individuals can freely exercise their rights and freedoms. This is\ninextricably linked to one of the obligations of the State which consists in promoting the enjoyment of all\nhuman rights 31 .\n163. The Commission further believes that by adopting laws on abandoned properties, the State should\nhave taken all the necessary measures to ensure that there would be no misapplications whatsoever of\nthese laws to the extent of arbitrarily and unjustly depriving an individual for the benefit of another.\n164. On the argument advanced by the Respondent State that Mr Noca's successor cannot lay claim to a\nproperty which no longer belonged to his father, the Complainant in his reply points out that the purpose of\nall legal actions, in which the late NOCA was involved or initiated, were to defend his interests and that of\nhis successors, and that at no time of the procedure did the Congolese State raise such an exception,\nwhich in principle cannot be done at this stage.\n165. The Commission should seek to know, considering the argument advanced by the Respondent State,\nwhether or not the Complainant is the holder of the disputed property in order to claim ownership thereof.\n166. The Commission notes that, based on the provisions of Section 235 of the said Congolese Land Law\nwhich provides that: \"Except in cases where the transfer is ordered by the courts or in cases based on\nspecific legislation no transfer may be made until after delivery to the Curator of the certificate in\nreplacement. In all cases of transfer, the old certificate entered in the registration book shall be marked with\na cancellation stamp and a notation indicating, in the form established by Article 226, the reasons for the\ncancellation and the date and number of the new certificate\", only the holder of a registration certificate duly\nestablished can lay claim to property in the form of a building and the property is expected to belong to him\nfor as long as possible that the transfer would not have occurred.\n167. Except for the presentation of a certificate which would have been drafted by the NOCA succession,\nthe Respondent State, has not proved the existence of the sales contract or proved that the transfer of\nownership had indeed taken place.\n168. The Commission further reminds the Congolese State that at no time during the proceedings was Dino\nNoca's lack of interest raised. Neither the lower courts nor those of appeal had ever rejected the late NOCA\nor the State of DRC for lack of interest.\n169. The Commission takes note that Mr. Noca has brought several actions in real estate to claim his right\nto property without winning his case.\n170. The Commission, based on the property management agreement concluded in due and proper form\nbetween Mr. Lucio Noca, owner of the building, and SONAS, before Mr. Lucio Noca left the DRC to prevent\nit from being considered abandoned property, including all steps taken by him before he died and by his\nson after the death of the owner for the return of the property in the Noca heritage, are a proof of the\ninterest that Mr. NOCA had in the building.\n171. Furthermore, as far as the Commission is concerned, to admit that a person, in this case the son of\nthe deceased, would recognize the sale of his father's plot of land to a third party and still continue to bear\nthe expenses and transportation costs of his counsel to pursue the case, in the absence of any grounds in\nthis particular case, is an inconceivable fact.\n172. The Commission further notes that there was no reaction from the alleged purchaser, and that the\nargument of the Respondent State that the building had long ceased to be part of the estate of Mr. Noca,\nwho may have sold it to Mr. KASILEMBO, who himself withdrew from the case, is not admissible given that\nthe administration had at the same time recognized the property right of Mr. Noca to the disputed property.\n173. The Commission ultimately concludes that given the proven misconduct of the administration,\nresulting in particular from an irregularity committed in the procedure for granting the title deed that was still\nin the inheritance of Mr. Dino Noca, the Respondent State has indisputably violated Article 14 of the\nAfrican Charter.\n13\n\n\fAlleged violation of Articles 3 and 7.1c\n174. The Complainant alleged that the decision taken by the Supreme Court in Judgment RC029/TSR\nprohibiting the NOCA party from presenting its defence and the decision by the latter Court rejecting the\nresumption of proceedings by the Noca succession and the third-party opposition violated the principle of\nArticles 3 and 7.1c of the Charter.\n175. Article 3 stipulates that: \"Every individual shall be equal before the law. Every individual shall be\nentitled to equal protection of the law\".\n176. Article 7.1c for its part provides that \"Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard.\nThis right includes the right to defence and the right to be defended by counsel of one's choice\".\n177. The Complainant alleges that the disputed decision was motivated in these terms: \"regarding the\nthird-party opposition and the pursuance of the suit, the Court rules that the Judgement RC029/TSR having\nbeen declared inadmissible, the joint appeal of 3rd May 1995 as emanating from Mr. NOCA Lucio who\npassed away on the 27th May 1992, the issue is definitively settled since the Judgement RAC/001 of 29\nDecember 1994 of the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court which had acquired competence of the case had\nirrevocably judged against the NOCA Lucio successors. Consequently, the pursuance of the suit should not\nhave been prescribed\".32\n178. In this communication, the victim complained of not having had the opportunity to present his defence.\nAfter the death of Mr. Lucio NOCA, biological father of Dino NOCA, the Supreme Court found it necessary\nto call the Noca succession to the trial to allow him to present his defence so that his rights in the disputed\nproperty are protected in the same way as those claimed by Mr. Kafwa on the same property.\n179. The Complainant emphasizes that by Judgment No. RCR/C 019 of 14 July 2000, the Supreme Court\nsummoned the entitled beneficiaries of the late NOCA to continue the proceedings.\n180. Moreover, the Complainant adds that the pursuance of this lawsuit was decided on the following\ngrounds: \"since Mr. NOCA's successors in title were not informed of the current proceedings, they cannot\nbe presumed to have withdrawn from pursuing the lawsuit\".\n181. The Complainant argues that despite his determination to pursue the proceedings, the Supreme Court\ndid not give him that opportunity because it reversed its decision on the continuation of the lawsuit, by\nnullifying it for the reason that the issue is definitively settled since the Judgement RAC/001 of 29\nDecember 1994 of the Kinshasa/Matete Appeals Court which had acquired competence of the case had\nirrevocably judged against the NOCA Lucio successors.\n182. The Complainant alleges that the right to equality before the courts guaranteed by the Charter was\nviolated by the Supreme Court, given that only the arguments of Mr Kafwa, the other party, were\nconsidered as opposed to those of Mr Noca who was refused from pursuing the case.\n183. The Respondent State states for its part that the approach of the Supreme Court whose reasoning is\nimpeccable in law can in no way be regarded as a violation of Article 7 of the Charter.\n184. For the Respondent State, the referral of the case to the Judicial Division of the Supreme Court for the\ndetermination of the merits was only the consequence of the second appeal, which having been deemed to\nhave grounds by the Supreme Court, had recognized a second referral; and it was only natural for it to be\ninvalidated in respect of Mr. NOCA Lucio, since it became clear before the Judicial Division of the Supreme\nCourt that the second appeal which necessitated the second referral was fraudulent given that it was filed\non 3rd May,1995 on behalf of Mr. NOCA Lucio who passed away on 27 May 1992.\n185. The Commission recalls that though the complainants decided to pursue the lawsuit, they only used\nthe opportunity offered them by the Congolese State which had observed many irregularities in the\nadministration of justice in the Noca case.\n186. The right to a fair hearing is based on key elements including in particular the principle of equality of\narms for the parties to the case, whether administrative, civil, criminal or military33 , the opportunity to\nproperly prepare the defence, to present arguments and evidence and to respond to the arguments and\nevidence of the prosecution or the defendant 34 .\n187. Pursuant to Article 7.1.c of the Charter, anyone who feels that his rights have been violated has the\nright to bring his case before the relevant national courts. Thus, the position or status of the victim or those\nof the alleged perpetrator do not matter. This means that any person, whose rights have been violated,\nincluding by persons acting in their official capacity, should be entitled to an effective remedy before a\ncompetent and impartial judicial body and enjoy the right to have his case heard without any discrimination.\n188. The States Parties to the African Charter thus have a duty to ensure that the judicial organs are\naccessible to all and that all parties have the opportunity to present their defence in a fair manner.\n14\n\n\f189. The Commission notes that the title deed is an administrative act likely to be brought before the Judge\nand can constitute the object of an appeal against abuse of power if it has been fraudulently established\nother than as a result of a flaw which happened during the registration procedure.\n190. The right to be heard requires that the Complainant has unfettered access to a court having\njurisdiction to hear his case. It also requires that the matter be brought before a court having jurisdiction to\nhear the case. A competent court to hear a case in law is so empowered by the law.\n191. The Commission provided clarification on Article 7 in the Kenneth Good vs. Republic of Botswana\ncase, in which it asserted that the right to be heard requires that the Complainant should enjoy unrestricted\naccess to a court of competent jurisdiction to have his case heard 35 .\n192. The Commission believes that when the authorities put impediments in the way to prevent victims\nfrom having access to competent courts, they deprive victims of their right to have their case heard.\n193. In the case of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum vs. Zimbabwe 36 , the Commission noted that\nthe protection afforded by Article 7 is not limited to the protection of the rights of persons arrested and\ndetained but it includes the right of everyone to have access to relevant judicial bodies with jurisdiction to\nhear their case and grant them adequate compensation.\n194. The Commission regrets that after having taken the right decision to reopen the proceedings, the\nSupreme Court reversed its decision by prohibiting the NOCA party from presenting its defence and\nrejecting the resumption of proceedings by the Noca succession decided by itself and the third-party\nopposition.\n195. The Commission believes that though the Respondent State noted that the second appeal which\nprompted the second referral was fraudulent, the Supreme Court should not have rejected the pursuance of\nthe lawsuit, the only remedy available to the victim to claim his building.\n196. The Commission also believes that in such circumstances, if the Court thought it had erred in allowing\nthe NOCA party to pursue the lawsuit whereas there was an existing ruling that had acquired the force of a\njudgement delivered, and also that the second appeal was granted on the basis of a fraudulent act, it was\nobliged to re-open the proceedings in order to notify the Noca party about the facts.\n197. The Commission believes that the final judgment which rejected an obligation to reopen the\nproceedings to hear the position of Dino Noca therefore deprived him of the right to have his case heard.\n198. The Commission moreover believes that the Supreme Court did not offer the basic procedural\nsafeguards. Its decision cannot have legitimacy when both sides have not been heard with due respect for\nthe principle of equality of arms, which would have allowed the parties to discuss the issue of continuing\nwith the proceedings.\n199. In such circumstances, the Commission can only endorse the claims of the Complainant according to\nwhich the decision of the Supreme Court to exclude the NOCA party from the proceedings without giving\nhim the opportunity to present his defence and without examining the consequences of such action on his\nrequest does not comply with the requirements of the African Charter and the general principles of law.\n200. The Commission considers that the argument advanced by the Respondent State to justify the\nposition taken by its own courts is inconsistent with the obligations of the Respondent State to comply with\nArticle 7 of the Charter.\n201. The Complainant also alleges a violation of Article 3 of the Charter which deals with the right to equal\nprotection of the law and equality before the law. For the parties to a case, these rights entail access to\nequal opportunity in the preparation and presentation of their arguments. In other words, they must be able\nto defend their case before the court on an equal footing.\n202. In the Communication Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights and Institute for Human Rights and\nDevelopment in Africa vs. Republic of Zimbabwe 37 ,the African Commission relied on the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka38 , in which Chief Justice Earl Warren\nof the United States of America argued that \"equal protection by law refers to the right of everyone to have\nequal access to courts of justice and to be treated the same way by the courts, both for procedures and for\nthe essence of the law. It is akin to the right to due process of law, but applies in particular to equal\ntreatment as an element of fundamental equity\".\n203. The Commission considers that this attitude of the Supreme Court is in contradiction with the\nprinciples of the right to equality before the law and the right to defence and thus infringes Articles 3 and\n7. 1.c of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights in the sense that firstly the succession of Noca\nLucio represented by its legal liquidator Mr. Dino Noca could not present its defence and secondly the\nprinciple of equality of litigants was not respected since only the defence of the opposing party, in this case\nMr Kafwa, was taken into account.\n15\n\n\f204. In its analysis of the situation in the light of the arguments presented by the parties, the Commission\nconsiders that Articles 3, 7. 1.c and 14 of the African Charter have been violated.\n205. The Complainant finally prays the Commission to prescribe to the Respondent State to grant him, as\ncompensation for damages suffered, the minimum sum of USD 400 000, including fees paid to lawyers.\n206. The Commission, while acknowledging that the Complainant has certainly suffered damages relating\nto his right of ownership of the disputed building for several years (28 years), however notes that it is not in\npossession of sufficient facts to quantify the damages suffered.\n207. Therefore, in the name of fairness and in light of its jurisprudence39 , the Commission recommends\nthat the amount of compensation should be determined by the laws of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo.\n\nDecision of the Commission\nThe Commission:\n• Notes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo has violated the provisions of Articles 3, 7. 1.c\nand 14;\n• Declares that the transfer of the Noca family building to a third party by the State on the basis of\nrepealed texts is in violation of Article 14 of the African Charter;\n• Thus declares that Judgment RCR/C019 of 28 November 2003 is in violation of Articles 3 and 7.\n1.c of the African Charter;\n• Enjoins the DRC to restore the right to property of the beneficiaries of the late Mr Noca by\nreinstating their title deed of the disputed building, or failing that, pay them expeditious, just and fair\ncompensation;\n• Finds that the DRC should compensate without delay for the damages suffered by the Dino Noca\nfamily in accordance with the DRC laws in force;\n• Declares that the Respondent State should present within a period of 180 days, with effect from the\nnotification of this decision, a detailed report on the measures taken to implement this decision.\n\nDone in Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire, at the 52nd Ordinary Session of the African Commission on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights held from 9 to 22 October 2012.\n\n16\n\n\fFootnotes\n1 The DRC ratified the African Charter on 20 July, 1987\n2 Supporting evidence No. 1\n3 Supporting evidence No. 17-18\n4 Supporting evidence No. 19\n5 Indeed, Article 119 (4) of the old Rules of Procedure stipulates that \"States parties from whom\nexplanations or statements are sought within specified times shall be informed that if they fail to comply\nwithin those times the Commission will act on the evidence before it.\"\n6 Using as sole basis the arguments of the Complainants in the absence of arguments from the\nRespondent State, the African Commission proceeded to consider communications 155/96 Social and\nEconomic Rights Action Center, Center for Economic and Social Rights vs Nigeria and 159/96 Inter African\nHuman Rights Union, International Federation of Human Rights Leagues, African Human Rights\nEncounter, National Human Rights Organization in Senegal and the Malian Human Rights Association vs\nAngola (11th Annual Activity Report).\n7 Article 37 paragraph 1 of the Transitional Constitution of 4 April 2003.

Noumeni) / Cameroon\nSummary of Facts\n1. The complaint is lodged by the NGO, Open Society Justice Initiative, on behalf of a Cameroonian citizen,\nPius Njaw? Noumeni, against the Government of Cameroon, a state Party to the African Charter.\n2. The communication was submitted in accordance with Article 55 of the African Charter and the\nComplainant alleges that in November 1999 the Messager Group based in Douala, Cameroon, and headed\nby Mr Pius Njaw? began operating a radio station in Douala whilst an illegal decision banning the operation\nof private radio stations was in place.\n3. The Complainant maintains that following the formal liberalisation of air waves in April 2000, the\nMessager Group submitted an application with the Ministry of Communications of Cameroon for a license\nto operate a radio station. After the six (6) months period required under the law, the Ministry of\nCommunication did not respond favorably to the request arguing that the application was still being\nconsidered.\n4. The Complainant, moreover maintains that the Ministry of Communications of Cameroon was in the habit\nof processing applications for operational licenses in an arbitrary, illegal and discriminatory manner and had\non many occasions refused to grant statutory license to operators of radio stations, and on the contrary\nresorting to the practice of informally issuing temporary authorization to operate on some frequencies,\nwhich did not provide any legal cover to the operators of radio stations but only placed them in a situation of\nuncertainty since the informal authorisation could at any given time be withdrawn. In addition, the\ncomplainant maintains that by refusing to process applications for operating licenses or providing reasons\nfor refusal to grant licenses, the Ministry of Communications tends to ban, in an arbitrary, discriminatory\nand politically motivated manner existing operators from continuing to operate.\n5. Taking into consideration that the Ministry of Communications did not respond within the legally\nprescribed period to the Messager Group's request and in view of the practice of arbitrarily refusing to grant\noperating licenses for stations, the complainant further maintains that the Messager [Group] announced in\nmid May 2003 that it will begin broadcasting programs on Radio Freedom FM on 24th May 2003. But on\n23[[sup]]rd May 2003, even before Freedom FM began broadcasting, the Ministry of Communications took\nthe decision to ban the broadcasting of the said programs and the police and the army sealed the premises\nof the radio station.\n6. In September 2003, the Messager took the matter to court requesting for a break of the seals. After five\n(5) months of consecutive adjournments, the Court of First Instance of Douala decided that the matter\ncame under the competence of the Administrative Court and took 3 months to deliver a written judgment\nwhich should have enabled the Messager [Group] to appeal. Whilst the Court of Appeal should be\nconsidering this appeal, equipments worth $110,000 continue to daily depreciate because of inadequate\nstorage conditions.\n7. As the procedure in the civil court followed its course, the Ministry of Communications took Mr Pius\nNjaw? and the Messager Group to court for having 'set up and operated' without a license a radio\nbroadcasting company.\n\nComplaint\n8. The Complainant maintains that the facts stated above constitute a violation by Cameroon of Articles 1,\n2, 9, 14 of the African Charter and consequently request the African Commission to consider as such and\nrequest Cameroon to pay adequate compensation to the victims for multiple violations of their rights and\nfreedoms.\n9. The Complainant moreover, requests the African Commission, in accordance with Article 111 of its Rules\nof Procedure to request Cameroon to adopt provisional measures with a view to:\n1. immediately lifting the ban affecting the programs of Freedom FM and authorise it to operate whilst\nawaiting the outcome of the African Commission's decision on the complaint;\n\n1\n\n\f2. break the seal on the premises of Freedom FM so that the equipments could undergo proper\nmaintenance whilst awaiting the African Commission's decision on the complaint;\n3. undertake a quick review of the legislative framework and administrative practices on issuing\nlicenses for operating radio stations with a view to harmonizing them with the provisions of Article 9\nof the African Charter and the 2002 Declaration of Principles.\n\nProcedure\n10. The complaint was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 28th June 2004.\n11. By a letter ref. ACHPR/COMM 290/2004/RK addressed to the complainant, the Secretariat of the\nAfrican Commission acknowledged receipt of this communication on 5th July 2004 and indicated that the\nseizure of the complaint will be considered by the African Commission at its 36th Ordinary Session (23rd\nNovember to 7th December 2004, Dakar, Senegal).\n12. By a letter ref. ACHPR/GOV/COMM/3/RK of 15th July 2004, the Chairperson of the African Commission\nsent an urgent request for the adoption of provisional measures in accordance with the provisions of Article\n111 of the African Commission's Rules of Procedure, to H.E Mr Paul Biya, President of the Republic of\nCameroon requesting that provisional measures be taken to ensure that no irreparable damage is done to\nthe equipment of Radio Freedom FM.\n13. By a letter of 16th November 2004, the Complainant informed the Chairperson of the African\nCommission, Commissioner Sawadogo, that the request for provisional measures had not been complied\nwith and that further the Complainant had received death threats over the matter.\n14. During the 36th Ordinary Session held in Dakar, Senegal, from 23rd November to 7th December 2004,\nthe African Commission considered the communication and decided to be seized of it. The Complainants\nmade oral submissions on the failure of the State to comply with the request for provisional measure. The\nState delegates indicated that they ha[d] not been made aware of the request and the head of delegation,\nMinister Joseph Dion Ngute offered his good offices with a view to facilitating an amicable solution of the\nmatter.\n15. On 22nd December 2004, the Secretariat informed the parties that the African Commission had been\nseized of the communication and requested them to submit arguments on admissibility in three months\nfrom the date of notification.\n16. On 22nd February 2005, the Secretariat reminded the State through a Note Verbale to submit its\narguments on admissibility within one month from the date of the reminder.\n17. On 22nd March 2005, the Complainant submitted further arguments on admissibility, which were\ntransmitted to the Respondent State on 29th March 2005 through the Embassy of the Respondent State.\n18. At its 37th Ordinary Session, which was held from 27th April to 11th May 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia,\nthe African Commission considered the case and heard oral submissions from the parties. The African\nCommission subsequently deferred its decision on admissibility of the case pending receipt of arguments of\nthe Respondent State on the same.\n19. On 8th December 2005, the Respondent State sent to the Secretariat a letter informing it that amicable\nsettlement was underway in the matter.\n20. On 4th October 2005, the Secretariat informed the Complainant of the above letter and forwarded the\nattached documentation and requested them to send in their comments on the same.\n21. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from the 21st November to 5th December 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia,\nthe African Commission deferred its decision on the matter awaiting for comments of the Complainant on\nthe outcome of the said amicable settlement.\n22. On 28th April 2006, the Secretariat received a note from the Complainant informing it that:\n1. the Government of Cameroon [had] dropped the criminal charges against the Freedom FM director\nand released the equipment of the Radio;\n2. the Government committed itself to grant Radio Freedom FM a provisional authorization to\nbroadcast, and process its application for a full license in a fair and equitable manner;\n3. Freedom FM, for its part, agreed to discontinue the communication before the Commission, and\nsettle the case;\n\n2\n\n\f4. the ongoing negotiations between the parties on the compensation issue have now produced a\nmutually acceptable compromise, with the Government of Cameroon agreeing to re-open the\ndiscussions with Radio Freedom FM in relation to the compensation of the damages suffered by the\nradio, with a view to reaching a fair, comprehensive and final settlement of the case; and\n5. the Government has reiterated its commitment to grant Freedom FM a provisional authorization as\nsoon as consideration of the current communication is discontinued - as well as process the Radio's\napplication for a broadcasting license in a fair, transparent, and expeditious manner.\n23. In consideration of the above, the Open Society Justice Initiative, acting on behalf of Mr Pius Njaw? and\nGroup Le Messager, requested the African Commission to discontinue the consideration of communication\n290/04 against the Republic of Cameroon and the amicable settlement be registered in its lieu.\n24. At its 39th Ordinary session held from 11th to 25th May 2006 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission considered the communication and decided to close the file.\n\nHolding\n\nThe African Commission takes note of the above request and decides to close the file.\n\nThe African Commission also requests the parties to forward to the Secretariat the written copy of the said\namicable settlement for inclusion in the file.\n\nDone at the 39th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 11th to 25th May 2006.\n\n3\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"8","date":"May 25, 2006","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"Freedom of expression, Freedom of opinion, Property rights","activity_report":"20th Activity Report: Jan 2006 - Jun 2006","outcome":"2"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080c48d8","title":"Anuak Justice Council / Ethiopia","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559456206,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"299_05 Anuak Justice Council _ Ethiopia.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463559457267jvw5i5ywxchgds4i.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463559457267jvw5i5ywxchgds4i.pdf","size":47151},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"299/05 Anuak Justice Council / Ethiopia\nSummary of Facts\n1. The communication is submitted by the Anuak Justice Council, through Obang Metho the Director for\nInternational Advocacy, Anuak Justice Council which was prepared by the International Human Rights\nClinic, Washington College of Law, in Washington D.C., the United States of America against the Federal\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Respondent State, a party to the African Charter since 1998.\n2. The Complainant avers that the Respondent through its agents, the Ethiopian Defence Forces has been\nengaged in massive discrimination resulting in serious human rights abuses and violations of the people of\nAnuak ethnicity. They claim that the abuses by the Ethiopian Defence Forces include the massacre of over\nfour hundred and twenty-four (424) civilians, the wounding of over two hundred (200) civilians and the\ndisappearance of over eighty-five (85) civilians in the Gambella region in the three day period of 13th to 15th\nDecember 2003. The Complainant states that the abuses have continued against the Anuak since that\nperiod including extrajudicial killing, torture, detention, rape and property destruction throughout the\nGambella region resulting in one thousand (1000) Anuak deaths and that, over fifty-one thousand (51,000)\nAnuak have been displaced within the Gambella region.\n3. The Complainant adds, that the Republic of Ethiopia has violated its legal obligations to uphold the rights\nand principles of all Ethiopian citizens, and has violated its obligation to uphold the rights and protections\nenshrined in the African Charter under Articles 4, 5, 6, 12, 14 and 18.\n4. The Anuak Justice Council requests the African Commission to grant provisional measures Rule 11 and\ndeclare them binding on the Ethiopian government.\n5. The Complainant states that the Anuak are an indigenous minority group living in south-western\nGambella region of Ethiopia and that despite their dominance in the region, the Ethiopian government has\na long history of marginalising, excluding and discriminating against them. The Complainant claims that due\nto Gambella's natural resources, the Ethiopian government has resettled over sixty thousand (60,000)\nhighlanders, who had almost completely destroyed the Anuak way of life within Gambella.\n6. The Complainant avers that the Anuak believe that oil in the region should belong to them, while the\nFederal Government argues that under the Federal Constitution all mineral resources belong to the\nEthiopian State. The complainant adds that the Ethiopian Defence Forces are stationed throughout the\nGambella in order to identify and destroy disparate groups of armed Anuak known collectively as shifta that\nhave attacked highlander civilians.\n7. The Complainant submits that the December 2003 massacre was sparked by the killing of eight (8)\nhighlander refugee camp officials and propelled the Ethiopian Defence Forces into a broad-based assault\non Gambella's Anuak community. The Complainant states that despite the fact that nobody was\nimmediately found responsible for the death of the eight people, there is no indication that the Ethiopian\ngovernment had undertaken an official investigation into the ambush of the refugee camp officials thus\nblaming the Anuak community for the attacks.\n8. The Complainant avers that the violence in the Gambella region has continued since December 2003\nand remains a serious threat to Anuak citizens as well as other ethnic groups in the region. The\nComplainant allege that the Ethiopian Defence Forces search for shifta has become the pretext for bloody\nand destructive raids on numerous Anuak villages since the December 2003 massacre on the Gambella\ntown. The Complainant further allege[s] that unarmed Anuak within Gambella are currently being killed by\nEthiopian Defence Forces without due process or the use of judicial proceedings without even making an\neffort to distinguish Anuak civilians from the shifta they claim to be looking for.\n9. The Complainant further allege[s] that many Anuak have been detained in prison without charge both in\nGambella and Addis Ababa which accounts to about one thousand (1000) detained to this day. The\nComplainant also adds that a substantial group of Gambella's educated Anuak have been imprisoned or\nforced into exile and that many have been charged with offences relating to alleged collaboration with\nAnuak insurgents and put on trial but none of the leaders are yet to be convicted.\n10. The Complainant further alleged that in rural areas the Ethiopian military continues to burn homes,\ndestroy crops, burn food stores, disrupt planting cycles, and destroy agricultural equipment of the Anuak to\nprevent them from sustaining themselves. The Complainant asserts that as recently as January 2005 the\nEthiopian government threatened Anuak elders in Gambella that anyone attempting to tarnish the\nreputation of the Ethiopian government over the massacres would be dealt with.\n1\n\n\f11. The Complainant claims that the Ethiopian government's response to the December massacre has\nbeen grossly inadequate and disingenuous. The Complainant states that the government's initial position\nthat no soldiers had taken part in the massacre had become impossible to defend and adds that the\nCommission of Inquiry set up by the Government was biased and ineffectual and did not investigate the\nbehaviour of the Ethiopian Defence Forces as an organisation despite numerous reports.\n\nComplaint\n12. The Complainant states that crimes against humanity, such as extrajudicial killing, torture, and rape,\ncrimes that take place against the Anuak civilians is in violation of international law as well as a violation of\nArticles 4, 5, 6, 12,14 and 18 of the African Charter. The Anuak Justice Council urges the African\nCommission to intervene to prevent further human rights abuses of the Anuak by the Ethiopian\ngovernment.\n13. The Comp[lainant] further makes an urgent request for provisional measures under Rule 111 of the\nRules of Procedure of the African Charter [sic] that the African Commission may intervene to \"avoid\nirreparable damage being caused to the victim of the alleged violation\".\nRequest for provisional measures - summary\n\n14. The Complainant, requests for provisional measures to the African Commission pursuant to Rule 111 of\nthe Rules of Procedures of the Commission. The complaint relates to the alleged actions of the Defence\nForces of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. These actions according to the Complainant reveal\na pattern of serious and massive human and peoples' rights violations by the Ethiopian Defence Forces.\nThat, bound by the African Charter, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, has and continues to\nviolate Articles 4, 5, 6, 12, 14 and 18 of the African Charter.\n15. The Anuak Justice Council therefore seeks the [African] Commission's intervention and issuance of\nProvisional Measures requesting that the Ethiopian government stops the human rights abuses of the\nAnuak pending a decision of the African Commission on the concurrent communication and is also seeking\nan in-depth study of the treatment of the Anuak by the African Commission pursuant to Article 58 of the\nCharter.\n16. The Anuak Justice Council notes that it does not request the [African] Commission to evaluate the\nmerits of this case rather, in this provisional measures submission, the Anuak Justice Council merely asks\nthat the [African] Commission request that the Ethiopian government immediately stops the series of\nserious and massive violations of human and peoples' rights of the Anuak people prior to the issuance of a\ndecision by the African Commission on the merits.\n17. That the [African] Commission has jurisdiction to issue provisional measures under Rule 111 of the\nRules of Procedure of the African Charter [sic], see Registered Trustees of the Constitutional Rights Project\nv. the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Five Others[sic]. Similar to the Nigeria case, many\nAnuak have also been, and continue to be, sentenced to death. The [African] Commission should therefore\nfind the Anuak situation as even more sever[e] and compelling than the Nigeria case and grant provisional\nmeasures.\n18. The Complainant notes further that while the African Commission has not decided whether grants of\nprovisional measures should be binding on State Parties, other international and regional human rights\nbodies have declared that provisional measures be binding on States including the European Court of\nHuman Rights, Inter-American Commission, the International Court of Justice and the UN Human Rights\nCommittee. Due to the severity of the situation that the Anuak find themselves subject to in the Gambella,\nin prisons throughout Ethiopia and as refugees in Sudan and Kenya, petitioners plead that the African\nCommission grant provisional measures and declare them binding on the Ethiopian government.\n19. The Complainant seeks the [African] Commission's intervention and issuance of provisional measures\nrequesting that the Ethiopian government stop human rights abuses of the Anuak, pending the decision of\nthis Commission on the Anuak Justice Council's concurrent communication to the African Commission on\nthe merits of this claim and further urges the Commission to find that its order of provisional measures in\nthis case be binding upon the Ethiopian government.\n\n2\n\n\fProcedure\n20. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 4th April 2005.\n21. By letter of 20th April 2005 the Secretariat acknowledged receipt thereof informing the Complainant that\nthe communication has been registered as communication 299/05 - Anuak Justice Council/Ethiopia and\nthat the communication will be considered on seizure at the 37th Ordinary Session of the African\nCommission.\n22. At its 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 27th April to 11th May 2005, the African\nCommission considered the communication and decided to be seized thereof.\n23. By Note Verbale of 24th May 2005 the Secretariat of the African Commission notified the State of the\nAfrican Commission's decision and forwarded the complaint to the State with a request for the latter to\nmake its submission on the merits within three months of the notification. By letter of 24th May 2005, the\nSecretariat of the African Commission informed the Complainant of the African Commission's decision.\n24. On 23rd August 2005, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submissions on admissibility.\n25. On 25th August 2005, the Secretariat transmitted the Respondent State's submission on admissibility to\nthe Complainant, requesting the latter to respond thereto before 25th September.\n26. On 21 [sic] complainant wrote to the Secretariat informing the latter that the legal representative of the\nAnuak Justice Council had changed adding that they received the Secretariat's letter of 25th August only on\n9th September and would like the deadline for the submission of their arguments on admissibility to be\nmoved to 9th October 2005. The Complainant also requested for provisional measures to be taken by the\nAfrican Commission.\n27. On 10th October 2005, the Secretariat received the Complainant's response on the Respondent State's\nsubmissions on admissibility.\n28. On 19th October 2005, the Secretariat transmitted the Complainant's response to the Respondent State\nwith a request to the latter to make its comments, if any, before 31st October 2005.\n29. At its 38th Ordinary Session, the African Commission deferred consideration on the admissibility of the\ncommunication and to enable the Secretariat get additional information from the parties.\n30. By Note Verbale of 19th January 2006 and by letter of the same date, the Secretariat of the African\nCommission notified the parties of the African Commission's decision.\n31. At its 39th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia from 11th to 25th May 2006, the African\nCommission considered the communication and decided to declare it inadmissible.\n32. By Note Verbale of 29th May 2006 and by letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the\nAfrican Commission's decision.\nComplainant's submission on admissibility\n\n33. The Complainant submits that Article 56(5) of the African Charter requires that complainants exhaust\ndomestic remedies before a case is considered by the African Commission. The Complainant notes further\nthat if the potential domestic remedies are unavailable or unduly prolonged, the Commission may\nnevertheless consider a communication, adding that this is especially true when the country against which\nthe complaint is lodged has committed vast and varied scope of violations and the general situation in the\ncountry is such that domestic exhaustion would be futile.\n34. The Complainant argue that in the Anuak Justice Council case, pursuing domestic remedies would be\nfutile due to the lack of an independent and impartial judiciary, a lack of an efficient remedy, the significant\nlikelihood of an unduly prolonged domestic remedy, and most importantly, the potential for violence against\nthe Anuak or those supporting them within the legal system.\n35. Anuak Justice Council alleges that it cannot seek exhaustion of domestic remedies because of its\ninability to receive an independent and fair hearing, as a direct consequence of the fact that the aggressor\nis the government of Ethiopia. The Complainant notes that in spite the protection in Article 78\n×\n1. An independent judiciary is established by this Constitution.\n2. Supreme Federal judicial authority is vested in the Federal Supreme Court. The House of Peoples'\nRepresentatives may, by two-thirds majority vote, establish nationwide, or in some parts of the country\nonly, the Federal High Court and First-Instance Courts it deems necessary. Unless decided in this manner,\n3\n\n\fthe jurisdictions of the Federal High Court and of the First-Instance Courts are hereby delegated to the\nState courts.\n3. States shall establish State Supreme, High and First-Instance Courts. Particulars shall be determined by\nlaw.\n4. Special or ad hoc courts which take judicial powers away form the regular courts or institutions legally\nempowered to exercise judicial functions and which do not follow legally prescribed procedures shall not be\nestablished.\n5. Pursuant to sub-Article 5 of Article 34 the House of Peoples' Representatives and State Councils can\nestablish or give official recognition to religious and customary courts. Religious and customary courts that\nhad state recognition and functioned prior to the adoption of the Constitution shall be organised on the\nbasis of recognition accorded to them by this Constitution.\nof the Respondent State's Constitution guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary, it is perceived by\nindividuals both at home and abroad that the executive has considerable and even undue influence on the\njudiciary.\n36. The Complainant quoted a World Bank Report entitled Ethiopia: Legal and Judicial Sector Assessment\n(2004) which concluded that \"... of the three branches of government, the judiciary has the least history and\nexperience of independence and therefore requires significant strengthening to obtain true independence\".\nAccording to the Complainant, the Report notes that the interference in the judiciary is more flagrant at\nState level where there are reports of administrative officers interfering with court decisions, firing judges,\ndictating decisions to judges, reducing salaries of judges and deliberately refusing to enforce certain\ndecisions of the courts.\n37. The Complainant also alleges that bringing the case before Ethiopian courts would unduly prolong the\nprocess as the Ethiopian judiciary suffers from a complex system of multiple courts that lack coordination\nand resources, including \"dismal conditions of service, staff shortages, lack of adequate training,\ndebilitating infrastructure and logistical problems\". The Complainant claims court proceedings take years to\nyield results, and concluded that the Respondent State's judicial system is so under resourced that\nprosecutions would be nearly impossible, noting that to date, no action had been taken to prosecute any of\nthe Ethiopian Defence Forces or government officials for the atrocities they committed against the Anuak.\n38. The Complainant also alleges that the Anuak fear for their safety in bringing the case in Ethiopia adding\nthat there are no Anuak trained as lawyers who could bring the case before Ethiopian courts. The\nComplainant notes that the overwhelming sentiment in the Gambella Region and of the Anuak who have\nfled the country is that non-Anuak lawyers within Ethiopia would be unwilling to take the case due to the\npotential persecution they would face, as well as the insurmountable odds of achieving a just remedy. The\nComplainant added that Anuak who remain in the Gambella Region continue to suffer from extra-judicial\nexecutions, torture, rape and arbitrary detention from the authorities of the Respondent State adding that\nseveral of them have been threatened and warned specifically against pursuing a case against the\nRespondent State. The Complainant noted that as recently as January 2005, the Respondent State\nthreatened Anuak leaders, declaring that anyone attempting to tarnish the reputation of the Respondent\nState would be dealt with. The Complainant concluded by stating that to bring the case within the\nRespondent State would only further endanger the lives of the remaining Anuak in the Ethiopia.\n39. The Complainant added that the Respondent State had been given notice and adequate time to\nremedy the human rights violations against the Anuak but has utterly failed to do so. That the Respondent\nState received notice of the violations but chose not to take action to halt the atrocities or to make its forces\naccountable. The Complainant added that the Respondent State's response to the massacres in December\n2003 in the Gambella Region was inadequate and disingenuous. That under international pressure, the\nRespondent State established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the killings, however, according to the\nComplainant, the inquiry was biased and ineffectual and did not meet international standards of an\nindependent investigation.\n\n4\n\n\fRespondent State's submissions on admissibility\n\n40. The Respondent State claims that the cases of those involved in the alleged violations that took place\nin the Gambella Region are currently pending before the Federal Circuiting Court and the Respondent,\ntherefore, argued that domestic remedies have not yet been exhausted. The State provided a list of about\nnine such cases including their file numbers and previous and future dates of adjournments.\n41. The Respondent State argues that the rule that local remedies be exhausted is not limited to individuals\nand also applies to organisations, including those in no way subject to the jurisdiction of the Respondent\nState. According to the Respondent, the Complainant could have sought redress from the domestic courts,\nthe Judicial Administration Office, the Commission of Inquiry or the Human Rights Commission but did not.\nThe Complainant has not, argued the State, shown the existence of any impediment to the use of these\nremedial processes or that such were unduly long.\n42. Without indicating the status of the proceedings, the State argued that all those alleged of human rights\noffences associated with the Gambella incident of December 2003 were brought before the Federal Circuit\nCourt. The State indicated that three domestic remedies were available to the Complainants: the competent\ncourts, the Judicial Administration Officer and the Human Rights Commission but the Complainants failed\nto approach any of them.\nProvisional measures\n43. The Republic of Ethiopia argues that the Complainant has sought only to present what it claims is prima\nfacie evidence of violations and has not shown that if such alleged violations continue there will be\n'irreparable injury', as required. Finally, the Respondent submits that the Government has presented\nsufficient evidence that it has taken adequate measures to rectify the situation and that the situation in\ngeneral has stabilised and does not warrant any provisional measures from the African Commission. The\nRespondent State submits as follows:\n• In February 2004, the Office of the Prime Minister issued instructions to Federal institutions to assist\nthe Regional Administration in safeguarding the security of the people and institutions and\npreventing further violence; soliciting the support of elders, the youth and civil servants in the effort\ntowards sustainable peace, democracy and development; rehabilitating victims of the violence and\ninternally displaced people; and bringing to justice those responsible for committing the violence\nand the destruction of property.\n• The Defence Forces, once deployed, protected the civilian population and allowed humanitarian\nassistance and rehabilitation.\n• The Federal Government, in cooperation with international agencies, coordinated humanitarian\nassistance to alleviate the suffering of the victims of violence and the displaced.\n• A Commission of Inquiry has been established to investigate the circumstances surrounding the\ncrisis; charges have been filed against several individuals as a result.\n• The Government has organised various consultations and workshops with the participation of the\nlocal population which have proposed concrete solutions aimed at resolving the problems facing the\nregion and have identified the root causes of the crisis.\n• The Federal Police have recently graduated more than three hundred police officers from the\nGambella region to aid in maintaining law and order in the region once the situation has stabilised.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n44. The current communication is submitted pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter which allows the\nAfrican Commission to receive and consider communications, other than from States Parties. Article 56 of\nthe African Charter provides that the admissibility of a communication submitted pursuant to Article 55 is\nsubject to seven (7) conditions. The African Commission has stressed that the conditions laid down in\nArticle 56 are conjunctive, meaning that if any one of them is absent, the communication will be declared\n5\n\n\finadmissible.\n45. The Complainant in the present communication argued that it has satisfied the admissibility conditions\nset out in Article 56 of the African Charter and as such, the communication should be declared admissible.\nThe Respondent State on the other hand submitted that the communication should be declared\ninadmissible because, according to the State, the Complainant has not complied with Article 56(5) of the\nAfrican Charter. As there seems to be agreement by both parties as to the fulfillment of the other\nrequirements under Article 56, this Commission will not make any pronouncements thereof.\n46. Article 56(5) of the African Charter provides that communications relating to human and peoples' rights\nshall be considered if they: \"[a]re sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this\nprocedure is unduly prolonged\".\n47. Human rights law regards it as supremely important for a person whose rights have been violated to\nmake use of domestic remedies to right the wrong, rather than address the issue to an international\ntribunal. The rule is founded on the premise that the full and effective implementation of international\nobligations in the field of human rights is designed to enhance the enjoyment of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms at the national level. In Free Legal Assistance Group, Lawyers' Committee for\nHuman Rights, Union Interafricaine des Droits de l'Homme, Les Témoins de Jehovah / DRC, Paragraph 36\nand Rencontre Africaine pour la Défense des Droits de l'Homme (RADDHO) / Zambia, Paragraph 11, this\nCommission held that \"a government should have notice of a human rights violation in order to have the\nopportunity to remedy such violations before being called before an international body.\" 1 Such an\nopportunity will enable the accused state to save its reputation, which would be inevitably tarnished if it\nwere brought before an international jurisdiction.\n48. The rule also reinforces the subsidiary and complementary relationship of the international system to\nsystems of internal protection. To the extent possible, an international tribunal, including this Commission,\nshould be prevented from playing the role of a court of first instance, a role that it cannot under any\ncircumstances arrogate to itself. Access to an international organ should be available, but only as a last\nresort; after the domestic remedies have been exhausted and have failed. Moreover, local remedies are\nnormally quicker, cheaper, and more effective than international ones. They can be more effective in the\nsense that an appellate court can reverse the decision of a lower court, whereas the decision of an\ninternational organ does not have that effect, although it will engage the international responsibility of the\nstate concerned.\n49. The African Charter states that this African Commission shall consider a communication after the\napplicant has exhausted local remedies, \"if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly\nprolonged\". The Charter thus recognises that, though the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies is a\nconventional provision, it should not constitute an unjustifiable impediment to access to international\nremedies. This Commission has also held that Article 56(5) \"must be applied concomitantly with Article 7,\nwhich establishes and protects the right to fair trial\". th 2 In interpreting the rule, the African Commission\nappears to take into consideration the circumstances of each case, including the general context in which\nthe formal remedies operate and the personal circumstances of the applicant. Its interpretation of the local\nremedies criteri[ion] can therefore not be understood without some knowledge of that general context.\n50. A local remedy has been defined as \"any domestic legal action that may lead to the resolution of the\ncomplaint at the local or national level.\" 3 The Rules of Procedure of the African Commission provide that\n\"[t]he Commission shall determine questions of admissibility pursuant to Article 56 of the Charter\" 4\nGenerally, the rules require applicants to set out in their applications the steps taken to exhaust domestic\nremedies. They must provide some prima facie evidence of an attempt to exhaust local remedies.5\nAccording to the African Commission's guidelines on the submission of communications, applicants are\nexpected to indicate, for instance, the courts where they sought domestic remedies. Applicants must\nindicate that they have had recourse to all domestic remedies to no avail and must supply evidence to that\neffect. If they were unable to use such remedies, they must explain why. They could do so by submitting\nevidence derived from analogous situations or testifying to a state policy of denying such recourse.\n51. In the jurisprudence of this Commission, three major criteria could be deduced in determining the rule\non the exhaustion of local remedies, namely: that the remedy must be available, effective and sufficient. 6\nAccording to this Commission, a remedy is considered to be available if the petitioner can pursue it without\nimpediments 7 or if he can make use of it in the circumstances of his case.8 The word 'available' means\n'readily obtainable; accessible'; or 'attainable, reachable; on call, on hand, ready, present; . . . convenient,\nat one's service, at one's command, at one's disposal, at one's beck and call'.9 In other words, \"remedies,\nthe availability of which is not evident, cannot be invoked by the State to the detriment of the Complainant.\"\n6\n\n\f10\n\n52. A remedy will be deemed to be effective if it offers a prospect of success. 11 If its success is not\nsufficiently certain, it will not meet the requirements of availability and effectiveness. The word 'effective'\nhas been defined to mean \"adequate to accomplish a purpose; producing the intended or expected result,\"\nor \"functioning, useful, serviceable, operative, in order; practical, current, actual, real, valid\".12 Lastly, a\nremedy will be found to be sufficient if it is capable of redressing the complaint.13 It will be deemed\ninsufficient if, for example, the applicant cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of a generalised\nfear for his life \"or even those of his relatives.\"14 This Commission has also declared a remedy to be\ninsufficient because its pursuit depended on extrajudicial considerations, such as discretion or some\nextraordinary power vested in an executive state official. The word 'sufficient' literally means \"adequate for\nthe purpose; enough\"; or \"ample, abundant; . . . satisfactory.\"15\n53. In the present communication, the author of the communication is based in Canada, alleging human\nrights violations in the Respondent State following an incident that occurred in the country. The\nComplainant does not hide the fact that local remedies were not attempted but argued that pursuing\ndomestic remedies in the Respondent State would be futile \"due to the lack of an independent and impartial\njudiciary, a lack of an efficient remedy, the significant likelihood of an unduly prolonged domestic remedy,\nand most importantly, the potential for violence against the Anuak or those supporting them within the legal\nsystem\". The Complainant argued that the violations that took place in Gambella were massive and serious\nand involved many people; it noted that \"the government forces and its collaborators, having previously\ndrawn a list of targets, went from door to door, slaughtering any educated Anuak men they could find,\nwomen and children were raped, and homes and schools were burnt to the ground...\".\n54. The Complainant noted further that the judiciary in the Respondent State is not independent due to\ninterference at State level where there are reports of administrative officers interfering with court decisions,\nfiring of judges, dictating decisions to judges, reducing salaries of judges and deliberately refusing to\nenforce certain decisions of the courts; and that bringing the case before Ethiopian courts would be unduly\nprolonging the process as the Ethiopian judiciary suffers from \"a complex system of multiple courts that lack\ncoordination and resources\", including \"dismal conditions of service, staff shortages, lack of adequate\ntraining, debilitating infrastructure and logistical problems\". The Complainant claims court proceedings\n\"take years to yield results\", and concluded that the Respondent State's judicial system is \"so under\nresourced that prosecutions would be nearly impossible\".\n55. The Complainant also alleges that the Anuak fear for their safety in bringing the case in Ethiopia adding\nthat there are no Anuak trained as lawyers who could bring the case before Ethiopian courts. The\nComplainant concluded by stating that to bring the case within the Respondent State would only further\nendanger the lives of the remaining Anuak in the Ethiopia. The Complainant added that the Respondent\nState had been given notice and adequate time to remedy the human rights violations against the Anuak\nbut has utterly failed to do so.\n56. Can this Commission conclude, based on the above allegations by the complainant that local remedies\nin the Respondent State are not available, ineffective or insufficient?\n57. It must be observed here that the Complainant's submissions seem to suggest that local remedies may\nin fact be available but it is apprehensive about their effectiveness as far as the present case is concerned.\nFrom the Complainant's submissions, it is clear that the Complainant has relied on reports, including a\nWorld Bank report which concluded that \"of the three branches of government, the judiciary has the least\nhistory and experience of independence and therefore requires significant strengthening to obtain true\nindependence\".\n58. The Complainant's submissions also demonstrate that it is apprehensive about the success of local\nremedies either because of fear for the safety of lawyers, the lack of independence of the judiciary or the\nmeagre resources available to the judiciary. Apart from casting aspersions on the effectiveness of local\nremedies, the Complainant has not provided concrete evidence or demonstrated sufficiently that these\napprehensions are founded and may constituted [sic] a barrier to it attempting local remedies. In the view of\nthis Commission, the Complainant is simply casting doubts about the effectiveness of the domestic\nremedies. This Commission is of the view that it is incumbent on every complainant to take all necessary\nsteps to exhaust, or at least attempt the exhaustion of, local remedies. It is not enough for the complainant\nto cast aspersion on the ability of the domestic remedies of the State due to isolated or past incidences. In\nthis regard, the African Commission would like to refer to the decision of the [UN] Human Rights Committee\nin A v. Australia16 in which the Committee held that \"mere doubts about the effectiveness of local remedies\n... did not absolve the author from pursuing such remedies\".17 The African Commission can therefore not\n7\n\n\fdeclare the communication admissible based on this argument. If a remedy has the slightest likelihood to\nbe effective, the applicant must pursue it. Arguing that local remedies are not likely to be successful,\nwithout trying to avail oneself of them, will simply not sway this Commission.\n59. The Complainant also argue[s] that the violations alleged are serious and involve a large number of\npeople and should be declare admissible as the African Commission cannot hold the requirements of local\nremedies to apply literally in cases where it is impracticable or undesirable for the Complainant to seize the\ndomestic courts in the case of each violation. In the 54.91-61.91-98.93-164.97_196.97-210.98 case18 , for\nexample, this Commission observed that [t]he gravity of the human rights situation in Mauritania and the\ngreat number of victims involved render[ed] the channels of remedy unavailable in practical terms, and,\naccording to the terms of the Charter, their process [was] 'unduly prolonged'. In like manner, the Amnesty\nInternational, Comité Loosli Bachelard, Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, Association of Members of\nthe Episcopal Conference of East Africa / Sudan, Paragraph 32 case 19 involved the arbitrary arrest,\ndetention and torture of many Sudanese citizens after the coup of 30th July 1989. The alleged acts of\ntorture included forcing detainees into cells measuring 1.8 metres wide and 1 metre deep, deliberately\nflooding the cells, frequently banging on the doors to prevent detainees from lying down, forcing them to\nface mock executions, and prohibiting them from bathing or washing. Other acts of torture included burning\ndetainees with cigarettes, binding them with ropes to cut off circulation, and beating them with sticks until\ntheir bodies were severely lacerated and then treating the resulting wounds with acid. After the coup, the\nSudanese government promulgated a decree that suspended the jurisdiction of the regular courts in favour\nof special tribunals with respect to any action taken in applying the decree. It also outlawed the taking of\nany legal action against the decree. These measures, plus the \"seriousness of the human rights situation in\nSudan and the great numbers of people involved,\" the Commission concluded, \"render[ed] such remedies\nunavailable in fact.\" 20\n60. Thus, in cases of massive violations, the state will be presumed to have notice of the violations within\nits territory and the State is expected to act accordingly to deal with whatever human rights violations. The\npervasiveness of these violations dispenses with the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies,\nespecially where the state took no steps to prevent or stop them. 21\n61. The above cases must however be distinguished from the present case which involves one single\nincident that took place for a short period of time. The Respondent State has indicated the measures it took\nto deal with the situation and the legal proceedings being undertaken by those alleged to have committed\nhuman rights violations during the incident. By establishing the Gambella Commission of Inquiry and\nindicting alleged human rights perpetrators, the state, albeit under international pressure, demonstrated\nthat it was not indifferent to the alleged human rights violations that took place in the area and in the view of\nthis Commission could be said to have exercised due diligence.\n62. This Commission has also held in many instances that domestic remedies have not been exhausted if a\ncase that includes the subject matter of the petition before it is still pending before the national courts. In\n45.90, 22 the African Commission declined to consider a communication with respect to which a claim had\nbeen filed but not yet settled by the courts of the Respondent State. In the present communication, the\nRespondent State indicates that the matter is still pending before its courts and attached a list of cases still\npending before the Federal Circuit Court in relation with the Gambella incident. The list provided the names\nof the suspects, file number of their cases, previous and future dates of adjournments. The Complainant\ndoes not deny this process is going on. In the view of this Commission, it does not matter whether the\ncases still pending before the courts have been brought by the Complainant or the state. The underlying\nquestion is whether the case is a subject matter of the proceedings before the African Commission and\nwhether it is aimed at granting the same relief the Complainant is seeking before this Commission. As long\nas a case still pending before a domestic court is a subject matter of the petition before this Commission,\nand as long as this Commission believes the relief sought can be obtained locally, it will decline to entertain\nthe case. It is the view of this Commission that the present communication23 is still pending before the\ncourts of the Respondent State and therefore does not meet the requirements under Article 56(5).\n\nHolding\n\nFor the above reasons, the African Commission declares communication 299/05 Anuak Justice\n8\n\n\fCouncil/Ethiopia inadmissible for non-exhaustion of local remedies in conformity with Article 56(5)\nof the African Charter.\n\nFootnotes\n1 See communications 25/89, 47/90, 56/91, 100/93 Free Legal Assistance Group et al./Zaire, para. 36,\n1995 and communication 71/92 Rencontre africaine pour la défense des droits de l'Homme/Zambia, para.\n11.\n2 consolidated communication 48/90, 50/91, 89/93 Amnesty International [et] al./Sudan, para. 31.\n3 See communication 60/91 Constitutional Rights Project/Nigeria.\n4 Rule 116 of the [African] Commission's Rules of Procedures.\n5 communication 86/93 Ceesay/The Gambia.\n6 Consolidated communications 147/95, 149/96 Jawara/The Gambia, para. 31.\n7 Ibid, para. 32.\n8 Ibid, para 33.\n9 Longman Synonym Dictionary, 82 (1986).\n10 Consolidated communications 147/95, 149/96 Jawara/The Gambia supra, para. 33.\n11 Ibid, para. 32.\n12 Longman Synonym Dictionary, 82 (1986).\n13 Consolidated communications 147/95-149/96 Jawara/The Gambia, para. 32.\n14 Ibid, para 35.\n15 Longman, p. 1183.\n16 Communication 560/1993, UN Doc CCPR/C/59/D/560/1993 (1997).\n17 See also L.

Ethiopia\nSummary of the Facts\n1. The present Communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission (the Secretariat)\non 16 November 2004. It is submitted pursuant to Article 55 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples'\nRights (the African Charter or Charter). The Secretariat later received a letter from the Institute for Human\nRights and Development in Africa (hereafter the IHRDA) dated 29th March 2006, whereby the IHRDA\nsought to join as co-author of the communication.\n2. The Complaint is thus submitted by Haregewoin Gabre-Salassie and IHRDA (the Complainants) on\nbehalf of \"the Dergue officials\" former officials of the Mengistu regime in Ethiopia) who have been detained\nby the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (Respondent State) since 1991.\n3. The complainants alleged that following the overthrow of the former Mengistu regime in Ethiopia\n(commonly referred to as Dergue regime) by the Ethiopia People's Revolutionary Democratic Front\n(EPRDF), in 1991, the Dergue officials surrendered to the new government and they were arrested and\ndetained on account of collective responsibility for policies or abuses by the Dergue regime rather than on\nan account of individual responsibility for particular criminal offences. The Complainants submit that they\nhave been in detention since then.\n4. The Complainants also claim that a year after their detention a new legislation was enacted whereby the\nSpecial Public Prosecutor's (SPO) was established and mandated to conduct \"investigation and bring to\ntrial Dergue officials] detainees, as well as those persons who are responsible for having committed\noffences and are at large, both within and [outside] the country\".\n5. They submit that upon coming into force, the SPO Proclamation barred and suspended the applicability\nof provisions concerning time limitation of criminal action to proceedings instituted by the SPO office;\nthereby giving the SPO the liberty to submit charges, evidence1 and other matters pertaining thereto\nwhenever it pleased, without any concerns about the statute of limitation miming against its actions, and\nforeclosing their right to fair trial. Such offences may not be commuted by amnesty or pardon.\"\n6. They aver that the SPO Proclamation also ousted the applicability of the provisions of habeas corpus\nunder the Civil Procedure Code to persons detained prior to the coming into force of the Proclamation in\nmatters under the jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor, thereby wiping out the possibility of challenging the\nexcessively prolonged detention without trial of the detainees. According to the Complainants this ouster is\ndiscriminatory as it applies to the targeted groups only, and was applied retroactively, as it narrowed down\nthe rights of the detainees to judicially challenge their prolonged detention.\n7. The complainants further submit that although the law demands a speedy trial, the victims stayed in\ndetention without access to legal counsel from 1991 - 1994, and that the SPO trial finally commenced only\nin October 1994. The Dergue officials discovered during the trial they have been charged with the crime of\nGenocide and Crime Against Humanity under Article 281 of the Ethiopia Penal Code of 1957. The\nallegations included the killing and torture of secessionists, political activists and farm owners.\n8. The Complainants submit that after fifteen (15) years of detention of the alleged victims and twelve (l2)\nyears of the commencement of the trial, the proceeding yet to be concluded.\n9. They aver further that the Dergue officials were collectively charged solely on basis of being members of\nthe Council of the defunct Provisional Military Administration, and accordingly, they have been defending\ntheir cases collectively; which procedure has made it difficult to individualise guilt, or to prove/rebut\nindividual innocence and guilt, and according to the Complainants will lead to collective guilt and collective\npunishment.\n10. This situation is alleged to have also manifestly contributed to the delay of the proceedings. In order to\nexpedite the trial therefore, it is submitted that the Dergue officials have pleaded with the Court for\nindividual trials, and that their request was overruled. It is also noted that an appeal on this issue, being an\n\"interlocutory matter\" is permissible only if or when the party lodges an appeal on the conviction or\nsentencing of the final verdict, and that since the final judgment is yet to be handed down, the detainees do\nnot have a right of appeal on this issue at this stage of the proceedings.\n11. The Complainants claim that although all the Dergue officials were collectively charged with the crime\nof Genocide, they raised an objection through their defence lawyers that the charge filed by the Prosecution\n1\n\n\fdid not clearly stipulate which cases fall under Genocide and which ones fall under crime against humanity,\nhowever, the court proceeded without making a ruling on the issue. They submit that to their dismay, they\nlater learnt that most of those indicted had all been convicted and sentenced to rigorous prison terms,\nincluding capital punishment for the crime of Genocide. Those sentenced to death are waiting for the\ndecision of the Head of State whether they would be pardoned or executed.\n12. They allege that Genocide has an international definition, and by adding illegal and clandestine political\nparties and organizations to the list of protected entities under the Genocide Convention, the Ethiopian\ncourts have created a new crime of genocide by analogy. The Complainants submit that the Ethiopian court\nby creating crimes by analogy have not only deviated from the international Genocide Convention to which\ns Ethiopia is a party, but also Article 9 of the Constitution of Ethiopia, which stipulates that all the laws of\nthe land must be interpreted in conformity with international conventions, treaties and agreements.\n13. They averred that when trial commenced, they had requested for an impartial and international tribunal\nto be set up to investigate the allegations but the Respondent State refused. The judges were mostly fresh\nUniversity graduates, civil servants and ex-combatants from the new regime. Regarding the right to be\nrepresented by legal counsel, Complainants submit that the Court ordered legal practitioners to represent\nthem in the subsequent trials, and that they did not have the chance to make a choice counsel, but had to\ncontend with the legal counsels assigned them by the State.\n14. It is also alleged that the lawyers assigned to the detainees did not have the right to decline the order of\nthe State to take up the cases, even if they indicated that they were not interested and/or that they did not\nhave the expertise in defending cases dealing with the crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity.\nThe lawyers were allegedly underpaid for the work, with no incentives and many of them are said to have\ngiven up going to Court to defend the detainees, consequently leaving many of the detainees virtually\nwithout legal counsel.\n15. They submit that the detainees fall under the following categories:\no Those that have been sentenced from, rigorous imprisonment up to death;\no Those that have presented their defence and are awaiting judgment at the Federal High Court;\no Those that are in the process of presenting their defence and\no Those that have appealed to the Supreme Court after having been sentenced by the Federal High Court.\n16. The Complainants submit that the detainees have been frustrated by the long adjournments, shortages\nand frequent change of judges and absenteeism. This has been exacerbated by the movement of judges\non circuit basis to different regions of the capital.\n17. The Complainants informed the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the African\nCommission or the Commission), that out of the 109 Dergue officials, only 76 survived to be charged\nincluding those in the Diaspora; only 46 appeared in court; while 9 have died during the proceedings in\nprison; and that to date, 37 have remained to defend their case collectively. However, the African\nCommission was later informed by the IHRDA that not less than ten (10) of the detainees have died in\ndetention before they were able to know their conviction or acquittal and that some of the deaths occurred\nafter the submission of the present Communication; with the last one in March/April 2006.\n18. The Complainants claim that the Government is using this case as a means of precluding certain\ngroups or a sector of a population from participating in political activities. They submit that while the\nGovernment is using the judiciary to create an image and sense of justice to the international community\nand advocate of human rights, the truth is that the charge convictions and sentences are all politically\nmotivated, the end result of which is a \"Victor's Justice\".\n19. The Complainants submitted that the delay and procedural irregularities in the case have been\nunprecedented in judicial history and reminded the African Commission that \"Justice threatened anywhere\nis justice threatened everywhere\".\n\nArticles alleged to have been violated\n20. The Complainants allege violation of Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 (1) (a), (b), (c), (d), 7(2), 25 and 26 of the\nAfrican Charter by the Respondent State.\n\n2\n\n\fPrayers\n21. The Complainants request the African Commission to:\no Declare specifically that the Proclamation setting up the Special Prosecutor Office and the conduct of\nofficials of the Federal Government of Ethiopia during the trial of the Dergue Officials constitute a violation\nof the right to be presumed innocent guaranteed in Article 7 (1) (b) of the Charter;\no Declare specifically that by failing to try the victims within a reasonable time after their detention and\nsubjecting them to a trial that lasted for more than 12 years, Ethiopia has violated their right to a speedy\ntrial guaranteed in Article 7 (1) (d) of the Charter;\no Declare that by failing to recognize the victims' right to a fair trial as enshrined in the African Charter, the\nFederal Government of Ethiopia has violated Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter;\no Award compensation to those who remained in detention pending the completion of their trial and were\neventually found innocent, and recommend that the period of detention be counted into the time of\nimprisonment of the victims;\no Strongly recommend the Ethiopian Courts not to pass death sentences against any of victims of the trials\nconsidering the fact that several rights of the victims have been violated in the process of the trial;\no Strongly recommend that the Ethiopian Courts, which may be approached by way of appeal, to commute\nthe capital sentences passed against the victims to terms of imprisonment. In the alternative or as\ncomplementary, should recommend to the authorities (the Head of State and the Prime Minister) in\naccordance to the power conferred upon them by Ethiopian laws to reduce capital punishment\nimprisonment terms;\no Strongly recommend the Federal Government of Ethiopia that legislative and other measures should be\ntaken to ensure that all citizens of Ethiopia enjoy the right to a fair trial guaranteed in the African Chaffer.\n\nProcedure\n22. The Complaint was received at the Secretariat on 16 November 2004.\n23. On 14 January 2005, the Secretariat wrote to the Complainants through the office of the Commissioner\nfor Political Affairs asking them whether the complaint should be considered as a Communication before\nthe Commission.\n24. On 14 April 2005, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainants confirming that the complaint\nshould be treated as a Communication.\n25. At its 37th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the African Commission considered the\nCommunication and decided to be seized thereof.\n26. By Note Verbale of 24 May 2005, the Respondent State was notified of the African Commission's\ndecision and requested to submit its arguments on admissibility within three months of the notification. By\nletter of the same date, the Complainants were notified of the African Commission's decision.\n27. On 23 August 2005, the Secretariat received the arguments of the Respondent State on the\nadmissibility communication.\n28. On 25 August 2005, Secretariat received the Complainant's arguments on admissibility\n29. By Note Verbale of 25 August 2005, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Respondent State's\nsubmission and transmitted the Complainant's submission to the State. By letter of the same date, the\nSecretariat informed the Complainant of the Respondent State's submissions.\n30. On 23 September 2005, the Secretariat received additional submission on admissibility from the\nRespondent State.\n31. At its 38th Ordinary Session Banjul, The Gambia, the African Commission deferred consideration of the\nCommunication to allow the Complainant submit further arguments on admissibility.\n32. By Note Verbale dated 15 December 2005 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat of the African\nCommission notified both parties of the African Commission's decision and the Complainant was requested\n3\n\n\fto submit arguments within thirty days.\n33. On 6 March 2006, the Secretariat sent by DHL, all the submissions of the State on the admissibility of\nthe Communication to the Complainant and requested the latter to send submissions within 30 days.\n34. On 29 March 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a letter from the IHRDA\nindicating its intention to assist the Complainant in dealing with the case and its intention to become a\nco-author to the Communication.\n35. On 29 March 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission acknowledged receipt of the IHRDA's\nletter.\n36. At its 39th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 11 - 25 May 2006, the African\nCommission deferred further consideration on the admissibility of the Communication in order to make a\npreliminary determination of the status of the co-author.\n37. By a Note Verbale dated 29 May 2006 and by a letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the\nAfrican Commission's decision, and the IHRDA was requested to explain how it intends to become a coauthor to the Communication.\n38. On 7 August 2006, the Secretariat received a brief from the IHRDA explaining its status as co-author of\nthe communication.\n39. By letter dated 15 August 2006, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt IHRDA's letter and submission,\nand by a Note Verbale of the same date, transmitted both documents to the Respondent State.\n40. By Note Verbale dated, 10 October 2006, the Secretariat reminded the Respondent State to submit its\ncomments on the submission made the IHRDA before 31 October 2006.\n41. At its 40th Ordinary Session held from 15 to 29 November 2006, the African Commission considered the\nCommunication in light of the IHRDA, and decided to defer further consideration of its 41st Ordinary\nSession in order to allow the Respondent State reply to the IHRDA's submissions on admissibility, in line\nwith Rule 117(2) Commission's Rules of Procedure.\n42. By letter and a Note Verbale dated 9 and 15 February 2007, the parties were respectively informed\nabout the African Commission's decision. The African Commission further reminded the Respondent State\nto submit its comments of the submissions made by the IHRDA before 15th March 2007.\n43. By Note Verbale dated 24 April 2007, the African Commission reminded the Respondent State to\nrespond to the IHRDA's submissions on admissibility; and requested the State to make the said\nsubmissions by 10 May 2007.\n44. At its 41st Ordinary Session held from 16 to 30 May 2007, in Accra Ghana, the African Commission, in\nthe absence of any response from the Respondent State, acted on the evidence before it in line with Rule\n117 (4). It therefore made a preliminary determination on the IHRDA's status as a co-author to the\nCommunication arid declared the Communication admissible.\n45. By Note Verbale of 25 June 2007 and by letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the\nAfrican Commission's decision, and requested to make submissions on the merits.\n46. By letter dated 31 July 2007, the Complainant requested the African Commission to postpone\nconsideration on the merits of the Communication to its 43rd Ordinary Session to give it adequate time to\nprepare its arguments.\n47. By Note Verbale or 24 September 2007, the Respondent State submitted its arguments on the merits.\n48. At its 42nd Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the Communication and deferred its\ndecision the 43rd Ordinary Session to allow the complainant to make its submissions on the merits.\n49. By Note Verbale of 19 December 2007 and by letter of the same date, both parties to the\ncommunication were notified of the African Commission's decision.\n50. On 18th April 2008, the Secretariat received the Complainant's submissions on the merits of\ncommunication.\n51. By Note Verbale of 24 April 2008, the Secretariat forwarded the Complainant's submissions to the\nRespondent State.\nSUBMISSIONS ON LOCUS STANDI AND JOINDER OF PARTIES\nSubmissions from the IHRDA\n\n52. The IHRDA submits that it is a pan-African organisation with an interest in the protection and promotion\nof human rights in Africa, and with a specialization in litigation before the African Commission.\n53. The IHRDA informs the African Commission that it has information about blatant violations of\n4\n\n\fCharter-guaranteed human rights in the Respondent State, being the detention of over 106 former Dergue\nofficials, and that it had been interested in bringing these to the attention of the Commission. However,\nhaving discovered that there is a pending Communication before the Commission - i.e., based on the same\nfacts and alleged violations, it decided to apply to the African Commission to be joined as a co-author of\nthis Communication, rather than bring a fresh Communication. The IHRDA notes that the original author of\nthe Communication has abandoned it and will not appear before the Commission anymore due to clear and\npresent threat against her life, and as a consequence has refused to speak with the Institute or anyone.\n54. The interest of the IHRDA in this matter, especially now that original author has abandoned the matter\nis stated to be related to its principal objective, which is providing necessary assistance and expertise...\"\nand supported by the principle of action popularis.\nResponse from the Respondent State\n\n55. The Respondent State argues in their oral submissions that the IHRDA is not registered in Ethiopia and\nhas no relationship with the victims, and therefore does not have a \"legal interest\" in the Communication.\nThe IHRDA's Response to the Submission of the Respondent State\n\n56. The IHRDA argues that there is no requirement of \"citizenship\" or \"legal interest\" in the provisions of\nArticle 56(1) of the Charter which refers to the authorship of Communications (under the admissibility\nrequirements) before the Commission. More so, it argues, neither the Charter's provisions nor the practice\nof the Commission imposes any limitation on the locus standi of authors of Communications.\n57. According to the IHRDA, Article 56 of the Charter provides for seven admissibility requirements, and\nthat the list therein is exhaustive, adding that \"Legal Interest\" and \"Citizenship\" requirements as argued by\nthe Respondent State do not feature under the admissibility requirements under Article 56, and are\ntherefore at odds with the Charter. It further argues that introducing these additional requirements to the\nadmissibility requirements under the Charter would be tantamount to reviewing the Charter, which the\nRespondent State lacks the power to do. It notes that respect for the existing text is the practice of\ninternational mechanisms in general and of the African Commission, in particular. The IHRDA notes further\nthat introducing additional requirements to the admissibility requirements under the Charter would render\nthe Commission inaccessible, thereby defeating the intention of the drafters of the Charter, which\nencourages, rather than stifles, the submission of human rights violations to the Commission.\n58. Thus, the IHRDA contends that it is not required to prove legal interest, but that it suffices to show that it\nis interested in the protection and promotion of human rights through the African regional mechanism.\nSimilarly, it notes that the \"citizenship\" of the IHRDA, which is not registered in Ethiopia, is irrelevant to the\nadmissibility of the Communication; and argues that such a restrictive approach would complicate matters\nwhere, for one reason or another, the \"domestic actors\" are unable to lodge complaint themselves before\nthe Commission. It argues that such an approach would insulate the violating states against international\nscrutiny and foster the culture impunity, which is at odds with the purpose of the Charter to promote and\nprotect the rights and freedoms of Africans.\n59. It further contends that its line of argument is in consonance with the practice of other regional and UN\nmechanisms, whereby complaints may be lodged on behalf of alleged victims of human rights violations.\n60. The IHRDA further contends that with respect to Article 56(1) of the Charter, the provision merely\nrequires that a Communication should \"indicate their authors\", and that is designed to enable the\nCommission's Secretary to remain in contact with the author, to keep him or her informed about the status\nof the Communication, and to request further information if it is required. The IHRDA disagrees with the\nRespondent State's argument that there is no author to the present Communication, and submits that this\nis a misconception of the \"victim - author\" difference.\nThe African Commission Decision on Locus standi and Joinder of Parties\nLocus standi\n\n61. The African Commission notes that neither the African Charter nor the Rules of Procedure the\nCommission makes provisions on the locus standi of parties before it. The Commission has however,\nthrough its practice and jurisprudence adopted the actio popularis principle allowing everyone the legal\ninterest and capacity to file a Communication, for its consideration. For this purpose, non-victim individuals,\n5\n\n\fgroups and NGOs constantly submit Communications to the Commission. Thus, the Commission upholds\nthe argument of the IHRDA on their capacity to approach the Commission in its capacity as an organisation\nwith an interest in the protection and promotion of human rights in Africa under the actio popularis principle.\n62. With respect to the argument of the Respondent State that there is no legal interest for the Institute to\ndeal with the case, the Commission has made it clear, inter alia, in WOAT/OMCTs vs. Zaire 2 that the\nauthor of a Communication need not be the victim nor related to the victim(s) of the human rights violations\nalleged. This position is put succinctly in the Commission's decision in Malawi African Association and\nOthers v Mauritania3 , where it held that \"Article 56(1) of the Charter demands that any persons submitting\ncommunications to the Commission relating to human and peoples' rights must reveal their identity. They\ndo not necessarily have to be the victims of such violations or members of their families. This characteristic\nof the African Charter reflects sensitivity to the practical difficulties that individuals can face in countries\nwhere human rights are violated. The national or international channels of remedy may not be accessible to\nthe victims.\"4\n63. As a result of the foregoing, the commission is disagrees with the Respondent State's argument that\nthe Institute lacks legal interest in the matter.\n64. With respect to the argument the Respondent State that the Institute is not a citizen of or an\norganization registered in Ethiopia, the Commission made it clear in Spilg and Mack & DITSHWANELO (on\nbehalf of Lehlohonolo Bernard Kobedi) / Botswana5 that the person or NGO filing the Communication need\nnot be national or be registered in the territory of the Respondent State. There is no requirement of\n\"citizenship\" for the authorship of a Communication.6 Any interested individual or organisation can bring a\nCommunication on behalf of a victim and such individual or organisation need not be a citizen or be\nregistered within a States party to the African Charter.\n65. Thus, the fact that the Institute is not registered in Ethiopia is immaterial. As long as it satisfies the\nconditions set out in Article 56 of the African Charter, the African Commission will entertain the\nCommunication as it has done, in several other cases where Communications have been instituted by\nnon-nationals of the State against which the Communication is instituted.\n66. Accordingly, the African Commission holds that the Institute can appear before it in respect of the\npresent Communication under its much espoused actio popularis principle.\nJoinder of Parties\n\n67. Joinder of parties is a legal term which refers to the act if uniting as parties to an action all persons who\nhave the same rights or against whom rights are claimed, as either co-plaintiff co-defendants.7 Joinder of\nparties therefore allows multiple plaintiffs or defendants to join in an action if each of their claims arises\nfrom the same transaction or occurrence, or are of a similar nature or if there is a common question of law\nor fact relating all their claims.\n68. Notably, neither the African Charter nor the Rules of Procedure of the Commission make provision on\nthe joinder of parties before the Commission. The closest to this is Rule 114 (2) which provides that the\nCommission, may, if it deems it good, jointly consider two or more Communications. Consequently, the\nprerogative of the Commission, from the facts presented, to join Communications, and the same would\napply to the joinder of parties.\n69. The IHRDA has applied to join the present Communication as co- authors, and indeed, as shown\nabove, there is no jurisprudential or legal bar that precludes them from joining as co-authors. Indeed, if the\nAfrican Commission were deny the Complainant access to its Communications procedure, there is the\npossibility of the alleged victims, on whose behalf this Communication has been brought to continue to\nviolations of their fundamental rights; especially as the first Complainant has refused to proceed with the\nCommunication, even though he has not formally communicated this decision to the Commission. Such\ndenial of access to the Institute would indeed be contrary to the spirit of the Charter which mandates the\nAfrican Commission to ensure the protection of human and peoples' rights in Africa.\n70. More specifically, in respect of the Respondent State's argument that there is no author to the present\nCommunication, the Commission notes that even if the original Complainant has formally withdrawn from\nthe present Communication, as the ultimate protector of human rights on the African continent, the\nCommission may still proceed to examine the Communication if it deems it appropriate. The Commission\nhereby alludes to the practice of other similar bodies such as the Inter-American Commission on Human\nRights.8 In this respect, the Commission notes that while there is no provision to this effect in its current\nrules of procedure, there is also nothing therein precluding it from adopting this progressive approach to the\n6\n\n\fprotection of human rights.\n71. Accordingly, the African Commission hereby joins the IHRDA as co- author to the present\nCommunication, in line with its widely espoused actio popularis principle, as an organisation with an\ninterest in the protection and promotion of human rights in Africa under the actio popularis principle. The\nCommunication will henceforth be cited as Haregewoin Gebresellaise and Institute for Human Rights &\nDevelopment in Africa / Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.\nThe Law on Admissibility\nRespondent State's Submissions on Admissibility\n\n72. The Respondent State's submissions on admissibility are divided into two parts. In Part One, the\nRespondent States provides a background of the conflict in Ethiopia that led to the overthrow of the Dergue\nRegime in 1991. The State notes the alleged gross human rights violations that were perpetrated by the\nand notes further that domestic mechanisms were put in place to prosecute perpetrators of gross human\nrights that were perpetrated by the said regime and notes further that domestic mechanisms human rights\nviolations. These mechanisms, according to the Respondent State includes the Special Prosecutors Office\nset up in 1992 to among other things, establish a historical record in human rights were put in place to\nprosecute perpetrators of gross according to the Respondent State/includes the Special Prosecutor Office\nset up in 1992 to, among other things, establish a historical record of human rights violations under the\nMengistu regime; and to bring officials, members and auxiliaries of the armed and security forces of the\nDergue regime who participated in the commission of serious human rights violations to justice.\n73. The Respondent State also notes that it has an independent judiciary dealing with the cases of the\nofficials and insists that most of the cases have been disposed of and some people have been tried, some\nset free, others have been convicted while some are still being tried.\n74. In Part Two of its submission, the Respondent State addresses itself to the question of Admissibility\nand argues that the Communication should be declared Inadmissible for the following reasons: that the\nComplainant failed to comply with the burden and standard of proof; that the case is pending before the\ncourts of the Respondent State, that remedies are available, effective and sufficient to address the matters\nraised in the Communication. The Respondent State also insists that the Special Prosecutor Office has\nsufficient and independent mechanism to address the grievances and that the remedies sought are beyond\nthe mandate of the African Commission. The State submits further that the Communication does not make\nreference to the African Charter and fails to indicate the provisions of the Charter alleged to have been\nviolated, adding that the case has already been settled by another international organ.\n75. According to the State, the Complainant is required to provide a prima facie evidence of an attempt to\nexhaust local remedies which the Complainant's have not exhausted. The State pointed out that the\nComplainants could have addressed their grievances to the High Court or the Judicial Administration\nOfficer or the Human Rights Commission.\n76. The State further avers that right to a speedy trial alleged to have been violated is embodied in\nEthiopian law, including in the Constitution, and is a fundamental right recognized by international human\nrights treaties Ethiopia has ratified, which by virtue of Article 9(4) is an integral part of the laws of Ethiopia.\nThus, according to the State, the courts are bound to ensure the realization of this right.\n77. The State acknowledges that in terms of Article 19 of its Constitution \"...where the interest of justice so\nrequires, the court may order the arrested person remain in custody, or when requested, remand him for a\ntime strictly required to carry out the investigation. In determining the additional time necessary for\ninvestigation, the court shall ensure that the responsible law enforcement authorities carry out the\ninvestigations respecting the arrested person's right to a speedy trial\".\n78. According to the State, these are legal safeguards that cancel the risk of breach of the right of me\naccused to speedy trial. The State points out that if the Prosecution's office or any other organ was\ntherefore 'engaged in an act that violates the victims' right to a speedy trial, they could and should have\ncalled the attention of the court to the violation. According to the State, there was no indication that the\nComplainants resorted to this.\n79. Regarding the Judicial Administration Council established by Proclamation No. 24/1996, the State\nindicates that one of its powers is to discipline judges who act in breach of disciplinary rules and if the judge\nturned a deaf ear to the pleas of the Complainants, they could and should have brought their complaints\nbefore the Judicial Administration Council, a recourse which the State claims was not sought by the\n7\n\n\fComplainants.\n80. The State argues further that the Complainants did not bring their grievances to the attention of the\nJudicial Administration Offices and the Human Rights Commission. According to the State, the\nComplainants have not shown that the judicial process was unduly prolonged and do not show why they\ndid not attempt to exhaust all these remedies available to them.\n81. The State also notes that for local remedies to be exhausted, the Complaint must have been dealt with\nby the highest court of the land, but in the instant case, there is no evidence to show that the Complainants\nhave submitted a case with the Federal Supreme Court of Ethiopia. The State however: notes that many of\nthe suspects have just recently brought their cases to the Supreme Court after being convicted by lower\ncourts and these cases are still awaiting judgment. The State notes further that with respect to senior\ngovernment officials of the Dergue regime, their cases were still being heard in the Federal High Court\nCriminal Branch and they still have an opportunity to appeal to higher courts, if convicted.\n82. Regarding the allegation of the Complainants that the process is unduly long, the State notes that\nmeasures have been taken to reduce the time that will be taken Jo effectively try the victims to meet\ninternational fair trial standards. It states that it is intended that all the trials will be completed by the\nbeginning of 2006. The state notes further that the delay has been caused by both the defence and the\nprosecution due to the many witnesses they had.\n83. The State claims the remedy sought by the Complainants is beyond the competence of the\nCommission, claiming that the latter is being requested to not only review the ongoing trial process in\nEthiopia but also to instruct Ethiopia on what form of domestic mechanism it should adopt in prosecuting\nand trying of persons accused of gross human rights violations. In particular, the State argues that the\ncomplainants are asking the Commission to order Ethiopia to agree to the setting up of an international\ntribunal similar to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda or the International Criminal Tribunal for\nthe Former Yugoslavia. The State notes that different countries have adopted different approaches in\nbringing human rights perpetrators to book, such as the establishment of the truth and reconciliation\ncommission, international tribunals, etc., but in Ethiopia, the government has established the Special\nProsecutions Offices, making a clear choice to prosecute former Dergue officials who committed serious\noffences and this decision has been widely supported by the international community.\n84. The State avers that the Complainants claim the right to pardon and amnesty under international law\nhas been infringed. According to the State, there are no such rights under international law, adding that, the\nEthiopian constitution precludes any blanket amnesty.\n85. According to the State, the Complainants' requests are not directly related to any human right\nguaranteed in the African Charter and thus the Communication is not compatible with the provisions of the\nCharter.\n86. The State went on to state that the Communication does not refer to the Charter and fails to indicate the\nprovision of the Charter that have been violated, noting that the African Commission has indicated that\nCommunications must illustrate a prima facie violation of the Charter by invoking specific provisions of the\nCharter alleged to have been violated. It also notes that the African Commission has rejected\nCommunications which failed to make reference to the provisions of the Charter, that even though they\ncited provisions under UN texts, made only general allegations to human rights violations without making\nany specific breaches of the Charter.\n87. The State also argues that the Communication has been settled by another international organ. The\nState indicates that in its report E / CN.4/1994/ 27, Decision Nos. 45/1992 and 33/1993, the UN Working\nGroup on Arbitrary Detention issued decisions regarding the detention and prosecution process involving\nthe victims. The State argues that following, this decision, the government took the necessary measures in\norder to comply. The State argues that the Communication should therefore be declared inadmissible as it\nhas been settled by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.\n88. The state also argues that the Communication does not conform with the procedures in the African\nCharter and the Commission's rules of procedures. The State notes that the present Communication does\nnot meet the requirements of Communication, as it is simply a letter of appeal sent to the Special\nRapporteur on Prisons and Conditions of Detention in Africa. The State argues that the Special Rapporteur\nwas engaging the Commission on issues which \"it is already addressing and is adequately seized of\nthrough its promotional mandate\". The State concludes that the present Communication was not addressed\nto the Secretariat as a Communication but rather as a feedback from alleged victims of human rights to the\nSpecial Rapporteur during her visit to Ethiopia. The Respondent State therefore requests the Commission\nto also reject the Communication on this ground.\n8\n\n\fComplainants' submissions on Admissibility\n\n89. The Complainants note that Article 56 of the Charter provides for seven admissibility requirements, and\nthat the list therein is exhaustive. They submit that the present Communication fulfils all the requirements\nstipulated in Article 56 of the Charter and should therefore be declared admissible by the African\nCommission.\n90. With respect to Article 56(1) the Complainant submit that the authors of the Communication are clearly\nidentified Heregewoin Gabre-Sellasie and the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa (on\nbehalf of the over 106 Officials Dergue Regime). They thereby deny the Respondent State's argument that\nthe Communication has no author.\n91. In respect of Article 56(2) which requires that Communication must be compatible with the African\nCharter or the OAU Charter, the Complainants note that neither the Charter nor the Commission's\nGuidelines on the Submission of Communications requires the Complainants to cite the precise violations\nof the Charter alleged, and that in fact, the Guidelines clearly provides that \"...the Complainant need not\nmention the specific articles of the Charter alleged to have been violated\". They also reject the argument of\nthe Respondent State in this regard.\n92. The Complainants argue that their subsequent submission on admissibility actually specified the\narticles of the Charter allegedly violated by the Respondent State.\n93. In respect of Article 56(3) which requires that Communications should not be written in insulting or\ndisparaging language directed at the State, its institutions or the African Union; the Complainants submit\nthat the present Communication is based entirely on the factual situation giving rise to the complaint, and is\nwritten in a manner that is both polite and respectful.\n94. In respect of Article 56(4) which provides that the Communication must not be based exclusively on\nnews disseminated through the mass media, the Complainants submit that the present Communication is\nbased on information verified by first-hand accounts of the events, supported by means of affidavits.9\n95. In respect of Article 56(5) which requires that Complainants exhaust all local remedies before\napproaching the Commission, the Complainants submit that the State has been given sufficient notice of\nthe continuing violations and has had ample opportunity to remedy the situation. They argue that \"the laws,\nprocedures and practices have conspired to make it impossible for the Dergue Officials to seek any viable\nlocal remedies and/or made the remedies ineffective at best\".\n96. The Complainants rebut the argument of the Respondent State on their access to the High Court or the\nJudicial Administrative Commission (JAC) or the Human Rights Commission. In respect of the High Court,\nthey note that the SPO Proclamation forecloses the detainees' rights to habeas corpus or a speedy trial,\nand that their request for individual charges cannot be appealed against until the final verdict is given.10\n97. In respect of the accessing the Human Rights Commission, they argue that apart from the fact that the\nHuman Rights Commission was established nine years after effective detention of the victims; the former is\nexpressly precluded by its establishing law from interfering in cases before the courts at any level. Article 7\nof the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission Establishing Proclamation No. 210/2000 provides that \"The\n[Human Rights] Commission shall have full powers to receive and investigate all complaints on human\nrights violations made against any person, save cases brought before...the courts of law, at any level\".\n98. In respect of the JAC, the Complainants submit that the body has always been fully aware of the trials\nof the Dergue Officials, and has chosen to remain a \"disinterested spectator\".\n99. They concluded that there is no remedy left for the Dergue Officials to exhaust as they have exhausted\nall available local remedies. Alternatively, they submit that should there be any reason to believe\notherwise,11 exhausting them as these remedies would be ineffective and/or their exhaustion would be\n'undesirable'. This, according to the Complainants, is because the process of exhaustion of local remedies\nhas been unduly prolonged, and the reasons for the delays are all attributable to the Respondent State.12\nThey therefore urge the Commission to follow its jurisprudence in Institute for Human and Development in\nAfrica (on behalf of Collectif des Veuves et Ayants droits)/Mauritania13 where it held that the duty on the\nComplainant to pursue legal avenues at the national level may be waived if it is 'impractical'14 or\n'undesirable' for the Complainant to do so15 .\n100. In respect of Article 56(7) which requires that Communications must not deal with cases which have\nbeen settled in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (UN), the Charter of the OAU (now AU)\nor the provisions of African Charter; the Complainants note the argument of the Respondent that the\npresent Communication has been settled by another international organ, namely the UN Working Group on\n9\n\n\fArbitrary Detention (UNWGAD), by its Decisions Nos. 45/1992 and 33/1993.16 The Complainants however\nargue that there is no overlap between the complaint submitted to the UNWGAD and the present\nCommunication. They argue that the substance of the present Communication varies with the one dealt\nwith by the UNWGAD, as do the victims, the facts making up the present Communication and the period\nover which the alleged violations have been committed.\n101. They note specifically that the complaint to the UNWGAD was submitted and decided before the\ncommencement of the trial of the Dergue Officials, therefore did not cover the subsequent period of trial\nwhich the present Communication is dealing with. They also note that the complaint UNWGAD was\nconcerned solely with five members of the Dergue, and therefore does not cover the over 106 Dergue\nOfficial in respect of whom the present Communication has been submitted before the Commission. Hence,\nthey submit that the present Communication does not deal with any settled matter. They further argue that\nfor the matter to have been settled there should have been a decision on merits complained of herein,\nwhich is not the case. In support of this argument, they cite the Commission's decision in Bob Njoku vs.\nEgypt,17 where the Commission \"had rightfully rejected the argument of the Respondent States on similar\ngrounds and declared the Communication Admissible\".18\n102. The Complainants conclude that the seven admissibility requirements have been effectively complied\nwith in the present Communication and respectfully requested the African Commission to declare the\nCommunication admissible.\nThe African Commission's analysis on Admissibility\n103. The admissibility of Communications submitted before the African Commission pursuant to Article 55\nof the African Charter is governed by the seven conditions set out in Article 56 of the African Charter. The\nComplainants submit that they have complied with all the Communication does not meet certain\nrequirements under Article 56, in particular, Article 56 (2), (5) and (7).\n104. The African Commission notes, that only three of the requirements seem to be in dispute between the\nparties, but will proceed to examine all seven requirements to ensure they meet the admissibility test.\n105. Article 56(1) of the Africa Charter states that \"Communication relating to Human Rights... received by\nthe Commission shall be considered if they indicate their author even if the latter request anonymity...\".The\nCommunication indicates the authors as well as the victims of the alleged violations, and the African\nCommission therefore holds that the requirement under Article 56(1) of the African Charter is fulfilled.\n106. Article 56(2) of the African Charter states that \"Communication...received by the Commission shall be\nconsidered if they are compatible with the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present\nCharter.\" The facts reveal that the Communication is brought against the Republic of Ethiopia which\nbecame a party to the African Charter 1998, secondly the Communication alleges violations of rights\ncontained in the African Charter. The State argues that the Communication is incompatible with the Charter\nas it does not indicate any provision of the Article alleged to have been violated. The Commission notes\nthat the Complainants submissions on admissibility details the rights allegedly violated and specifically cited\nthe corresponding Articles of the Charter. The Commission concurs with the Complainants that the\nComplainants does not necessarily need to list the articles of the Charter alleged to have been violated.\nThe African Commission is satisfied that the requirement of Article 56(2) has been fulfilled.\n107. Articled 56(3) of the African Charter states that \"Communications ...received by the Commission shall\nbe considered if they are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State\nconcerned and its institutions or to the Organisation of African Unity now African Union (AU)\". The present\nCommunication is not written in disparaging or insulting language directed to the State, its institutions or the\nAU and for these reasons the African Commission holds that the requirements of Article 56 (3) been\ncomplied with.\n108. Article 56(4) of the African Charter states that \"Communications relating to human and Peoples'\nRights...shall be considered if they are not based exclusively on news disseminate through the mass\nmedia. The Communication is not based on news disseminated through the mass media and there is\nevidence to show that the Communication is based on statements and affidavits from the victims. For these\nreasons, the African Commission holds that the requirements under Article 56(4) have been fulfilled.\n109. Article 56(5) of the African Charter states that \"Communications relating to human and Peoples'\nRights... shall be considered if they: are sent after exhausting remedies, if any unless it is obvious that this\nprocedure is unduly prolonged\". The Respondent State submits that the Complainants failed to avail\nthemselves of the local remedies within the State. The State contends that the Complainants could have\n10\n\n\fapproached the High Court, Human Rights Commission as well as the Judicial Administration Council. The\nComplainants argue that the state has had ample notice of the alleged violations and ought to have taken\nsteps to deal with the same. They add with respect to the Human Rights Commission that the latter was\nestablished nine years after the arrest and detention of the victims and that the Commission does not have\nthe power to deal with matters already being handled by the courts.\n110. In the present Communication therefore, the fact that the Complainants have not sufficiently\ndemonstrated why they could not exhaust domestic remedies does not mean such remedies are available,\neffective and sufficient. The African Commission can infer from the circumstances surrounding the case\nand determine whether such remedies are in fact available, and if they are, whether they are effective and\nsufficient.\n111. The invocation of the exception to the rule requiring that remedies under domestic law should be\nexhausted provided for in Article 56(5) must invariably be linked to the determination of possible violations\nof certain rights enshrined in the African Charter, such as the right to a fair trial enshrined under Article 7 of\nthe African Charter.19 The exception to the rule on the exhaustion of domestic remedies would therefore\napply where the domestic situation of the State does not afford due process of law for the protection of the\nright or rights that have allegedly been violated.\n112. In the present Communication, this seems to be the case. The victims cannot access the courts to\nclaim protection of their rights, either because they have been displaced or because they are being\nharassed, intimidated and persecute, the prevalence of violence in the region makes any attempt at\nexhausting local remedies by the victims an affront to common sense, good conscience and justice.\n113. Another rationale for the exhaustion requirement is that a government should have notice of human\nrights violation in order to have the opportunity to remedy such violation, before being called to account by\nan international tribunal. The African Commission is of the view that the Respondent State has had ample\ntime and notice of the alleged violation to at least create conducive environment for the enjoyment of the\nrights of the victims. If it is shown that the State has had ample notice and time within which to remedy the\nsituation, as is the case with the present Communication, the State may be said to have been properly\ninformed and expected to have taken appropriate steps to remedy the violations alleged.\n114. On the claim that the Communication has been settled by UN mechanisms, the African Commission\nwishes to state that a matter is settled within the context of Article 56 (7) of the African Charter if it has been\ndealt with by any of the human rights treaty bodies or the Charter bodies of the United Nations system.\n115. The UN treaty bodies include bodies created under international human rights treaties. They presently\ninclude inter alia the Human Rights Committee (HRC), the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural\nRights (CESCR), the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CBRD), the Committee on the\nElimination of Discrimination Against Women (CBDAW), the Committee Against Torture (CAT), the\nCommittee on the Rights of the Child (CRC)and the Committee on Migrant Workers (CMW).\n116. The Charter bodies are those created under the UN Charter and include the Human Rights Council\n(HRC), Special procedures of the Human Rights Council, in particular, the 1503 procedure20 and the\nSub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.\n117. To be settled also requires that the treaty or Charter body dealing with the matter has taken a decision\nwhich addresses the concerns, including the relief being sought by the Complainant. It is not enough for the\nmatter to simply be discussed by these bodies. In the opinion of this Commission, the present\nCommunication was never submitted to any of these bodies, either by the present Complainant or any\nother individual or institution. The general human rights situation in the region was rather discussed by the\nUN Security Council following reports from different agencies of the UN itself. None of these bodies\nspecifically dealt with, or was intended to deal with the allegations raised in the present Communication and\nit can thus not be said that the matter has been dealt with or settled as required under Article 56 (7) of the\nAfrican Charter.\n118. The African Commission agrees with the Respondent State's argument that the Complainants'\nargument relating to Ethiopia's protection of political groups from genocide is irrelevant to the present issue\nof admissibility. In same vein, the Commission notes that the Respondent State's argument relating to the\nnature of the remedy sought by the complainants .is irrelevant to the present issue of admissibility, and\nprematurely raised at this stage. The Commission cannot therefore pronounce upon it at the present stage,\nand notes that the proceeding on the merits would thus place the Commission in a better position to make\na finding in this regard.\n119. Finally, in respect of the Respondent State's submission that the present Communication does not\nconform with the procedures in the African Charter, as it was done by way of a mere letter of appeal sent to\n11\n\n\fthe (then) Special Rapporteur on Prisons and Conditions of Detention in Africa. The African Commission\nnotes that while Article 47 of the African Charter and Rule 88 of its old Rules of Procedure, which relate\nonly to Inter-State Communications, prescribe that Communications should be submitted in written form,\nand addressed to the Secretary General of the OAU (now Chairperson of the AU Commission) and the\nChairperson of the African Commission; there is no provision either in the Charter or its Rules of Procedure\nrelating to the prescribed form for Non-State/Individual Communications.\n120. The Commission further notes that Article 56 of the Charter has an exhaustive list of admissibility\nrequirements, which do not include the form of the Communication or the manner in which it was received.\nThe Commission therefore holds that the prescribed (and not authorised) form for submission of\nCommunications is not a prerequisite for the admissibility of communications, and is extraneous to the\npresent issue before the Commission. More so, the present Communication was brought in written form,\nalbeit addressed to a Commissioner of the African Commission, and the then Special Rapporteur on\nPrisons and Conditions of Detention in Africa. A letter to a visiting Special Rapporteur Prisons and\nConditions of Detention in Africa seemed to have been the most practicable and reliable means for the\nComplainants to bring the plight of the victims to the African Commission.\n121. For these reasons, the African Commission declares this Communication Admissible.\n\nTHE MERITS\nCOMPLAINANTS' SUBMISSIONS ON THE MERITS\n\nClarifications Submitted by the Complainants\n122. Since the submission of their brief on Admissibility the Complainants have informed the African\nCommission that they are making some substantial amendments and clarifications to their initial\nsubmissions.\n123. It says that in paragraph two of the brief on Admissibility it had alleged violations of Articles 1, 2, 3, 5,\n6, 7(1 )(a), (b), (c), (d), 7(2), 25 and 26 of the African Charter and the right to privacy guaranteed under the\ninternational conventions to which the Respondent State is a party to. It states that in spite of its efforts and\nthe fact that the violations appear very probable, it has not been able to get evidence to support some of\nthe alleged violations. It has therefore decided to drop its previous Claim that Articles 3, 5, 6 and 7(2) are\nviolated for lack of evidence. It states that it will only argue violations of Articles 1, 2, 7 (1) (b)(d) of the\nAfrican Charter.\n124. The Complainants further state that Paragraph four of its brief on Admissibility stated that the victims\nwere detained on account of collective responsibility for policies or abuses by the Dergue regime rather\nthan on account of individual responsibility for particular criminal offences. In addition paragraph 13 stated\nthat the 106 detainees were collectively charged under one file, and have been defending their case\ncollectively and that the procedure of collective trial has made it difficult to individualize guilt, or to prove/\nrebut individual's innocence and guilt.\n125. The Complainants say that they wish to qualify the above statement to the effect that although there\nwas joinder, the charges, the conviction and the sentences are individualized. They argue that the trial of all\nthose who have been alleged to have committed crimes during the era of the former Government were not\nconducted in a single case or in a single venue.21 Rather, there have been several trials going on at\ndifferent locations throughout the country both at the Federal High Court divisions and Supreme Courts of\nthe regional states of the Ethiopian Federation.\n126. They also state that from the former Dergue Officials accused jointly, for example, one defendant was\nacquitted, while others were convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from 23 years to\nlife. They state that the Victims were able to present separate arguments of their own and so they are\naccordingly clarifying their previous submissions. It nevertheless argues that the joinder of the trials has\nimmensely contributed to the undue delay in the trial of the former Dergue Officials.\n127. The Complainants also informs the African Commission that paragraph nine of its brief on\nAdmissibility indicates that the proceedings are yet to come to a conclusion fifteen years after the detention\nof the Complainants and twelve years after the commencement of the proceedings. They state that the\nstatement was true over a year ago, however, some developments have taken place subsequently. They\nstate that on 12 December 2006, the Ethiopian Federal High Court convicted many of the victims, among\n12\n\n\fothers, on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. They also state that on 11 January 2007\nprison sentences ranging from 23 years to life imprisonment were passed, while some of the convicted\npersons were sentenced to death. They also inform the African Commission that the SPO has since filed\nan appeal to the Federal Supreme Court demanding capital punishment for many of the 55 sentenced to\nlife imprisonment. Some of the convicted persons have also appealed while others are expected to file\ncross appeals. Therefore the trials, at least for some of the 55 victims, are yet to be completed.\n128. The Complainants also stated that the major violations argued, hereunder, relate to prolonged pre-trial\ndetention and trials lasting for more than 12 years, thus resulting in violations of the Complainants' right to\nfair trial.22 Thus article 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights is the main legal basis on\nwhich it anchors its argument. They also state that in recognition of Article 60 of the African Charter by\nwhich the African Commission is empowered to draw inspiration from other international instruments for the\nprotection of human and peoples' rights, they are drawing the attention of the African Commission to Article\n14\n× 1.

In additional they draw the attention of the African Commission to, among others, the Guidelines on\nthe Role of Prosecutors, the Basic Principles of the Role Lawyers and the Statutes of the International\nCriminal Court and the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.\nAlleged Violation of Article 1 and 2 of the African Charter\n130. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State failure to recognize the rights of the former\nDergue officials enshrined in the African Charter violates Articles 1 and 2 of the African Charter. They argue\nthat States Parties to the Charter are obliged not only to recognize the rights, duties and freedoms\nenshrined in it but also undertake to adopt legislative and other measures to give effect to them. States are\nalso required to ensure that these rights are available to all without discrimination. The Complainants\nsubmit that where a State neglects to protect the rights in the Charter, this can constitute a violation of\nArticle 1, even if the State or its agents are not the immediate cause of the violation.\n131. The Complainants further submit that by failing to respect the Victims right to a fair and speedy trial\nguaranteed in Article 7 of the African Charter, the Respondent State is similarly in violation of Articles 1 and\n2 of the Charter as a violation.\nAlleged Violation of Article 7(1 )(b) - right to have ones cause heard\n\nArticle 7(l)(b) of the African Charter states:\n(b) the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\n132. The Complainants argue the Respondent State has violated the rights of the former Dergue officials to\nbe presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court or tribunal.The Complainants state that the\npresumption of innocence is universally recognized23 and proclaimed by all major legal systems of the\nworld.24 They stated that the Respondent State violated the right to be presumed innocent enshrined in\nArticle 7 (1)(b) of the Charter in following ways: a. Proclamation No. 22/1992 which provides for the\nestablishment of the special prosecutor's office violates the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in\nArticle 7 (1) (b) of the African Charter. Proclamation No. 22/1992 provides, inter alia, as follows:\nWHEREAS the people of Ethiopia have been deprived of their personal human and political rights and\nsubject to gross oppression under the yoke of the fascistic rules of the Dergue-WPE regime for the last\nseventeen years;\nWHEREAS heinous and horrendous criminals which occupy a special chapter in the history of the of the\npeople of Ethiopia have been perpetrated against the people of Ethiopia by official, members and\nauxiliaries of the security and armed forces of the Dergue-WPE regime;\nWHEREAS officials and auxiliaries of the Dergue-WPE dictatorial regime impoverished the economy of the\nCountry by plundering illegally confiscating and destroying the property of the people as well\nmisappropriating public and state property;\n\n15\n\n\fWHEREAS it is the interest of a just historical obligation to record for posterity the brutal offences the\nembezzlement of property perpetrated against the people of Ethiopia and to educate the people and make\nthem aware of those offences in order to prevent the recurrence of such a system of government.\n133. The Complainants argues that it is clear from this Proclamation that even before the Victims were\nbrought to court, they were branded criminals by the Proclamation. Thus, it argues, in the eyes of the\nTransitioned Government, the Victims had subjected Ethiopians to gross oppression under the yoke of a\nfascistic rule; they had perpetrated 'brutal', 'heinous' 'horrendous' crimes which occupy a special chapter in\nEthiopia's history, they had impoverished the Ethiopian economy through illegal plundering, destruction and\nmisappropriation of public property.\n134. It argues that the Proclamation looks more like a legislative sentence which only short of declaring the\nVictims guilty even before they were charged. It avers that legislation is conceived as a system of rules with\na generality of application for the regulation of the life and activities of the community as a whole and\nsingling out a person for individualized treatment by legislation may not only be arbitrary and discriminatory,\nit can lead itself to oppression, favoritism or other kinds of abuse.\n135. They further aver that in the performance of their duties, the Special Prosecutor and his official are\nexpected to be impartial and to protect the public interest with objectivity, take proper account-of the\nposition of the suspect and the victim, and pay attention to all relevant circumstances, irrespective of\nwhether they are to the advantage or disadvantage of the suspect.25 However, they aver that, from the way\nthe law setting up the Special Prosecutor's Office was couched, this was not the role envisaged for the\nOffice of the Special Prosecutor. They state that the Proclamation made the Special Prosecutor more of a\n\"persecutor\" than \"prosecutor\" and that it was obvious based on the Proclamation that the Special\nProsecutor began the prosecution and investigation of the cases against the complainants on the basis that\nthey were already guilty and needed to prove their innocence.\nb. statements made by the Respondent State officials during and after the trial of the Victims violate the\nviolates the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(l)(b) of the African Charter.\n136. The Complainants state that Dergue officials were treated as if they were guilty of the offences with\nwhich they were charged even before their guilt was established by a competent court. They argue that\nstatements from, the Respondent State at the pre-trial and trial period clearly demonstrate the\ngovernment's hostility and bias towards the Victims.\n137. The Complainants state that while the SPO gathered evidence and the Respondent State trained and\nappointed judges, the former Dergue Officials were subjected to 'massive media propaganda and untold\ndefamation by top government officials and their cadres'.26 They state that the SPO repeatedly appealed to\nthe public through the Government media and promise to pay compensation, house rent and jobs to people\nwho were willing to testify against the former Dergue Officials. It states that workshops and mass\ndemonstrations were organized and red-terror - victims committees set up to help in gathering evidence\nagainst the former Dergue Officials. They say that Prime Minister Meles Zenawi also repeatedly stated that\nhaving the former Dergue Officials punished was part and parcel of their armed struggle and that whatever\nthese officials did in hours of darkness 'would be retaliated through the courts and in the manner he so\ndesires in broad daylight'\n138. The Complainant also state that talking to the New York Times about the activities of the Dergue\nregime, the Special Prosecutor Girma Wakjira stated that \"it was not simply eliminating your enemy, it was\nshowing savagery at its utmost.\" 27 They stated that the hostility and bias continued even after trial and in a\nletter addressed to the Minster External Affairs, the Special Prosecutor stated; \"The genocide started as\nsoon as the Derg [sic] came to power and only stopped in May 1991, when the Derg [sic] was military (sic)\ndefeated and removed from power.28\n139. Quoting the Respondent State submissions on the Merit, they observe that its own submissions\ndisclose that: \"All these unlawful acts were committed in violation of the existing domestic laws of the\ncountry and relevant international obligations of Ethiopia, These heinous criminal acts were committed in\nextremely sophisticated and covert circumstances. What makes the Dergue very unique is that it continued\nits atrocious acts up to its overthrow in May 1991.\"29\n140. It says that the Respondent State's brief goes on to outline the 'grave human rights violations',\n'multitude of crimes committed against humanity', 'heinous criminal acts', 'heinous crimes of genocide and\ncrimes against humanity' committed all over Ethiopia by the Dergue regime.\n141. The Respondent State argues that faced with such 'heinous' and 'grave??? 'crimes against humanity'\nand genocide, the Respondent State took it for granted that the Victims were guilty and even portrayed\n16\n\n\fthem as 'criminals' even before they were tried. They further argue that the officials of Respondent State\ndid not conceal their bias against the victims and the Special Prosecutor and his officials saw their task as\nprosecuting criminals thereby violating the principle on presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 7 (1)\n(d) of the Charter. They aver that the Dergue Trials looked more as revenge when \"the ultimate\ndesideratum should be to engrave the rule of law into the social fabric of Ethiopian society\".30\nc. Excessive long preventive detention or pre-trial imprisonment is a violation the right to be presumed\ninnocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\n142. The Complainants submit that the procedure adopted by the Respondent State in bringing the\naccused persons to justice failed to assign blame within a reasonable length of time. The Complainants\nargue that the Victims were detained for three years before their trial finally started in 1994. They state that\nthe trial dragged on for more than thirteen years before a final judgment was reached in 2007. It avers that\npre-trail detention of the Victims and their long continuous detention even after they were charged\nessentially meant substituting pre-trial detention for their punishment. They state that their long preventive\ncustody thus lost its purpose as an instrument to serve the interests of sound administration of justice. They\nalso argues that the prolonged imprisonment without conviction of the Victims for a period of about 16\nyears clearly violates their right to be presumed innocent in that it was meant as a sanction prior to the\ndelivery of the judgment. The Complaint concludes that it is safe to say that the Victims were criminally\npunished by presuming their guilt even before they were heard, in violation of the principle of presumption\nof innocence established in Article 7 (1) (b) of the African Charter, Article XX of the Universal Declaration\nand rule XXX of the Principles and Guidelines on fair trial.31\nAlleged Violation of Article 7(1 )(d) - right to have ones cause heard\n\nArticle 7(1 )(d) of the African Charter states: (d) the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial\ncourt or tribunal.\n143. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has violated the former Derg [sic] offcial's right to\na fair trial by deliberately denying them the right to be tried by an impartial court within a reasonable time as\nenshrined in Article 7(d) of the African Charter.\n144. The right to an impartial hearing within a reasonable time is one of the cardinal elements the right to a\nfair trial. The Article is specially designed to ensure that the charges which the penal procedure places on\nthe individual are not unremittingly protracted and do not produce permanent harm. An individual who is\naccused and held in custody is entitled to have his or her case resolved on a priority basis and conducted\nwith diligence.\n145. With regards to the Dergue trials, the Complainants submit that even though several causes have\nbeen attributed for delays in the trials, none of these causes are attributable to the former Dergue Officials.\nThe Complainant state that the delay in rendering a judgment was therefore not due either to negligence or\nlack of interest on the part of the Victims rather, to the inactivity and failure of the State to proceed with the\ncases against the complainants with the diligence required and without due delay. They aver that the\nDergue officials, had their rights violated for several years and the Respondent State failed to put failed to\nput in place the necessary structures for them to be tried expeditiously. They state that the causes for the\ndelay include the following:\n\na. Dismantling of the Ethiopian Court system by the Government\nb. ambitious nature of the transitional justice Ethiopia pursued\nc. absence of appropriate legal checkpoints\nd. joinder of cases and accused persons\ne. the charges were not clear and specific which hampered their speedy trial\n\n17\n\n\ff. other causes of delays in the Dergue trials Dismantling of the Ethiopian Court system by the Government\n146. The Complainants state that immediately upon seizing power, the new Respondent State dismantled\nalmost all state institutions, including the court system, by summarily dismissing close to 300 judges on the\nalleged ground that tip judiciary had been an ally to the Dergue regime. Consequently they aver\nRespondent State could not afford a speedy trial to the Dergue official due to shortage of judges. It argues\nthat there were many instances where cases were adjourned for lack of quorum of judges.\n147. The Complainants aver that at the beginning, the Special First Bench of the Federal High Court,\ncomposed of three Judges, was exclusively dealing with the trial of the Dergue officials. However, from the\nyear 2001 there to the end of the trial date, it has been additionally charged with the equally complicated\nand numerous anticorruption cases, thereby reducing significantly the amount of time the Bench could\ndevote to the Dergue officials' trials. This additional assignment, it argues, was given to the Bench when\nthe judicial authorities were fully aware of the fact that the Bench was exclusively constituted for the trial of\nthe Dergue officials and that their trials have not been concluded ages after they were charged.\nAmbitious Nature of the Transitional Justice Ethiopia Pursued\n148. The complainants aver that another cause is the ambitious nature of the model of transitional justice\nEthiopia pursued. The SPO was established with two mandates: (1) to establish for public knowledge and\nfor posterity a historical record of the abuses of the Mengistu regime and (2) to bring those criminally\nresponsible for human rights violations and/or corruption to justice.32 They say from these two it was very\nclear that the SPO gave more attention and priority to its first mandate.33\n149. By the opening of the trials in December 1994, the SPO had gathered. 309,215 pages of relevant\ngovernment documents, many with clear signatures of high ranking officials.34 They state that in addition to\nthis kind of documentation, forensic teams continued searching for and exhuming dozens of mass graves\nwhich allegedly contained the bodies of murdered civilians. They said that the SPO stated in February 1994\nthat it had \"tens [sic] times more evidence than needed to successfully prosecute several of the detained\nand many of the exiles for serious criminal offenses.\" By August 1998, the Complainants allege, the SPO\npresented five hundred prosecution witnesses and warned that he had another five hundred to go. The\nComplainants argue that the SPO, therefore, insisted on and indeed introduced thousands of witnesses\nwhile a smaller number could establish and prove the charges against the former Dergue Officials. They\nargue that with such extensive documentary evidence, one thousand prosecution witnesses is excessive\nand unduly infringes upon the right of the accused to a fair and speedy trial. They aver that the SPO did not\nhave to wait until it gathered 'ten times' more evidence to try the complainants bearing in mind the fact that\nthey remained in detention throughout the investigation and trial of their cases.\nAbsence of Appropriate Legal Checkpoints\n150. The Complainants stated that the absence of appropriate legal checkpoints that could force the\nRespondent State to diligently and expeditiously work to investigate, charge and conduct trials also\ncontributed to the delay. The states that the right to petition for writ of habeas corpus, for example, was not\navailable to many of the victims and the statute of limitation with regard to the crimes the victims were\nalleged to have committed was removed.35\nJoinder of Cases and Accused Persons\n151. The Complainants state that Articles 116 and 117 of the Ethiopian Criminal Procedure Code provide\nfor joinder of charges and accused persons. They state that even through joinder per se is permissible,\nwhere there is conflict of interest that may cause serious prejudice to the accused or to the interest of\njustice, which is the case with the Dergue trial, the court should order separate trials. They aver, for\ninstance, that if the joinder of accused persons would cause undue delay to the trials of others, the court\nshould not permit joinder and, if any, it should order for separate trials. They argue that in the Dergue\nTrials, the SPO brought cases joining several accused and counts together. They state that more than\nseventy accused persons were charged with numerous counts. They argue that one could find one\naccused charged with only one count while another accused in the same file charged with many counts.\n152. The Complainants also state that the Dergue trials were also delayed because of the problem of\njoinder of cases, especially when it came to the hearing of witnesses. They state that where an accused\nperson who was jointly charged with others was absent for various reasons, the other co-accused persons\nwould have no option but to wait for his return because that accused person had the right to be tried in his\npresence and to cross-examine witnesses called in his case. They also state that where an accused who\n18\n\n\fwas jointly charged with the other accused persons was tried other accused persons was tried in absentia,\nthe other accused persons were also obliged to wait until all the evidence was concluded, including the\nevidence adduced against accused person(s) tried in abstentia. They argue that these situations led to\nperiodic adjournments of the case and thereby caused delays for the rest of the accused persons. The\nComplainants argue that the Dergue trials were, therefore, unduly delayed mainly because of the numerous\nadjournments occasioned by the joinder of the accused persons and the cases against them. They state\nthat a large number of charges were unnecessary to secure a conviction because it created unnecessary\ndelay in processing those defendants as well as those waiting for trial.\nThe charges were not Clear and Specific which Hampered their Speedy Trial\n153. The Complainants state that the charges filed against the Dergue officials were not clear and specific\nand this hampered their speedy trial. In many respects, the indictments were not as clear and succinct as\nthey needed to be for the accused to understand them. They state that this is a defect that goes to the form\nof the indictment and a violation of Article 111 and 112 of the Ethiopian Criminal Procedure Code.36 It says\nthat Jpg SPO, for example, filed charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes against\nthe former high-level Dergue Officials.\n154. The Complainants say that the accused were held for the murder of 1,823 persons, causing grave\nbodily injury to ninety-nine persons and the disappearance of 194 individuals. The Complainants say that\nthe original Ethiopian indictments written in Amharic were more than two hundred pages long and alleged\n211 criminal counts. They state that according to the indictment, persons who allegedly committed\n\"offenses\" cited in the Proclamation were charged with violations of Articles 281 and 286 of the Ethiopian\nPenal Code, which provides for the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, and incitement to genocide\nand crimes against humanity. They further state that in the alternative, the defendants were charged with\naggravated homicide under Article 522 of the Ethiopian Penal Code, grave willful injury under Article 538,\nabuse of power under Article 414 and unlawful arrest or detention under Article 416. It states that the\nindictments further accused the defendants of establishing themselves as a provisional military council or\ngovernment and setting up committees and sub-committees for the purpose of committing genocide and\ncrimes against humanity against various political groups whom the accused referred to as \"anti-people\" and\n\"counter-revolutionary\" in violation of Article 32 and 281 of the Penal Code of Ethiopia.\n155. The Complainants further state that the indictments alleged that the defendants incited and\nencouraged people to massacre thousands of members of different political groups in violation of Articles\n32(l)(a) and 286(a) of the Penal Code. They argue that the fundamental problem with these indictments\nwas that the details of the crimes were unclear because several concepts and legal doctrines were lumped\ntogether in one very long sentence.\nOther Causes of Delays in the Dergue Trials\n156. The Complainants state apart from the above, there were other factors which caused the delays.\nFirstly, there was a delay by the Respondent State to decide how to handle the matter. They argue that the\nRespondent State made its decision to take the matter through the legal machinery after having arrested\nthe former government officials for more than one year. When the Special Prosecutors Office was\nestablished, they say, some ex-officials had been jailed for 18 months without charges, taking almost five\nyears for the prosecution finally to come up with a charge of genocide against the majority of the\ndefendants. They say that even after the opening of the case against the Victims before the court there\nwere still some problems associated with the prosecution. It also states that the failure of the prosecution to\npresent evidence on time was the major problem. They aver that though the prosecutor gathered the\nnecessary exhibits and they are found in its control, it was common to see the Prosecutor asking the court\nfor additional adjournment to present them.\n157. They submit that the Respondent State should be found liable for violating Article 7 (1) (d) of the\nCharter in the absence of evidence from it attributing the delay to the negligence or lack of interest of the\ncomplainants. They note that since the conduct of the Dergue officials has not contributed to slowing down\nthe proceedings, the delay in the proceedings can be only attributed to the Respondent State, they argue\nthat the long and unnecessary delay in the Dergue Trials was occasioned by the inactivity and failure of the\nRespondent State to proceed with the trials with the diligence required and without undue delay.\n158. They conclude that the Victims were entitled to have their case decided expeditiously and with priority\nby the national authorities. They urge the African Commission to find for the Victims that the length of time\nfor which they had been held in custody pending trial and the number of years it took for the trial court to\n19\n\n\fcome up with a judgment on the merits to be excessive and unreasonable in the light of the Respondent\nState's constitutional principles and international commitments. This they say is in line with national and\ninternational jurisprudence, including that of the African Commission, on the matter.\nRespondent State's Submissions on the Merits\n\n159. The Respondent State for its part argues that local remedies are yet to be exhausted. It argues that\nthe Complainants have not yet completed the local remedies available to them and therefore submit that it\nis sufficient ground for dismissing the Communication.\n160. The Respondent State further alleges that there is no conflict between the Penal Code of Ethiopia and\nthe International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It argues that\nthe Complainant have made a lengthy argument regarding a conflict between Article 281 of me Penal Code\nof Ethiopia and the 1948 International Convention on the Prevention and Punishments of Crimes of\nGenocide to which Ethiopia is party and argue that their acts would not constitute a criminal act.\n161. The Respondent State further argues that firstly, the Complainants were wrong in arguing that political\ncrimes should be seen as out of the purview of the Conventions as the Conventions do not prohibit\nanywhere in its provisions the inclusion of broader definitions under national laws. It underlines the fact that\nfrom the outset, the Penal Code was issued in 1957 well before the Dergue came to power and was not\ntargeting any specific political or other group of Dergue Regime.\n162. Secondly, the Respondent State underlines the fact that the Dergue officials have not denied that they\nhave extra-judicially killed and harmed innocent civilians and that they were committing the crimes '\nviolation of the existing criminal law to stay in power. It is worth emphasizing, the Respondent stale\nsubmits, that the Dergue amended the Penal Code in 1982 and issued a Special Penal Code through\nProclamation No.114/1982 and did not bother to amend this part of the Penal Code including the provision\nthey are contesting hereunder. The Respondent State explains that the Dergue were applying the Penal\nCode in Ethiopia until the downfall of their regime and contested its application when it was found that it\ncame to regulate their past criminal activities.\n163. Thirdly the Respondent State argues that the Federal High Court had rejected, with the appropriate\nlegal reasoning, when the Complainants raised the Penal Code in their preliminary objections during the\ntrial and finally, the Respondent State argue that even if one could allege that there could be a conflict\nbetween the Penal Code and the Convention, this type of interpretation shall be the mandate of the House\nof Federation in accordance with Article 62(1) and 83(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Ethiopia.\nThus the Respondent State submits that the African Commission cannot replace national remedies\nmechanism for local remedies and could not be regarded as a tribunal substituting national court.\n164.The Respondent State further argue that full judicial independence is guaranteed by domestic laws\nEthiopia as is provided for in Article 78 of the Constitution. It argues that in the Constitution further\nguarantees in Article 78(4) that special or ad hoc court which takes judicial powers away from the regular\ncourts or institutions legally empowered to exercise judicial functions and which do not follow legally\nprescribed procedure shall not be established. The Constitution, the Respondent State submits, also\nguarantees in Article 79(2) and (3) that the courts from any level shall be free from interference by\ngovernment or any other source and that the judges shall exercise their functions in full independence and\nshall be directed solely by law.\n165. The Respondent State says that every person in Ethiopia has the right to access impartial and\nindependent courts and judges having jurisdiction over any alleged infringements including violations of\nhuman rights. It further submits that the Complainants' submission regarding the partiality of Ethiopian\njudiciary is unfounded and not substantiated by any evidence whatsoever.\n166. The Respondent State maintains that the African Commission should dismiss the Communication on\nthe following grounds:\no For lack of exhaustion of local remedies because the subject matter of the petition before the African\nCommission is still pending before a national court and entertaining it will interfere in the appeal and might\nlead to contradictory findings with the Supreme Court;\no The Communication lacks Locus Standi because the Communication does not have a legal basis;\no The allegation that elimination of political groups that was perpetrated all over the country on a\n20\n\n\flarge-scale does not constitute genocide, fails to pass the criteria for criminal act constituting genocide and\nthat the line of argument of the Complainants concerning the inconsistency between the Penal Code of\nEthiopia and the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishments of the Crime of Genocide\ndoes not hold water. According to the Respondent State, if there arises a conflict, the matter should be\nreferred to the House of Federation in accordance with the Constitution of Ethiopia;\no It mentions the African Commission's Communication Procedure which clearly stipulates that a\nCommunication which does not illustrate prima facie violations of the African Charter by invoking specific\nprovisions of the Charter shall not be examined. In this regard the Respondent State underscores that a\nnumber of Communications presented to the African Commission were rejected because Communications,\nwhile they cited provisions in the UN texts failed to make any reference to the provisions of the African\nCharter.37\n167. The Respondent State also refer to the African Commission's Guidelines on Submitting\nCommunications, where applicants are expected to indicate the courts where they sought domestic\nremedies and must attach judgments, writs of habeas corpus and other relevant documents. They submit\nthat the Complainants have not attached any such evidences and documents and therefore their\napplication fails to comply with the Guidelines for Communication to the African Commission.\n168. Finally the Respondent State argues that under paragraph 23 of the Complainants' letter to the\nChairperson of the African Commission, their prayer of relief makes it very clear that the Complainants do\nnot see the African Commission as a source of their relief but are rather seeking the establishment of\nanother impartial independent investigative body, which is not within the mandate of the African\nCommission.\n169. The Respondent State therefore request the African Commission to dismiss Communication 301/05\nas unfounded for the foregoing reasons. The African Commission's Decision on the Merits.\n\nThe African Commission's Decision on the Merits\n170. The Complainants base their claims against the Respondent State on the violations of Articles 1, 2,\nand 7(l)(b)(d) of the African Charter.\n171. Alleged Violation of Article 1: Article 1 of the African Charter requires all the States Parties to the\nCharter to recognize the rights guaranteed therein and to adopt legislative and other measures to give\neffect to these rights, duties and freedoms.\n172. Alleged Violation of Article 2: Article 2 of the African Charter further imposes a duty on States\nparties to the African Charter to ensure that every individual enjoys the rights and freedoms recognized and\nguaranteed in the Charter without distinction of any kind such as race, ethnic group, color, sex, language,\nreligion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or other status.\n173. The Complainants discuss two Articles together. They argue that the Respondent State's failure to\nrecognize the rights of the former Dergue Officials enshrined in The African Charter violates Articles 1 and\n2 of the African Charter.\n174. The Complainants' argue that Article 1 gives the African Charter a legally binding character38 while\nArticle 2\"abjures discrimination on the basis of any grounds set out, among them \"language... national or\nsocial origin... birth or other status...\"39 it argues that States Parties to the African Charter are obliged not\nonly to recognize the rights, duties and freedoms enshrined in it and to undertake to adopt legislative and\nother measures to give effect to them, but also to ensure that these rights are available to all without\ndiscrimination. Thus, by ratification, it argues, States are obligated to diligently undertake the harmonization\nof their legislation with the provisions of the Charter.40 Where a State neglects to protect the rights in the\nCharter, this can constitute a violation, even if the State or its agents are not the immediate cause of the\nviolation.41\n175. The Complainants state that the Respondent State ratified the African Charter on 15 June 1998 and is\nobligated to give effect to the rights guaranteed therein, without discrimination. They argue that as stated by\nthe Commission in Purohit and Moore/The Gambia,42 'when a state ratifies the African Charter it is\nobligated to uphold the fundamental rights contained therein. Otherwise if the reverse were true, the\nsignificance of ratifying a human rights treaty would be seriously defeated.'\n176. They argue that by failing to respect the Victim's right to a fair and speedy trial guaranteed in Article 7\nof the African Charter, the Respondent State is in violation of Article 1 and 2 of the African Charter. They\nfurther state that a violation of any provision of the African Charter automatically means a violation of Article\n21\n\n\f1.43\n177. The African Commission notes that in its submission of the Merits, the Respondent State did not\nspecifically address the allegation made against it that it had violated Articles 1 and 2 of the African\nCharter.\n178. According to the African Commission's long- standing practice, in cases of human rights violations, the\nburden of proof rests on the government (See, ACHPR/59/91, ACHPR/60/91, ACHPR/64/92, 68/92, 78/92,\nACHPR/87/ 93, ACHPR /101 / 93).44 If the government provides no evidence to contradict an allegation of\nhuman rights violation made against it, the Commission will take it as proven, or at the least probable or\nplausible. On the information available, the Commission considers that there was a violation of Articles 1\nand 2 of the African Charter.\n179. To reiterate in the instant matter if the government provides no evidence to contradict an allegation of\nhuman rights violation made against it, the African Commission will take it as proven, or at the least\nprobable or plausible. This principle conforms with the practice of other international human rights\nadjudicatory bodies and the African Commission's duty to protect human rights. Since the Respondent\nState did not respond to the allegations, the African Commission must, regrettably, come to a conclusion\nbased on the facts and opinions submitted by the Complainants.\nThe African Commission,\n180. Declares that the Respondent State has violated both Articles 1 and 2 of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 7(1 )(b) - right to have ones cause heard Article 7(1 )(b) of the African Charter\nstates: (b) the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\n181. The Complainants argue that Respondent State has violated the rights of the former Dergue officials\nto be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court. It argues that the presumption of\ninnocence is universally recognized45 and proclaimed by all major legal systems of the world.46 They state\nthat the Respondent State violated the right to be presumed innocent enshrined in Article 7 (1) (b) of the\nfollowing ways:\na. Proclamation No. 22/1992 which provides for the establishment of the special prosecutors [sic] office\nviolates the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1) of the African Charter.\n\nb. statements made by the Respondent State officials during and after the trial of the Victims violate the\nviolates [sic] the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\nc. Excessive long preventive detention or pre-trial imprisonment is a violation the the [sic] right to be\npresumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\nThe African Commission's Analysis on Article 7(1)(b)\n182. The Respondent State have not specifically addressed the allegation that Proclamation No. 22/1992\nviolated the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1)(b) of the African charter.\n183. It merely stated that after the Dergue regime was overthrown in 1991, cases had to be instituted in ten\nfederal and regional courts against 6000 defendants. It stated that the complexity of bringing all those\nresponsible for crimes committed during the Dergue regime would be a very daunting task. It stated that\ntaking into account the voluminous nature of the cases, the Transitional Government of Ethiopia\nestablished an independent body known as the Special Prosecutor's Office on 8 August 1992 by\nProclamation No 22/1992 for the purpose of conducting prompt investigation and bringing to trial arrestees\nas well as those persons responsible for having committed offences and at large within and outside the\ncountry.\n184. In its Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, the African\nCommission reiterated that everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed\ninnocent until proved guilty according to law. The presumption of innocence, the African Commission\nfurther stated, places the burden of proof during trial in any criminal case on the prosecution. In its\nResolution on the Right to Recourse and Fair Trial (1992), the African Commission further recognised the\nessential elements of a fair hearing to include, among other things, that persons charged with a criminal\noffence shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court.47\n\n22\n\n\f185. It is generally agreed that the presumption of innocence specifically entails that the person charged\nwith a crime must be treated, within and outside criminal proceedings, as being innocent until proven guilty.\nAs guaranteed in the African Charter, the principle constructs a presumption in favor of an individual\naccused of a crime according to which he or she is considered innocent until criminal responsibility is\nestablished in the case before the courts. In accordance with general opinion, which is also specifically\nconfirmed by the European Court on Human Rights, the presumption of innocence is available not only to\nthe defendant in the strictest sense of the word but also to an accused person prior to the filing of a criminal\ncharge. A person has this right 'until proved guilty according to law', i.e., until conviction becomes binding\nfollowing final appeal.48 The presumption applies during the pre-trial investigations and should be\nconsidered even stronger with regard to a person against whom 'not even a prima facie case has been\nconfirmed'.49\n186. The African Commission agrees with the Complainants that the principle of the presumption of\ninnocence constitutes a fundamental principle which protects everybody against being treated by public\nofficials as if they were guilty of an offence even before such guilt is established by a competent court. It\nagrees that the Proclamation setting up the Special Prosecutor Office in itself clearly presumed the\ncomplainants' guilt, thereby violating the principle of presumption of innocence. In Communication 224/98:\nMedia Rights Agenda v Nigeria, the African Commission agreed with the Complainant that that prior to the\nsetting up of the tribunal, the military Government of Nigeria organised intense pre-trial publicity to\npersuade members of the public that a coup plot had occurred and that those arrested in connection with it\nwere guilty of treason. The African Commission agreed further that any possible claim to national security\nin excluding members of the public and tire press from the actual trial by the tribunal cannot be justified,\nand therefore in breach of the right to fair trial, particularly, the right to presumption of innocence.\n187. As in the case of Communication 224/98: Media Rights Agenda v Nigeria, in the instant matter the\nRespondent State has not really contested the veracity of the Complainant's allegation. In this\ncircumstance, the African Commission is obliged to accept this as the he Respondent State in violation of\nArticle 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\n188. Again, the Respondent State have not specifically addressed the allegation that Proclamation No\n22/1992 violated the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(l)(b) of the African Charter.\nStatements made by the Respondent State officials during and after the trial of the victims violate the\nviolates [sic] the right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed in Article 7(l)(b) of the African Charter. The\nRespondent State has not specifically addressed the allegation in the Proclamation.\n189. The Respondent State have not addressed the allegation that statements made by the Respondent\nState officials during and after the trial of the Victims violate the violates [sic] the right to be presumed\ninnocent as guaranteed in Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\n190. The presumption of innocence implies a right to be treated in accordance with this principle. In Civil\nLiberties Organisation, Legal Defence Centre, Legal Defence and Assistance Project v Nigeria the African\nCommission stated that the principle of the presumption of innocence constituted a fundamental principle,\nwhich protects everybody against being treated by public officials as if they were guilty of an offence even\nbefore such guilt is established by a competent court.50 By reason of the presumption of innocence, the\nburden of proof of the charge is on the prosecution and the accused has the benefit of the doubt. No guilt\nshould be presumed until a charge has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is, therefore, a duty for all\npublic authorities to refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial. The African Commission has found a\nviolation of the right to be presumed innocent based on a State's negative pre-trial publicity. In the above\nmentioned case of Media Rights Agenda/Nigeria, the African Commission agreed with the Complainant that\nadverse negative publicity violated the defendants' rights to fair trial.\n191. In Law Office of Ghazi Suleiman/ Sudan51 , the African Commission again examined the right to\npresumption of innocence. Here, the complainant alleged that high-ranking government officials and\ninvestigators had publicly asserted the defendants' guilt. Furthermore, it was alleged that\ngovernment-orchestrated publicity stated that the defendants were behind a coup attempt against the state.\nSudan did not conceal its bias against the defendants showing 'open hostility towards the victims by\ndeclaring that 'those responsible for the bombings' will be executed'. Because Sudan had publicly\npre-judged the defendants before a proper court had established their guilt, the African Commission found\nthat the State had violated the right to be presumed innocent under Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\n192. This position of the African Commission is further reinforced by its Principles and Guidelines on the\nRight to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, where it stated that: 'Public officials shall maintain a\npresumption of innocence. Public officials, including prosecutors, may inform the public about criminal\n23\n\n\finvestigations or charges, but shall not express a view as to the guilt of any suspect'. The African\nCommission agrees with the Complainant that the Dergue officials were treated as if they were guilty of the\noffences with which they were charged even before their guilt was established by a competent court. It\nagrees that statements by the Respondent State at the pre-trial and trial period clearly demonstrate the\ngovernment's hostility and bias towards the Victims.\n193. In its General Comment on Article 14, the Human Rights Committee stressed the duty of all public\nauthorities to 'refrain from prejudging the outcome of a trial'.52 In particular, the Committee held that\nministers or other influential government officials may, in this respect commit a violation of Article 14 (2)\n× Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty\naccording to law.\nof the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In the case of excessive 'media justice' or tire\ndanger of impermissible influencing of lay or professional judges by other powerful social groups, one also\nhas to assume that the State is under a corresponding positive duty to ensure the presumption of\ninnocence.53 Similarly, in the Inter-American case of Juan Humberto Sanchez vs. Honduras54 , it was held\nthat the right of the victim to presumption of innocence, set forth in Article 8(2)\n× 2. Every person accused of a criminal offense has the right to be presumed innocent so long as his guilt\nhas not been proven according to law. During the proceedings, every person is entitled, with full equality, to\nthe following minimum guarantees:\na. the right of the accused to be assisted without charge by a translator or interpreter, if he does not\nunderstand or does not speak the language of the tribunal or court;\nb. prior notification in detail to the accused of the charges against him;\nc. adequate time and means for the preparation of his defense;\nd. the right of the accused to defend himself personally or to be assisted by legal counsel of his own\nchoosing, and to communicate freely and privately with his counsel;\ne. the inalienable right to be assisted by counsel provided by the state, paid or not as the domestic law\nprovides, if the accused does not defend himself personally or engage his own counsel within the time\nperiod established by law;\nf. the right of the defense to examine witnesses present in the court and to obtain the appearance, as\nwitnesses, of experts or other persons who may throw light on the facts;\ng. the right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself or to plead guilty; and\nh. the right to appeal the judgment to a higher court.\nof the American Convention, was breached, as the head of the armed forces repeatedly referred to the\nvictim as \"noticing other than a criminal.\"\n194. The African Commission agrees with the existence of a growing suspicion of a person in the course of\nthe criminal proceeding is not per se contrary to the principle of presumption of innocence. Neither is the\nfact that such mounting suspicion justifies the adoption of safeguard--such as pre-trial incarceration--in\nregard to the suspect's person. However, these must be implemented with the 'discretion and\ncircumspection necessary to respect the presumption of innocence'. As stated by the African Commission\nin its 'Principles and Guidelines on the Right to fair and Legal Assistance in Africa', public officials, are\nallowed to inform the public about criminal investigations or charges, but shall not express a view as to the\nguilt of any suspect. 55\n195. In the instant matter the Respondent State has again not contested the veracity of the Complainant's\nallegation. The African Commission is thus obliged to accept this as the facts of the case and therefore\nfinds Respondent State in violation of Article 7(l)(b) of the African Charter.\n196. Unlike the above two strands of how article 7(b) had been violated, the Respondent State attempted to\naddress the allegation of excessive long prevention detention or pre-trial imprisonment.\n197. In its submission, the Respondent State informs the African Commission that taking into consideration\nthe volume of the cases under review and the time it would require to adjudicate on it, the Federal Supreme\n24\n\n\fCourt, as the highest organ in charge of the administration of justice in the country, was obliged to allocate\na special Bench in the Criminal Divisions of the Federal High Court. It says that this was done to facilitate\nthe process of fair and speedy trial in accordance with Article 19 (4) of the 1995 Constitution of the Federal\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia and the Criminal Procedure Code of Ethiopia. It stated that the process of\nallocating dedicated benches was pursued even within the criminal divisions of regional courts. In this\nregard, perpetrators of genocide crimes were being tried in courts in different parts of the country.\n198. The Respondent State argues that Government even provided competent legal counsels to\ndefendants at its own cost when they are unable to do so themselves, all in an attempt to facilitate the trial\nprocess as expeditiously as possible and respect the rights of the defendants for fair and speedy trial.\n199. The Respondent State argues that after charges were filed, the defendants were then informed of the\nparticulars of charges brought against them. It says that copies of the charge were given to them and the\ncharges read to them as prescribed by the relevant provisions of the criminal procedure Code of Ethiopia. It\nsays that the defendants in exercise of their rights to challenge the charges brought against them in\naccordance with Article 300 of the Criminal Procedure Code submitted their respective preliminary\nobjections to the charges, which amounted to about 800 pages of preliminary objections.\n200. The Respondent State says that the Special Prosecutor was then asked by the court to reply to the\npreliminary objections - and the whole process of reviewing all the preliminary objections and replies and\nthe adjudication of the preliminary objections took the court about one year, that is, from November 1995 to\nSeptember 1996. The Respondent state avers that after examining the defendants preliminary objections to\nthe charges and replies of the Special Prosecutor, the Court dismissed most of the objections during its\nhearing on 9 October 1994 and ordered amendments of some of the charges.\n201. It stated that the Special Prosecutor then amended the charges as per the court order and filed the\namended charges to the court in November 1994. It says that the charges were again read out to the\ndefendants by the court and they were asked to enter their plea. All of them pleaded not guilty. It says that\nthereafter, the court ordered the Special Prosecutor to present its documentary evidences and witnesses. It\nsays that the Prosecutor submitted a list of 2500 witnesses and the hearing of witnesses started in January\n1996.\n202. The Respondent State argues that defense lawyers cross-examined the witnesses presented by the\nProsecutor during the various levels examinations and it was not uncommon for a witness to come back to\nthe court for several weeks because of the endless cross- examinations by the defendants and their\ndefence counsels. It says that the court ordered the Special Prosecutor to present witnesses twice every\nweek on Tuesdays and Thursdays considering the length of time it took to examine one witness as well as\nthe large amount of evidences to be presented, an exercise which took many years.\n203. The Respondent State avers that in the year 2000, after presenting 726 witnesses, the Special\nprosecutor, convinced that justice would be delayed if the hearing all over the country continued, applied to\nthe court to stop the presentation of witnesses and started presenting other documentary evidences. It says\nthat the court accepted the application of the Special Prosecutor and the presentation of witnesses came to\nan end on June 2000. By then, the Respondent State avers, the Special Prosecutor had presented 2,500\ndocumentary evidences in 24 volumes with a 192 pages of explanation. In addition, it says, films, audios,\nand other technical evidences were presented against the defendants. However, the Respondent State\nsay, the defendants were also given the evidence presented against them according to Article 20 (4) of the\nFederal Constitution as well as the criminal Procedure Code. The presentation of evidence was completed\nin December 2001 and the court set a date to review the files and render its verdict.\n204. The Respondent State avers that after examining the charges and the evidence vis-?-vis the\nstatements of defence brought by the defendants, the court issued a 587- page verdict on 21 January\n2003, to prove the charges against the defendants. In its ruling, the Respondent State say, the court then,\ncalled on the defendants to start their defenses and informed them that they could make defense\nstatements in answer to the charges and call witnesses in their defence.\n205. It says that one-year after the court's ruling, on 15 December 2003, the defendants brought a list of\ntheir own three hundred witnesses and documentary evidences. It argues that each defendant was allowed\nto give his own testimony which was exceedingly long. The Respondent State says that 22 defendants\npresented 787 pages of documentary evidences, while those that opted to individually present their own\ndefence submitted 1,416 pages of evidences. It says that the whole process of hearing the defendants was\ncompleted on 5 January 2005, at which time the court had set a date for judgement. It avers that to render\nits [sic] judgment, the court had to cautiously review a total of 3703 pages of evidence presented by both\nsides.\n25\n\n\f206. The Respondent State argues that after examining the evidences provided by the parties, the court\nhad to cautiously review a total of 3,703 pages of evidences and written arguments. It says that on 11\nDecember 2006, the judgment written in 792 pages found all the defendants, except one, guilty of the\ncharges. It says that on 11 January 2007, the court found most of the defendants guilty as charged and\nsentenced them to twenty three years to life imprisonment. It also stated that as most were dissatisfied with\nthe judgement they lodged appeals in March 2007.\n207. As an accused person enjoys the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, it is only appropriate to\nestablish whether he or she is innocent or guilty as rapidly as possible. Proceedings should therefore be as\nexpeditious as possible, especially where the accused person is in prison. The African Commission is yet to\ncome up with a decision on the matter. However, Articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter enjoins the\nAfrican Charter enjoins the African Commission to draw inspiration from, inter alia, other international law\ninstruments and bodies.56 By virtue of this Article, therefore, the Commission can draw inspiration from the\ndecisions of and the Inter- American Commission and Court, particularly bearing in mind the similarities\nwithin the two systems.\n208. In the case of Dayra Maria Levoyer Jiménez v. Ecuador, the Inter-American Commission again\nemphasized a similar interpretation of the right to be presumed innocent under Article 8 (2)\n× 2. Every person accused of a criminal offense has the right to be presumed innocent so long as his guilt\nhas not been proven according to law. During the proceedings, every person is entitled, with full equality, to\nthe following minimum guarantees:\na. the right of the accused to be assisted without charge by a translator or interpreter, if he does not\nunderstand or does not speak the language of the tribunal or court;\nb. prior notification in detail to the accused of the charges against him;\nc. adequate time and means for the preparation of his defense;\nd. the right of the accused to defend himself personally or to be assisted by legal counsel of his own\nchoosing, and to communicate freely and privately with his counsel;\ne. the inalienable right to be assisted by counsel provided by the state, paid or not as the domestic law\nprovides, if the accused does not defend himself personally or engage his own counsel within the time\nperiod established by law;\nf. the right of the defense to examine witnesses present in the court and to obtain the appearance, as\nwitnesses, of experts or other persons who may throw light on the facts;\ng. the right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself or to plead guilty; and\nh. the right to appeal the judgment to a higher court.\nof the American Convention. It maintained that depriving Mrs. Levoyer Jimenez, the petitioner of her liberty\nfor a period that exceeded one half the maximum penalty established for the offence is a violation of the\nprinciple of presumption of innocence established in the American Convention. It noted that in the present\ncase the imposition of preventive detention for an indefinite period was tantamount to anticipating the\npunishment of Mrs Jiménez. The Commission held further that 'universally accepted general principles of\nlaw prohibit anticipating the punishment before sentencing'. Stressing the interrelatedness of anticipatory\npunishment and violation of the presumption of innocence, the Inter-American Commission found that\nEcuador had violated Jiménez's right to be presumed innocent.\n209. The African Commission agrees with the Complainants that the procedure adopted by the Respondent\nState in bringing the accused persons to justice failed to assign blame within a reasonable length of time.\nThe Victims were detained for three years before their trial finally started in 1994, Their trial dragged on for\nmore than thirteen years before a final judgment was reached in 2007. The pre-trail detention of the Victims\nand their long continuous detention even after they were charged essentially meant substituting pre-trial\ndetention for their punishment. The African Commission agrees that their long preventive custody thus lost\nits purpose as an instrument to serve the interests of sound administration of justice. The prolonged\nimprisonment without conviction of the Victims for a period of about 16 years clearly violates their right to\n26\n\n\fbe presumed innocent in that it was meant as a sanction prior to the delivery of the judgment. As held by\nthe Inter-American Court, the deprivation of a person's liberty for a disproportionate time is the same as\nserving a sentence in advance for of the judgment. The African Commission agrees with the Complainant\nthat the Victims were criminally punished by presuming their guilt even before they were heard, in violation\nof the principle of presumption of innocence established in Article 7(1) (b) of the African Charter, Article XX\nof the Universal Declaration and rule XXX of the principles and Guidelines on fair trial.57\nThe African Commission,\n210. Declares that the Respondent State has violated Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 7(1)(d) - right to have ones cause heard. Article 7(1)(d) of the African Charter\nstates: (d) the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\n211. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has violated the former Derg [sic] official's right to\na fair trial by deliberately denying them the right to be tried by an impartial court within a reasonable time as\nenshrined in Article 7(l)(d) of the African Charter.58 It states that the causes for the delay include the\nfollowing:\n\na. Dismantling of the Ethiopian Court system by the Government;\nb. ambitious nature of the transitional justice Ethiopia pursued;\nc. absence of appropriate legal checkpoints;\nd. joinder of cases and accused persons;\ne. the charges were not clear and specific which hampered their speedy trial;\nf. other causes of delays in the Dergue trials.\n212. The African Commission will now proceed to analyse Article 7(l)(d) of the African Charter under the\nabove rubrics to determine if a violation has occurred according to the allegation levied by the Complainant.\nDismantling of the Ethiopian Court System by the Government\n213. In their submission on the Merits, the Complainants argue that the Respondent State immediately\nupon seizing power, dismantled almost all state institutions, including the court system, by summarily\ndismissing close to 300 judges on the ground that the judiciary had been an ally to the Dergue regime.\nConsequently, they state, the Respondent State could not afford a speedy trial to the Dergue officials due\nto shortage of judges. It argues that there were many instances where cases were adjourned for lack of\nquorum of judges.\n214. The Respondent State did not address this allegation.\n215. The African Commission however, wishes to restate that the right to an impartial hearing within a\nreasonable time is one of the cardinal elements of the fair trial. Article 7(l)(d) of the African Charter not only\nprovides that person charged with a criminal offence has the right to be tried without undue delay / within a\nreasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal, but that an individual who is accused and held in custody\nis entitled to have his or her case resolved promptly.\n216. In its Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, the African\nCommission stated that anyone who is arrested on a criminal charge shall be brought before a judicial\nofficer authorized by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or\nto release. The purpose of the review before a judicial or other authority includes to assess whether\nsufficient legal reason exists for the arrest; assess whether detention before trial is necessary; determine\nwhether the detainee should be released from custody, and the conditions, if any, for such release;\nsafeguard the well-being of the detainee; prevent violations of the detainee's fundamental rights; give the\ndetainee the opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of his or her detention and to secure release if the\narrest or detention violates his or her rights.\n217. The right to an impartial hearing within a reasonable time is further reinforced by the Commission's\nResolution on Fair trial, which provides that persons arrested or detained or facing criminal charges shall\n27\n\n\fbe brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power and shall be\nentitled to trial within reasonable time or to be released.59 The African Commission is unable to determine\nwhether the delays in promptly concluding the trial in the instant case was due partly to the fact that the\nRespondent State dismantled almost all state institutions, including the court system, as the Respondent\nState has not specifically addressed this allegation.\n218. Accordingly, the African Commission is left with no alternative but to apply its long-standing practice\nthat if the government provides no evidence, as in the instant matter, to contradict an allegation of human\nrights violation made against it, it will take it as proven, or at the least probable or plausible.\nAmbitious Nature of the Transitional Justice Ethiopia Pursed\n219. The Complainants aver that justice was delayed and therefore denied by the very ambitious nature the\nmodel of transitional justice the Respondent State pursued. The Complainant allege that the SPO had\nstated in February 1994 that tens [sic] times more evidence than needed to successfully prosecute several\nof the detained and many of the exiles for serious criminal offences.\n220. Unfortunately, the Respondent State again chose not fully respond to this particular allegation. It\ncommented generally that because of the multitude of crimes committed against humanity all over the\ncountry and the complexity involved in bringing all those responsible for these crimes to justice, the task\nwould become, at the very least, daunting. In a statement that seem to support the allegation of the\nComplainant, the Respondent State said that during the trial process, while the total number of prosecution\nwitnesses presented in the Mengistu HaileMariam case alone was 726, those of the defendants were 303,\nmaking the total number of witnesses to be heard by the court to be 1029. It further stated that the\ndocumentary evidences presented by both parties and became heavily insurmountable when they\npresented their replies and counter-replies in addition to the original charges constituting the several\ncounts.\n221. Again applying its long-standing practice, that in cases of human rights violations, the burden of proof\nrests on the government, and where the government provides no evidence, as in the instant matter, to\ncontradict an allegation of human rights violation made against it, the Commission will take it as proven, or\nat the least probable or plausible.\nAbsence of Appropriate Legal Checkpoints\n222. The Complainants allege that the absence of appropriate legal checkpoints that could force the State\nto diligently and expeditiously work to investigate, charge and conduct trials also contributed to the delay.\nGiving the example of the right to petition for writ of habeas corpus was not available to many of the victims\nand the statute of limitation with regard to the crimes the victims were alleged to have Committed [sic] was\nremoved.\n223. The Respondent State did not fully address this allegation. It argued that full judicial independence in\nEthiopia as is guaranteed by domestic laws in Ethiopia as is provided for in Article 78 of the constitution. It\nargued that in the Constitution further guarantees in Article 78(4) that special or ad hoc courts which take\njudicial powers away from the regular court or institutions legally empowered to exercise judicial functions\nand which do not follow legally prescribed procedures be established. The Constitution, the Respondent\nState argues, also guarantees in Article 79(2) and (3) that the courts from any level shall be free from\ninterference by government or any other source and that the judges shall exercise their functions in full\nindependence and shall be directed solely by law.\n224. The Respondent State submit that after establishing the SPO, the Office undertook examining\ndetained defendants, requesting remand in custody to complete investigation and responding to habeas\ncorpus demands in the relevant courts. It did not say what the outcome was.\n225. Again applying its long-standing practice, that in cases of human rights violations, the burden of proof\nrests on the government, and where the government provides no evidence, as in the instant matter, to\ncontradict an allegation of human rights violation made against it, the Commission will take it as proven, or\nat the least probable or plausible.\nJoinder of Cases and Accused Persons\n226. The Complainants argue that though Articles 116 and 117 of the Ethiopian Criminal Procedure Code\nprovides for joinder of charges and accused persons, where there is conflict of interests that may cause\nserious prejudice to the accused or to the interests of justice, which is the case with the Dergue trials, the\ncourts should order separate trials.\n28\n\n\f227. The Respondent State did not address this allegation.\n228. Applying its long-standing practice, that in cases of human rights violations, the burden of proof rests\non the government, and where the government provides no evidence, as in the instant matter, to contradict\nan allegation of human rights violation made against it, the Commission will take it as proven, or at the least\nprobable or plausible.\nCharges were not Clear and Specific which Hampered their Speedy Trial\n229. The Complainants submit that the charges filed against the Dergue Officials were not clear and\nspecific which hampered their speedy trial. They argue that in many respects, the indictments were not as\nclear and succinct as they needed to be for the accused to understand them. They aver that this is a defect\nthat goes to the form of the indictment and a violation of Articles 111 and 112 of the Ethiopian Criminal\nProcedure Code.\n230. The Respondent State did not fully address this allegation. It merely stated that once the investigation\nwas completed, the Office of the SPO, began to charge the accused persons before the court of law. It\nstated that on 24 November 1994, the Office of the SPO brought a charge against Colonel Mengistu\nHailemariam et al at the Federal High court. There were also thousands of charges of arbitrary arrest and\nillegal confiscation of property brought against the defendants.\n231. An accused's ability to fully comprehend the charges brought against him is fundamental to a fair trial.\nIn the instant matter, the African Commission will also state that in such serious matter it is imperative that\nboth the accused and their counsel are able to fully understand the charges. The Complainants have for\nexample alleged that the fundamental problem with the indictments was that the details of the crimes were\nunclear because several concepts and legal doctrines were lumped together in one very long sentence.\nThe respondent state did not challenge that allegation.\n232. In its Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Fair Trial, the African Commission outlined the factors\nrelevant to what constitutes undue delay as including the complexity of the case, the conduct of the parties,\nthe conduct of other relevant authorities, whether an accused is detained pending proceedings, and the\ninterest of the person at stake in the proceedings. However, since the Respondent State chose not to fully\naddress this allegation, the Commission will take the allegation as proven, or at the least probable or\nplausible.\nOther Causes of Delays in the Dergue Trials\n233. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has also contravene Article 7(1)(d) by the failure\nof the Respondent State to decide how to handle the matter and the failure of the prosecution to present\nevidence on time was the major problem.\n234. The Complainants submit that what occurred in Ethiopia during the trial of the Dergue officials, was\nprejudice and lack of activity by the courts handling the cases and thus constituted a violation of Article 7\n(1) (d) of the Charter. They argue that the Respondent State was already aware of the facts and\nseriousness of the cases against the Dergue officials but failed to act with the due diligence required and,\nthereby violating their right to a speedy trial. They further argue that the nature of the violations against the\nVictims entitles them to relief. The African Commission agrees. In keeping with the spirit of Articles 7(1)(d)\nof the African Charter an accused person in detention is entitled to have his case given priority and\nexpedited by the proper authorities.\n235. The African Commission also agrees with the Complainants that the complexity of a case should not\ndebar domestic courts from acting with due diligence in dealing with a case on the Merits. 60 At any rate, it\nis the responsibilities of States Parties to the African Charter to organize their judiciary in such a way that\nthe right guaranteed in Article 7 (1) (d) of the Charter can be effectively enjoyed. In Mouvement Burkinabe\ndes Droits de I'Homme et des peuples/Burkina Faso61 the African Commission that l5 years without a\ndecision on the relief sought or the fate of the people concerned or any action at all on the case amounted\nto a denial of justice and a violation of the right to an impartial trial within a reasonable time. In Annette\nPagnoulle (on behalf of Abdoulaye Mazou) / Cameroon,62 the African Commission found the Cameroonian\nGovernment in violation of Article 7 (1) (d) of the Charter because Mr. Mazou did not have a judgment on\nhis case which was before the supreme Court for two years and he was not given any reason for the delay.\n236. Similarly in Alhassan Abubakar v Ghana63 , the African Commission held that detaining the\nComplainant for seven years without trial before his escape \"clearly violates the \"reasonable time\" standard\nstipulated in the Charter.\" In CRP v Nigeria64 , the Commission held, inter alia, that: in criminal case,\nespecially one in which the accused is detained until trial, the trial must be held with all possible speed to\n29\n\n\fminimize the negative effects on the life of a person who, after all, may be innocent. The Commission\nfurther held that since nearly two years can pass without even charges being filed there was an\nunreasonable delay and thus, the detainees rights under Article 7(1 )(d) were violated.\n237. Where there is unacceptable duration, it is the obligation of the Respondent State to adduce specific\nreasons for the delay. The African Commission agrees with the Complainant that the Respondent State has\nto prove that the case is complex to justify the delay under consideration. A mere affirmation that the delay\nwas not excessive, as in the instant case, is not sufficient. The African Commission further agrees with the\nComplainants that even if the Respondent State did not intend to delay the proceedings the African\nCommission can still review the prejudice the delay has caused the defendants.\n238. In its Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, the African\nCommission observed that 'no circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of war, a state of international\nor internal armed conflict, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked to\njustify derogations from the right to a fair trial'.65 In its Resolution on the Right to Recourse and Fair Trial,\nthe Commission again recognized the right to a fair trial as essential for the protection of fundamental\nhuman rights and freedoms and further recommended State Parties to the African Charter to create,\nawareness of the accessibility of the recourse procedure.66\n239. The Dakar Declaration and Recommendations on the Right to a Fair Trial in Africa adopted by the\nCommission at its 26th Ordinary Session, held in Kigali, Rwanda, from 1-15 November 1999 also reiterates\nthat: the right to a fair trial is a fundamental right, the non- observance of which undermines all other human\nrights. Therefore, the right to a fair trial is a non-derogable right, especially as the African Charter does not\nexpressly allow for any derogation from the rights it enshrines.67\n240. The realization of the right to a fair trial is dependent on the existence of certain conditions. These\ninclude:68 the right to an impartial hearing, trial within a reasonable time and the presumption of innocence.\nThe African Commission,\n\nDeclares that the Respondent State has violated the right of the Victims to be tried within a reasonable time\nby an impartial court or tribunal as recognized in Article 7(l)(d) of the African Charter.\n\nRecommendations\nIn view of the above, the African Commission finds that the Respondent State is in violation of Article\n7(1)(b) and (d) of the African Charter. The African Commission recommends that the Respondent State:\n\no Pay adequate compensation to the Victims for violation of their right to be presumed innocent until proved\nguilty by a competent court of tribunal and to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or\ntribunal as recognized in Article 7(1)(b)(d) of the African Charter.\no Report on the implementation of these recommendations within three months from the date of\nnotification.\nDone in Banjul, The Gambia during the 50th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human\nand Peoples' Rights, 24th October - 7th November 2011.\n\n30\n\n\fFootnotes\n1 Dergue means \"Council or Committee\" in Amharic and it is usually associated with the Mengistu regime\nthat toppled Haile-Sellasie' Monarchic regime in 1974, and ruled the country from 1974-1991.\n2 Communications No. 25/89, 47/90, 56/91, 100/93\n3 Communications 54/91, 61/91, 164/97 to 196/97, 210/98.\n4 Ibid, (Comm: 210/98) para 78.\n5 Communication 277/2003.

France, the applicant, a French\nnational, was arrested in connection with the murder of a member of parliament. That same day, at a press\nconference, the Minister for the Interior and senior police officers made several conclusory statements\nasserting that the applicant was an instigator in the murder. Two French television channels reported these\nstatements in their news programs. On 14 January 1977, the applicant was charged with aiding and\nabetting intentional homicide and taken into custody. In his complaint to the European Commission, the\n32\n\n\fapplicant claimed that the statements made by the Minister for the Interior violated his right to the\npresumption of innocence. In its defence, the government argues that the presumption of innocence could\nbe infringed only by judicial authorities. The European Court held, firstly, that right to presumption of\ninnocence secured by Article 6 (2) may be infringed by public authorities other than a judge or court.\nAccording to the Court's decision, Article 6 (2) does not prevent public authorities from discussing criminal\ninvestigation in progress, but it does require that they do so with the discretion and circumspection\nnecessary to respect the presumption of innocence. In the case at hand, the court found that the\ndeclaration of the applicant's guilt by some of the highest ranking police officials in the presence and under\nthe authority of the Minister for the Interior not only encouraged the public to believe the applicant to be\nguilty, but also prejudiced the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority.\n53 See General Comment 13, paragraph 11 and Manfred Nowak (See n 111 above, page 254).\n54 Series C No. 99 [2003] IACHR 2 (7 June 2003).\n55 See Rule N of the Commission's Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal\nAssistance in Africa.\n56 See for example Communication 211/98 - [211/98#58,Legal Resources Foundation/Zambia]], paragraph\n58 and communication 155/96 - The Social and Economic Rights Action Centre and the Centre for\nEconomic and Social Rights/Nigeria paragraph 48, 52, 57 and 63.\n57 See also Waldemer Geronimo Pinheiro and Jose Victor dos Santos v.

The Complainant, Michael Majuru (hereinafter called the Complainant), submitted this communication\nagainst the Republic of Zimbabwe, (hereinafter called the Respondent State), a State Party to the African\nCharter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the African Charter). The Complainant is a citizen of the\nRespondent State and is currently residing in the Republic of South Africa.\n2. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State has committed gross violations of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms against him through acts committed by the Minister of Justice, Legal and\nParliamentary Affairs and the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) under the Office of the President and\nCabinet.\n3. The Complainant alleges further that in committing the gross violations, the aforementioned\norganisations, individuals and organs of the state were acting in the course and scope of their employment\nas Respondent State's agents.\n4. The Complainant submits further that his rights were abused because of his role as a presiding judge in\na case in which the Associated Newspaper Group of Zimbabwe (ANZ), a publishing house in the\nRespondent State, sought to challenge, before the Administrative Court, the Respondent State's act on\nbanning ANZ from publishing its two newspapers, the Daily News and the Daily News on Sunday. The\nmatter was lodged before the Administrative Court on or about 23rd September 2003 and he presided over\nthe matter.\n5. The Complainant states that following his decision in favour of the ANZ, he became a target of human\nrights abuses brought upon him by agents of the Respondent State and recounts the chronology of events\nthat depict incidents in which the Respondent State allegedly violated his human rights.\n6. The first incident is reported to have occurred on or about 24th September 2003. It is alleged that the\nMinister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, the Hon. Patrick Chinamasa invited the Complainant's\nworkmate, who was also a judge at the Administrative Court (Justice Chipo Machaka) to his office to issue\ninstructions that the matter relating to the ANZ case that was to be presided over by the Complainant\nshould be conducted in a manner that the said Minister was going to dictate. Justice Machaka was\ninstructed by the Minister to convey these instructions to the Complainant, with an order that Complainant\nshould comply with such orders.\n7. It is further alleged that the Minister also instructed that the Administrative Court should delay the court\nproceedings until February 2004, noting that the ANZ did not deserve impartial treatment by the Judiciary\nbecause it was a front of western nations and 'other imperialists'. Secondly, Justice Machaka is alleged to\nhave been told that if the ANZ were granted its application for urgent appeal hearing and thereafter allowed\npublication at that stage this would jeopardise continuing negotiations between ZANU PF and the\nMovement for Democratic Change (MDC), (the biggest opposition party in Zimbabwe), which according to\nthe Minister, had reached a delicate stage. As proof of this delicate relationship between ZANU PF and\nMDC, Justice Machaka was shown a draft constitution agreed upon between the two parties and some\nother supporting documents.\n8. The Complainant submits that the he disregarded the aforesaid instructions and upon considering the\nANZ's application on its merits ruled in favour of the ANZ by granting the application for an urgent appeal\nhearing on or about 27th September 2003. From 15th to 19th October 2003, the Complainant presided over\nthe appeal hearing between the two parties. He adjourned the matter for judgement to 24th October 2003.\n9. Subsequently, the Complainant states that he was summoned by Enoch Kamushinda, a suspected\nmember of the CIO for a meeting at Kamushinda's office on 22nd October 2003. This information was\nconveyed through another CIO operative with instructions that the Complainant should dismiss the ANZ\nappeal. As a reward for dismissing the ANZ appeal, Kamushinda promised the Complainant a fully\ndeveloped farm in Mashonaland West Province.\n10. The Complainant further states that on 23rd October 2003 at around 21:00 hours, the Minister of\nJustice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Hon. Patrick Chinamasa, telephoned and enquired from the\nComplainant whether he had finalised the judgement in the ANZ matter and what decision he had reached.\nThe Complainant advised him that he was in the process of finalising the judgement and that he was going\nto allow the appeal. The Complainant states that the Minister expressed his displeasure with the said\ndecision and further attempted to unduly influence and/or threaten the Complainant.\n1\n\n\f11. The Complainant claims that he went ahead to deliver the judgement in favour of ANZ at about 1600\nhours on 24rd November 2003. Subsequently, at about 21:30 hours, Hon. Chinamasa in an angry\ntelephone call to the Complainant, accused the latter of pre-determining the matter and berated him for\ndelivering a judgement dictated by British agents and other imperialist forces.\n12. Subsequently, the Media and Information Commission (MIC) appealed to the Supreme Court against\nthe decision of the Administrative Court. ANZ on the other hand decided to approach the Administrative\nCourt seeking an order that its original decision be rendered operative notwithstanding the institution of an\nappeal by the MIC.\n13. The Complainant claims that upon the lodging of this application by the ANZ, the Complainant was\nplaced under immense pressure from agents of the Respondent State urging him to desist from dealing\nwith the matter. The Complainant claims that the Respondent sent members of the CIO to track, trial and\nmonitor the Complainant's movements and interactions with other people.\n14. The Complainant alleges that on several occasions he was approached by Ben Chisvo, a suspected\nCIO informer, a former ruling ZANU PF Councillor of the City of Harare and also a war veteran. Chisvo\nsought to persuade the Complainant to rescue himself from presiding over the matter, claiming that the\ncase was serious and sensitive and that President Mugabe did not want the ANZ to be registered. Chisvo\nfurther indicated that the President had set up a team led by a senior assistant commissioner of Zimbabwe,\nChangara, to monitor the proceedings in the ANZ matter and confirmed that the Complainant was being\nmonitored by state security agents.\n15. On 23rd November 2003, at around 23:00 hours, the Complainant received a telephone call from\nChisvo in which he claimed that his car had had a puncture close to the Complainant's residence and\nrequested for assistance. Upon meeting the Complainant, Chisvo demanded to know whether the former\nwould preside over the ANZ matter or excuse him as previously ordered. The Complainant informed Chisvo\nthat he would be presiding over the ANZ matter.\n16. The Complainant further alleges that, on 24th November 2003, following the Complainant's\npostponement on the ANZ matter upon the request of the two parties to the case, he received a telephone\ncall from Hon. Chinamasa at around 21:00 hours. The Complainant states that the Minister alleged that he\nhad information linking the Complainant to British agents and other imperialists and that the Complainant\nwas under investigation for these alleged links with the British agents and imperialists. The Minister also\nindicated that he was aware through his informants that the ANZ was going to succeed in the second\nmatter which was pending before the Complainant and advised him that the Minister of Justice had also\nphoned her ordering her to meet him at his office the following morning. She informed the Complainant that\nthe Minister wanted to be advised on how the Complainant intended to decide the ANZ matter in order for\nhim to brief the Cabinet that morning. Soon after the telephone call from Justice Machaka, the Minister\ntelephoned the Complainant once again ordering that they meet the following morning at his office at 08:00\nhours.\n17. On 25th November 2003, the Complainant met with the Minister as instructed. The Minister wanted to\nknow what the Complainant's decision in the ANZ matter would be but the Complainant declined to inform\nstating that he had not yet heard the parties' arguments on the matter and was therefore in no position to\nknow the outcome. The Complainant alleges that the Minister informed him that the Police Commissioner\nAugustine Chuchuri had approached him previous night with information that the Complainant was under\ninvestigation for colluding with British agents over the ANZ matter and was considering arresting him.\n18. The Minister is also reported to have shown the Complainant the Herald newspaper which carried an\narticle on its front page alleging that the Complainant was under probe over the ANZ matter. The Minister\nalso produced an affidavit, which he said had been obtained from Chisvo by the Police Commissioner. In\nthe said affidavit, Chisvo had made statements to the effect that the Complainant had informed Chisvo that\nthe ANZ matter was predetermined.\n19. The Complainant claims that as a result of such sustained and relentless pressure he had no other\noption but to excuse himself from the matter. Notwithstanding the recusal, the Complainant remained under\nsurveillance by state security agents.\n20. The Complainant states that on 1st December 2003, he received a telephone call from a member of the\nlegal fraternity and the Police informing him that the Respondent State was fabricating a case against him\nand that he was to be arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for defying the\nRespondent's orders.\n21. The Complainant alleges that fearing for his safety and security; he decided to go into hiding until 9th\nDecember when he fled to South Africa, where he remains in exile.\n2\n\n\f22. The Complainant submits that he is not the only member of the Judiciary who has been persecuted but\nthat there is a systematic, consistent and sustained pattern of interference with the Judiciary by the\nExecutive in the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\nComplaint\n23. The Complainants allege that Articles 3, 5, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 26 of the African Charter on Human\nand Peoples' Rights have been violated.\n24. The Complainant requests that the African Commission should:1. Urge the Respondent State to institute an inquiry and investigation that should result in the\nGovernment of Zimbabwe bringing those who perpetrated the violations to justice;\n2. Order the Respondent State to pay compensation for the physical pain, psychological trauma, loss\nof earnings and job and access to family suffered by the Complainant.\n\nProcedure\n25. The Communication is dated 2th November 2005 and was sent by email to the Secretariat, and was\nreceived on 8th November 2005.\n26. On 17th November 2005, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Communication and informed the\nComplainant that the communication would be scheduled for consideration by the African Commission at\nits 38th Ordinary Session.\n27. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nAfrican Commission considered the communication and decided to be seized of it.\n28. By Note Verbale dated 8th December 2005, the Secretariat transmitted a copy of the communication to\nthe Respondent State by DHL and requested it to forward its submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\nThe Complainant was also requested to send his submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\n29. By letter and Note Verbale dated 20th March 2006, the parties to the communication were reminded to\nforward their written submissions on admissibility of the communication.\n30. On 3rd April 2006, the Secretariat received submissions on admissibility of the communication from one\nGabriel Shumba. By letter dated 12th April 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to Gabriel\nShumba informing him that the communication had been brought before the African Commission by\nMichael Majuru who had never made any indication to the African Commission that Gabriel Shumba could\nmake representations on his behalf. This letter was also copied to the Complainant Michael Majuru.\n31. As at the 40th Ordinary Session there had been no reply from the Complainant. The communication\nwas therefore deferred to the 41st Ordinary Session pending the reply of the Complainant and Mr Shumba,\nas well as the Respondent State's submission on admissibility.\n32. By letter and Note Verbale dated 11th December 2006, written to the Complainant and Respondent\nState respectively, the parties were informed by the Secretariat, about the decision of the African\nCommission during its 40th Session, to consider the admissibility of the communication during its 41st\nSession. The parties were asked to send their submissions on admissibility within 3 months of receiving the\nletters.\n33. The Complainant sent an email on 18th December 2006, confirming that Zimbabwe Exiles Forum to\nwhich Gabriel Shumba is the Executive Director are his agents in the matter and that the Secretariat should\nacknowledge submissions made by them.\n34. By Note Verbale dated 4th January 2007, the Secretariat reminded the Respondent State of the\nCommission's decision during its 40th Ordinary Session, and asked them to make their submissions on\nadmissibility within 3 months of receipt of the notification. Another reminder by way of a Note Verbale dated\n10th April 2007 was also sent to the Respondent State.\n35. On 24th April 2007, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submission on admissibility. The\nRespondent State's submission was forwarded to the Complainant by email and he was asked to make\nadditional submissions (if any), in order to address some important points which were raised by the\nRespondent State in its submission.\n\n3\n\n\f36. During its 41st Ordinary Session, the African Commission decided to defer consideration of the\ncommunication to its 42nd Ordinary Session for its decision on admissibility.\n37. By letter ACHPR/LPROT/COMM/308/2005/ZIM/TN dated 20th July 2007 and by Note Verbale\nACHPR/LPROT/COMM/308/2005/ZIM/RE, with the same date, the parties were informed of the decision of\nthe African Commission to defer consideration of the communication to its 42th Ordinary Session.\n38. At its 42nd Ordinary session held in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, the Commission considered this\ncommunication and decided to defer further consideration into the 43rd Ordinary Session due to lack of\ntime.\n39. By Note Verbale of 19th December 2007 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat of the Commission\nnotified both panics of the Commission's decision.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\nComplainant's submission on admissibility\n\n40. The Complainant submitted that he has local standing before the African Commission as the\ncommunication is brought by himself, a citizen of Zimbabwe, the Respondent State in this matter.\nRegarding compatibility, the Complainant submitted that the communication raises a prima facie violation of\nthe African Charter committed by the Respondent State. He submitted further that the evidence he has\nsubmitted reveals that the communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated by the mass\nmedia, adding that it is based on first hand evidence - including reports by reputable human rights\norganisations.\n41. On the exhaustion of local remedies, the Complainant submitted that the onus is on the State to\ndemonstrate that remedies are available, citing the Commission's decisions in the cases of 71.921 and\n147.95-149.96,2 . The Complainant added that he remedy in his particular circumstance is not available\nbecause he cannot make use of it that he was forced to flee Zimbabwe for fear of his life and that of his\nimmediate family. Because of his work as a judge of the Administrative Court. That he fled to the Republic\nof South Africa following threats of arrest and unspecified harm by the Respondent State.\n42. The Complainant drew the Commission's attention to its decision on 215.983 , where the Commission\nheld that a Complainant's inability to pursue local remedies following his flight for fear of his life to Benin,\nand was subsequently granted asylum was sufficient to establish a standard for constructive exhaustion of\nlocal remedies. He concluded by noting that considering the fact that he was no longer in the Respondent\nState's ternary where remedies could be sought. And that he fled the country against his will due to threat\nto his life; remedies could not be pursued without impediments.\n43. The Complainant also challenged the effectiveness of the remedies noting that remedies are effective\nonly where they offer a prospect of success. He claimed the Respondent State's reaction to court rulings\nthat go against it is well documented by reputable international and African NGOs, noting that the\nRespondent State treats court rulings that go against it with indifference and disfavour, and that he does\nnot expect that in his case, any decision of the court would be adhered to. He said there was a tendency in\nthe Respondent State to ignore court rulings that went against it and added that the Zimbabwe Lawyers for\nHuman Rights had documented at least 12 instances where the State had ignored court rulings since 2000.\nHe cited the ruling of the High Court in the Commercial Farmers Union, the Mark Chavunduka and Ray\nChoto cases, where, in the latter case, the duo were allegedly abducted and tortured by the army. He\nconcluded that given the prevailing circumstances and the nature of his complaint and the Respondent\nState's well publicised practice of non-enforcement of court decisions, his case had no prospect of success\nif local remedies were pursued and according to him, not worth pursuing. Finally, the Complainant\nsubmitted that he could not have exhausted local remedies as any such exhaustion would have to comply\nwith the States Liabilities Act which prevents the Complainant from suing the Respondent State after the\nexpiration of two months of the date of the incident complained of, no prior notice has been given.\n44. The Complainant further submitted that the communication was submitted 22 months after the violation\nbecause he hoped that the situation in the country would improve to enable him utilise domestic remedies.\nHe said there is instead a deterioration of the situation and hope of improvement is highly unlikely in the\nnear future, adding that \"continuing to wait whilst the Complainant is undergoing tremendous psychological\ntorture and suffering attributable to his persecution will undoubted cause irreparable harm\". The\n4\n\n\fComplainant added that since he fled to South Africa he has been undergoing psycho-therapy and was not\nin a position to submit his communication to the Commission.\n45. The Complainant indicated other reasons that prevented him from submitting his complaint on time,\nincluding the fact that the judiciary abides by a code of conduct in terms of which they do not ordinarily\nspeak out and take positions against the establishment, noting that out of eight or so members who have\nleft Zimbabwe because of persecution, he is the only one who was speaking out. He added that he was\nafraid for the lives of members of his immediate family that were at risk of persecution because of him and\nthat he was unable to submit immediately for want of resources and facilities, noting that the submission\nwas made possible through the assistance and support of well wishers.\n46. Finally, Complainant further submitted that the communication had not been before any other\ninternational body for settlement as required by Article 56(7).\nRespondent State's submission on admissibility\n\n47. The Respondent State briefly restated the facts of the communication and indicated that it will attend to\nthe matters of fact, pertaining to the complaint \"in order to put the communication in proper perspective\".\nThe State submitted that the Complainant was appointed to the Office of Administrative Court President in\nterms of Section 79\n× 79 Judicial authority (1) The judicial authority of Zimbabwe shall vest in-- (a) the Supreme Court; and (b)\nthe High Court; and (c) such other courts subordinate to the Supreme Court and the High Court as may be\nestablished by or under an Act of Parliament. (2) The provisions of subsection (1) shall not be construed as\npreventing an Act of Parliament from-- (a) vesting adjudicating functions in a person or authority other than\na court referred to in subsection (1); or (b) vesting functions other than adjudicating functions in a court\nreferred to in subsection (1) or in a member of the judiciary. [Section as substituted by section 10 of Act 30\nof 1990 - Amendment No. 11] 79A Judiciary\nThe judiciary of Zimbabwe shall consist of-- (a) the Chief Justice, who shall be the head of the judiciary;\nand (b) the judges of the Supreme Court; and (c) the Judge President and the other judges of the High\nCourt; and\n(d) persons presiding over other courts subordinate to the Supreme Court and the High Court that are\nestablished by or under an Act of Parliament. [Section as inserted by section 10 of Act 30 of 1990 Amendment No. 11] 79B Independence of judiciary\nIn the exercise of his judicial authority, a member of the judiciary shall not be subject to the direction or\ncontrol of any person or authority, except to the extent that a written law may place him under the direction\nor control of another member of the judiciary. [Section as inserted by section 10 of Act 30 of 1990 Amendment No. 11]\nof the Constitution at Zimbabwe, read together with the Administrative Court Act. The State added that\nwhile performing his functions as a Magistrate, Presidents of the Administrative Court are not judges, noting\nthat in essence, the Complainant was not a judge.\n48. According to the State, the Complainant was supposed to be in a court in Bulawayo, but due to his poor\nhealth and his relationship with the Minister of Justice, he was appointed to the Administrative Court in\nHarare. The State noted that Complainant was a sick man throughout his whole duration at the court and\nadded that \"in fact from the time of his appointment as a Court President, the Complainant used to travel to\nSouth Africa to seek medical attention\".\n49. The State claims that Complainant applied for two weeks vacation from 9th to 31st December 2003 and\nwent to South Africa for medical attention. That he then tendered his resignation on 14th January 2004. The\nState observed that even though the letter has a Zimbabwean address, an examination of the delivery slip\nshowed that it had been dispatched from South Africa. The State concluded that the above circumstances\nwhich show how Complainant left the country do not amount to forced flight as he claims.\n50. The State questioned why Complainant would take steps to regularise his absence from office by\napplying for vacation leave and tender his resignation to the Minister who was threatening him. Without\nproducing any document title, the State added that it is apparent from the documents available that he was\nmaintaining dialogue with a government which he claims was persecuting him. The State observed further\nthat the letter of resignation even showed the address Complainant was residing and \"assuming the\ngovernment of Zimbabwe really wanted his life, it would have used the address he had volunteered to track\nhim\". The State concluded by stating that the truth is that [the] \"Complainant was never threatened by\n5\n\n\fanyone, anywhere both within and outside Zimbabwe\".\n51. On the admissibility of the communication, the State argued that the communication be declared\ninadmissible for non-compliance with the provisions of Articles 56(2), (5) and (6) of the Charter.\n52. The State argued that the communication is not compatible as required by Article 56(2) of the Charter,\nas it makes general allegations without substantiating, adding that, for a complaint to be compatible with\nthe Charter or the Constitutive Act, it must prove a prima facie violation of the Charter. According to the\nState, the facts raised in the communication do not raise any violation of the Charter, noting that \"basically\nthe facts and issues in dispute do not fall within the rationae personae of the jurisdiction of the\nCommission\".\n53. On the exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56(5), the State submitted that local remedies were\navailable to the Complainant, citing section 24\n× 24 Enforcement of protective provisions (1) If any person alleges that the Declaration of Rights has been,\nis being or is likely to be contravened in relation to him (or, in the case of a person who is detained, if any\nother person alleges such a contravention in relation to the detained person), then, without prejudice to any\nother action with respect to the same matter which is lawfully available, that person (or that other person)\nmay, subject to the provisions of subsection (3), apply to the Supreme Court for redress. [Subsection as\namended by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10] (2) If in any proceedings in the High Court or\nin any court subordinate to the High Court any question arises as to the contravention of the Declaration of\nRights, the person presiding in that court may, and if so requested by any party to the proceedings shall,\nrefer the question to the Supreme Court unless, in his opinion, the raising of the question is merely frivolous\nor vexatious. [Subsection as amended by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10] (3) Where in\nany proceedings such as are mentioned in subsection (2) any such question as is therein mentioned is not\nreferred to the Supreme Court, then, without prejudice to the right to raise that question on any appeal from\nthe determination of the court in those proceedings, no application for the determination of that question\nshall lie to the Supreme Court under subsection (1). [Subsection as amended by section 13 of Act 25 of\n1981 - Amendment No. 2] (4) The Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction-- (a) to hear and determine\nany application made by any person pursuant to subsection (1) or to determine without a hearing any such\napplication which, in its opinion, is merely frivolous or vexatious; and\nb) to determine any question arising in the case of any person which is referred to it pursuant to subsection\n(2);\nand may make such orders, issue such writs and give such directions as it may consider appropriate for the\npurpose of enforcing or securing the enforcement of the Declaration of Rights:\nProvided that the Supreme Court may decline to exercise its powers under this subsection if it is satisfied\nthat adequate means of redress for the contravention alleged are or have been available to the person\nconcerned under other provisions of this Constitution or under any other law. [Subsection as amended by\nsection 20 of Act 23 of 1987 - Amendment No. 7 and by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10]\n(5) If in any proceedings it is alleged that anything contained in or done under the authority of any law is in\ncontravention of section 16, 17, 19, 20, 21 or 22 and the court decides, as a result of hearing the parties,\nthat the complainant has shown that the court should not accept that the provision of the law concerned is\nreasonably justifiable in a democratic society on such of the grounds mentioned in section 16(7), 17(2),\n19(5), 20(2) and (4), 21(3) or 22(3)(a) to (e), as the case may be, as are relied upon by the other party\nwithout proof to its satisfaction, it shall issue a rule nisi calling upon the responsible Minister to show cause\nwhy that provision should not be declared to be in contravention of the section concerned.

[Subsection as amended by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10]\n(8) A written law may confer upon the Supreme Court powers additional to those conferred by this section\nfor the purpose of enabling the Supreme Court more effectively to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it\nby this section.

[Subsection as amended by section 13 of Act 25 of 1981 - Amendment No. 2]\nof the Constitution of Zimbabwe which provides the course of action to be taken where there is human\nrights violation. The State added that there is no evidence to prove that the Complainant pursued local\nremedies. The State further indicated that in terms of Zimbabwe law, where one is engaged in acts that\nviolate the rights of another person, that other person can obtain an interdict from the court restraining the\nviolator from such act.\n54. On the effectiveness of the remedies, the State submitted that the Constitution provides for the\nindependence of the judiciary in the exercise of its mandate in conformity with both the UN Principles on an\nIndependent Judiciary and the African Commission's Guidelines on the Right to Fair Trial.\n55. The State dismissed the Complainant's argument that his case is similar to those brought by Sir Dawda\nJawara / The Gambia and Rights International (on behalf of Charles Baridorn Wiwa) / Nigeria, adding that\nin the latter cases, there was proof of real threat to life, the State went further to indicate instances where\nthe government has implemented court decisions that went against it.\n56. The State further indicated that in terms of Zimbabwe law, it is not a legal requirement for a\nComplainant to be physically present in the country in order to access local remedies, adding that both the\nHigh Court Act and the Supreme Court Act permit any person to make an application to either court through\nhis/her lawyer. The State added that in the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka case, the victims were\ntortured by State agents and they applied for compensation while they were both in the United Kingdom\nand succeeded in their claim. The State concluded that the Complainant is not barred from pursuing\nremedies in a similar manner.\n57. The State further submitted that since his resignation, the government of Zimbabwe continues to pay\nthe Complainant his pension benefits and argued that the excuse raised by the Complainant of lack of\nresources to enable him submit his complaint on time is therefore without merit adding that he could have\ninstructed his counsel in Zimbabwe to attend to his claim on his behalf.\n58. According to the State, the Complainant sought to mislead the Commission by claiming that under the\nState Liabilities Act, claims against the State are prescribed within a period of sixty days. The State\nindicated that section 6 of the Act is clear that the sixty days is in respect of a notice of intention to sue. The\nAct prescribes that a summons against [the] State in certain matters must be delivered sixty days after the\nnotice of intention to sue, and according to the State, this would actually work well for the Complainant,\nadding that the period of proscription of claims is three years and Complainant's claim was not yet three\nyears and thus not prescribed.\n59. The State also submitted that the complaint does not conform to Article 56(6) of the Charter indicating\nthat the communication should be lodged within a reasonable time after exhaustion of local remedies, but\nwhere Complainant realises that local remedies shall be unduly prolonged, he/she must submit the\ncomplaint to the Commission immediately. According to the State, although the Charter does not specify\nwhat constitute a reasonable time, the Commission should get inspiration from the other jurisdictions,\nincluding the Inter-American Commission which has fixed six months as reasonable time, adding that even\nthe draft protocol merging the African Court of Justice and the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights\nprovides for six months.\n60. The State argued that the communication was submitted 22 months after the alleged violation, which\naccording to the State \"was filed well out of time\". On Complainant's submission that he had been seeking\npsycho therapy treatment, the State argued that [the] Complainant had been the centre of attraction in\nSouth Africa since 2004, demonising the Respondent State, adding that articles published by [the]\nComplainant in the South African press do not show someone with a psychological ailment. The State\nadded that no proof had been given of the alleged treatment or an expert diagnosis of how such condition\nwas acquired. On [the] Complainant's claim that he had no resources, the State argued that he had his\npension benefits which he could have used to submit his complaint to the Commission.\n61. The State concluded its submissions by noting that \"no cogent reasons have been given for the failure\nto pursue local remedies or remedies before the Commission within a reasonable time\", and as such the\ncommunication should be declared inadmissible.\n\n7\n\n\fCompetence of the African Commission\n\n62. In the present communication, the Respondent State raises a question regarding the competence of the\nAfrican Commission to deal with this communication. The State avers that: \"... basically the facts and\nissues in dispute do not fall within the rationae materae and rationae personae of the jurisdiction of the\nCommission\". This statement thus challenges the competence of the African Commission to deal with this\ncommunication. The Commission will thus, first deal with the preliminary issue of its competence raised by\nthe Respondent State.\n63. Black's Law Dictionary defines rationae materae as \"by reason of the matter involved; in consequence\nof, or from the nature of, the subject-matter\". While rationae personae is defined as \"By reason of the\nperson concerned; from the character of the person\".4\n64. Given the nature of the allegations contained in the communication, such as allegations of violation of\npersonal integrity or security, intimidation and torture, the Commission is of the view that the\ncommunication raises material elements which may constitute human rights violation, and as such, it has\ncompetence rationae materae to deal with the matter, because the communication alleges violations to\nhuman rights protected in the Charter. With regards to the Commission's competence rationae personae,\nthe communication indicates the name of the author, an individual, whose rights under the African Charter,\nthe Respondent State is committed to respecting and protecting. With regards to the State, the Commission\nnotes that Zimbabwe, the Respondent State in this case, has been a State Party to the African Charter\nsince 1986. Therefore, both the Complainant and the State have locus standi before the Commission, and\nthe Commission thus has competence rationae personae to examine the communication.\n65. Having decided that it has competence rationae materae and rationae personae, the African\nCommission will now proceed to pronounce on the admissibility requirements and the contentious areas\nbetween the parties.\nDecision of the African Commission on admissibility\n\n66. The admissibility of communications before the African Commission is determined by the requirements\nof Article 56 of the African Charter. This article provides seven requirements which must all be met before\nthe Commission can consider and declare a communication admissible. It one of the\nconditions/requirements is not met the Commission shall declare the Communication inadmissible, unless\nthe Complainant provides justifications why any of the requirements could not be met.\n67. ln the present communication, the Complainant avers that his complaint meets the requirements under\nArticles 56 (1) to (4), (6) and (7). He admits that he did not attempt to comply with the requirement provided\nunder Article 56.5 dealing with the exhaustion of local remedies, but added that given the nature of his\ncase, and the circumstances under which he left the Respondent State, and is living in South Africa, the\nexception rule under this sub-section of Articles 56, should be invoked.\n68. The State on the other hand argues that the Complainant thus not complied with the provisions of\nArticles 56(2), (5) and (6) of the Charter, and urges the Commission to declare the communication\ninadmissible, based on non-compliance with these requirements.\n69. The African Commission will thus examine each of the provisions under Article56 of the African Charter,\nwhether it is disputed of not, as the African Commission has a responsibility to ensure that every\nrequirement in Article 56 has been fulfilled before admitting a communication.\n70. The requirements under Article 56 of the Charter are meant to ensure that a communication is properly\nbrought before the Commission, and seek to sieve frivolous and vexatious communications before they\nreach the merits stage. Thus declaring a communication admissible does not mean the Slate Party\nconcerned has violated the provisions of the Charter. It simply means that the communication meets the\nrequirements necessary for it to be considered on the merits. As indicated earlier, for a communication to\nbe declared admissible, it must meet all the requirements under Article 56. Therefore, it a party contends\nthat another party has not complied with one of the requirements, the Commission must pronounce itself on\nthe contentious issues between the parties, as well as the non-contentious issues.\n71. Article 56(1) of the African Charter provides that communications will be admitted if they indicate their\nauthors, even if they request anonymity. In the present case the author of this communication is identified\nas Michael Majuru, he has also not requested that his identity be hidden. The respondent State has also\nbeen cleared identified as the Republic of Zimbabwe. Therefore the provision of Article 56(1) has been\nadequately complied with.\n\n8\n\n\f72. Article 56(2) of the African Charter provides that a communication must be compatible with the Charter\nof the OAU (now Constitutive Act of the African Union) or with the African Charter on Human and Peoples'\nRights In the present communication, the Respondent State argues that the communication does not\ncomply with this requirement. The State asserts in this regard that, for a complaint to be compatible with the\nCharter or the Constitutive Act, it must prove a prima facie violation of the Charter.\n73. Compatibility denotes 'in compliance' or 'in conformity with' or 'not contrary to' or 'against'.5 In the\npresent communication, the Complainant alleges among others, violations of his right to personal integrity\nand being subjected to intimidation, harassment and psychological torture lie alleges further that agents of\nthe intelligence service of the Respondent State constantly harassed him and prevented him from\nexercising his duties freely. These allegations do raise a prima facie violation of human rights. In particular,\nthe right to the security of the person or personal integrity and the fight to work under satisfactory condition\nas stipulated in the Charter. In the jurisprudence of this Commission, Complainants need not specify which\narticles of the Charter have been violated, or even which right is being invoked, so long as they have raised\nthe substance of the issue in question. That, in the view of the Commission, has been established in this\ncase. Based on the above, the African Commission is satisfied that the requirement of Article 56(2) of the\nAfrican Charter has been sufficiently compiled with.\n74. Article 56(3) of the Charter provides that a communication will be admitted if they are not written in\ndisparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned and its institutions or to the\nOrganisation of African Unity (now the African Union). In the present case, the communication sent by the\nComplainant, does not, in the view of the, African Commission, contain any disparaging or insulting\nlanguage, and as a result of this, the requirement of Article 56(3) has been fulfilled.\n75. Article 56(4) of the Charter provides that the communication must not be based exclusively on news\ndisseminated through the mass media. This communication was submitted by the Complainant himself and\ngives an account of his personal experience with the law enforcement agents of the Respondent State. As\na result of this, the requirement of Article 56(4) has also been met.\n76. Article 56(5) of the Charter provides that a communication will be admitted only after all local remedies\nhave been exhausted. The Respondent State contends that the Complainant has not brought his case\nbefore the courts of the State in compliance with this provision of the Charter. The State argues that there\nare sufficient and effective local remedies available to the Complainant in the State, and the Complainant\nhas not sought these remedies before bringing the present communication before the Commission. On the\nother hand, the Complainant argues that since he had to flee the country due to fear for his life, he could\nnot come back to the country to pursue these local remedies.\n77. The rationale for the exhaustion of local remedies is to ensure that before proceedings are brought\nbefore an international body, the State concerned must have the opportunity to remedy the matter through\nits own local judicial system. This prevents the international tribunal from acting as a court of first instance,\nrather than as a body of last resort.6\n78. Three major criteria could be deduced from the practice and Jurisprudence of the Commission in\ndetermining compliance with this requirement namely: the remedy must be available, effective and\nsufficient.\n79. ln 147.95-149.96, the Commission stated that \"a remedy is considered available if the petitioner can\npursue it without impediment: it is deemed effective if it offers a prospect of success, and it is found\nsufficient if it is capable or redressing the complaint\". In 147.95-149.96, which both parties have cited, the\nCommission held that \"the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in\npractice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. ... Therefore, if the applicant\ncannot turn the judiciary of his country because of fear for his life (or even those of his relatives), local\nremedies would be considered to be unavailable to him\".\n80. The Complainant in the present communication on claims that he left his country out of fear for his life\ndue to intimidation, harassment and undue influence in the exercise of his duties. The Complainant has\nalso alleged a history of non-compliance with the orders of the court of the Respondent, and alleges that a\nhuman rights NGO in Zimbabwe - the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, has documented 12 cases\nsince the year 2000, where the State has ignored court rulings that go against it. According to the\nComplainant, it is noteworthy that although local remedies may be available in the Respondent State, there\nis no assurance of its effectiveness or its implementation due to the fact that if the court rules in favour of\nthe Complainant, there is no guarantee that the ruling will be complied with by the State.\n81. The Complainant cited the African Commission's decisions in the Jawara case and the cases of\nAlhassan Abubakar v Ghana7 and Rights International v Nigeria8 in which he said the Commission found\n9\n\n\fthat the Complainants in these cases could not be expected to pursue domestic remedies in their country\ndue to the fact that they had fled their country and were in fact residing outside their country at the time the\ncommunications were brought before the Commission.\n82. Having studied the Complainant's submissions, and comparing it with the above cases cited in support\nof his claim, this Commission is of the opinion that the above cases cited by the Complainant are not similar\nto his case. In the Jawara case for example, the Complainant was a former Head of State who had been\noverthrown in a military coup. Mr Jawara alleged that after the coup, there was, \"blatant abuse of power\nby.... the military junta\". The military government was alleged to have initiated a reign of terror, intimidation\nand arbitrary detention. He further alleged the abolition of the Bill of Rights as contained in the 1970\nGambia Constitution by Military Decree No. 30/31, ousting the competence of the courts to examine or\nquestion the validity of any such Decree. The communication alleged the banning of political parties and of\nMinisters of the former civilian government from taking part in any political activity. The communication\nfurther alleged restrictions on freedom of expression, movement and religion. These restrictions were\nmanifested, according to the Complainant, by the arrest and detention of people without charge,\nkidnappings, torture and the burning of a mosque.\n83. In the 147.95-149.96 case, the Commission concluded that \"the Complainant in this case had been\noverthrown by the military, he was tried in absentia former Ministers and Members of Parliament of his\ngovernment have been detained and there was terror and fear for lives in the country. There is no doubt\nthat there, was a generalised fear perpetrated by the regime as alleged by the Complainant. This created\nan atmosphere not only in the mind of the author but also in the minds of right thinking people that returning\nto his country at that material moment, for whatever reason would be risky to his life. Under such\ncircumstances, domestic remedies cannot be said to have been available to the Complainant\". The\nCommission finally noted that, \"it would be an affront to common sense and logic to require the\nComplainant to return to his country to exhaust local remedies\".\n84. In the 103.93 case, it should be recalled that Mr Alhassan Abubakar was a Ghanaian citizen who was\narrested by the Ghanaian authorities in the 1980s for allegedly cooperating with political dissidents. He was\ndetained without charge or trial for over 7 years until his escape from a prison hospital on 19th February\n1992 to Côte d'lvoire. After his escape, his sister and wife who had been visiting him in Côte d'lvoire, were\narrested and held for two weeks in an attempt to get information on the Complainant's whereabouts. The\nComplainant's brother informed him that the police have been given false information about his return, and\nhave on several occasions surrounded his house, searched it, and subsequently searched for him in his\nmother's village.\n85. In the early part of 1993, the UNHCR in Côte d'lvoire informed the Complainant that they had received\na report on him from Ghana assuring that he was free to return without risk of being prosecuted for fleeing\nfrom prison. The report further stated that all those detained for political reasons had been released. [The]\nComplainant on the other hand maintained that there is a law in Ghana which subjects escapees to\npenalties from 6 months to 2 years imprisonment, regardless of whether the detention from which they\nescaped was lawful or not. On the basis of the above, the Commission held that \"considering the nature of\nthe complaint it would not be logical to ask the Complainant to go back to Ghana in order to seek a remedy\nfrom national legal authorities. Accordingly, the Commission does not consider that local remedies are\navailable for the Complainant\".\n86. In Rights International9 , the victim, a certain Mr Charles Baridorn Wiwa, a Nigerian student in Chicago\nwas arrested and tortured at a Nigerian Military Detention Camp in Gokana. It was alleged that Mr Wiwa\nwas arrested on 3rd January 1996 by unknown armed soldiers in the presence of his mother and other\nmembers of his family and remained in the said Military detention camp from 3rd to 9th January 1996. While\nin detention, Mr Wiwa was horsewhipped and placed in a cell with forty-five other detainees. When he was\nidentified as a relative of Mr Ken Saro −Wiwa he was subjected to various forms at torture. Enclosed in the\ncommunication was medical evidence of Mr Wiwa's physical torture. After 5 days in the detention camp in\nGokana, Mr Wiwa was transferred to the State Intelligence Bureau (SIB) in Port Harcourt. Mr Wiwa was\nheld from 9-11 January 1996, without access to a legal counsel or relatives, except for a five minutes\ndiscussion with his grandfather. On 11th January 1996, Mr Wiwa and 21 other Ogonis were brought before\nthe Magistrate Court 2 in Port-Harcourt, charged with unlawful assembly in violation of Section 70 of the\nCriminal Code Laws of Eastern Nigeria 1963. Mr Wiwa was granted bail, but while out on bail some\nun-known people believed to be government agents abducted him and threatened his life by forcing him\ninto a car in Port-Harcourt. On the advice of human rights lawyers, Mr Wiwa fled Nigeria on 18th March\n1996 to Cotonou Republic of Benin, where the UN High Commissioner for Refugees declared him a\n10\n\n\frefugee. On September 17th 1996, the US government granted him refugee status and he has been\nresiding in the United States since then.\n87. In this case, the African Commission declared the communication admissible on grounds that there was\nlack of available and effective domestic remedies for human rights violations in Nigeria under the military\nregime. It went further to assert that \"the standard for constructive exhaustion of domestic remedies is\nsatisfied where there is no adequate or effective remedy available to the individual. In this particular case,\nMr Wiwa was unable to pursue any domestic remedy following his flight for fear of his life to the Republic of\nBenin and the subsequent granting of refugee status to him by the United States of America\".\n88. The present communication brought by Mr Michael Majuru should also be differentiated from Gabriel\nShumba v Republic of Zimbabwe10 . In the Shumba case, the Complainant alleged that, he, in the\npresence of 3 others, namely Bishop Shumba, Taurai Magayi and Charles Mutama was taking instructions\nfrom one of his clients, a Mr John Sikhala, in a matter involving alleged political harassment by members of\nthe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP). Mr John Sikhala is a Member of Parliament from the Movement for\nDemocratic Change (MDC), which is an opposition party in Zimbabwe. At about 11:00 pm riot police\naccompanied by plain-clothes policemen and personnel identified to be from the Central Intelligence\nOrganisation (CIO) stormed the room and arrested everyone present. During the arrest, the Complainant's\nlaw practising certificate, diary, files, documents and cell phone were confiscated and he was slapped and\nkicked several times by, among others, the Officer in Charge of Saint Mary's Police Station.\n89. The Complainant and the others were taken to Saint Mary's Police Station where he was detained\nwithout charge and denied access to legal representation. He was also denied food and water. The\nComplainant claimed that on the next day following his arrest he was removed from the cell, a hood was\nplaced over his head and he was driven to an unknown location where he was led down what seemed like\na tunnel to a room underground. The hood was removed, he was stripped naked and his hands and feet\nwere bound in a foetal position and a plank was thrust between his legs and arms. While in this position,\nthe Complainant was questioned and threatened with death by about 15 interrogators. The Complainant\nfurther alleged that he was also electrocuted intermittently for 8 hours and a chemical substance was\napplied to his body. He lost control of his bodily functions, vomited blood and he was forced to drink his\nvomit. The Complainant submitted a certified copy of the medical report describing the injuries found on his\nbody. Following his interrogation, at around 7pm of the same day, the Complainant was unbound and\nforced to write several statements implicating him and several senior MDC members in subversive\nactivities. At around 7:30pm he was taken to Harare Police Station and booked into a cell. On the third day\nof his arrest, his lawyers who had obtained a High Court injunction ordering his release to court were\nallowed to access him. The Complainant was subsequently charged under section 5 of the Public Order\nand Security Act that relates to organising, planning or conspiring to overthrow the government through\nunconstitutional means. He then fled Zimbabwe for fear of his life.\n90. In the above cases, there is one thing in common - the clear establishments of the element of fear\nperpetrated by identified state institutions fear which in the 147.95-149.96 case, the Commission observed\nthat \"it would be reversing the clock of justice to request me complainant to attempt local remedies\".\n91. In the communication under consideration however, Mr Michael Majuru alleges that he fled the country\nfor fear of his life, that he was intimidated and harassed by the Minister of Justice and by suspected state\nagents. He also indicated that he received \"a telephone call from a sympathetic member of the legal\nfraternity and the police that the Respondent State was fabricating a case against him and that he was to\nbe arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for defying the Respondent's orders\".\n92. In this communication, it is clear that the Complainant has simply made general accusations and has\nnot corroborated his allegations with documentary evidence, sworn affidavits or testimonies of others. He\nclaims the Minister sent an Instruction through a colleague of his but there is no way of ascertaining this\nfact. The applicant was the President of the Administrative Court, and has not show how the instruction\npurportedly sent by the Minister through the Complainant's colleague, who the Commission is not told the\nkind of influence he had over the Complainant, could have or did intimidate him. Apart from the direct\ntelephone call the Complainant claims he received from the Minister on 23rd October and 24th November\n2003, all the alleged threats intimidations and harassment he claims, were perpetrated by persons he\nsuspects were government agents. Most of his allegations are unsubstantiated. For example, he indicated\nin paragraph 2.5.4.7 of his submissions that \"the Minister expressed his displeasure with the said decision\nand further attempted to unduly influence and/or threaten the Complainant\". He fails to show how this\nattempted influence or threat by the Minister was carried out.\n\n11\n\n\f93. It is further observed by the Commission that the alleged threat or pressure claimed by the Complainant\nto have been meted by Enoch Kamushinda, who the complainant himself refers to as a suspected Central\nIntelligence Organisation (CIO) operative, has not been substantiated: neither has the purported pressure\nand entrapment alleged to have been made by Mr Ben Chisvo who according to the Complainant, is a\nsuspected CIO informer. Furthermore, the Complainant alleged he received a telephone call from a\nsympathetic member of the legal fraternity and the police that the Respondent State was fabricating a case\nagainst him, and that he was to be arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for\ndefying the Respondent's orders. All the above allegations are not substantiated take the latter for example,\nwhat if the \"sympathetic member of the legal fraternity\" was a hoax? What if he was acting on his own or\nwanted to benefit from the misfortune of the Complainant? His or her name is not even known.\n94. It is not possible for the Commission to determine the level of intimidation or harassment that is needed\nto instil fear in a person to force that person to flee for their life. However, in the instant case, there is no\nconcrete evidence to link the Complainant's fear to the Respondent State.\n95. It is therefore the opinion of the Commission that the Complainant has not sufficiently demonstrated\nthat his life or those of his close relatives were threatened by the Respondent State, forcing him to flee the\ncountry, and as such, cannot hold that the Complainant left the country due to threats and intimidation from\nthe State.\n96. However, the question is, having left the country, could the Complainant still have exhausted local\nremedies or better still is he required to exhaust local remedies?\n97. The first test that a local remedy must pass is that it must be available to be exhausted. The word\n\"available\" means \"readily obtainable\", [/quote]\"accessible\"[/quote]11 ; or \"attainable, reachable on call, on\nhand ready, present; ... convenient, at one's service, at one's command, at one's disposal, at one's beck\nand call\"12 . According to the African Commission, a remedy is considered to be available if the petitioner\ncan pursue it without impediments or if he can make use of it in the circumstances of his case.13 In the\npresent communication, the question to be asked is whether there were remedies available to the\nComplainant even from outside the Respondent State?\n98. The State indicates that in terms of its laws, a Complainant need not be physically present in the\ncountry in order to access local remedies, adding that both the High Court Act and the Supreme Court Act\npermit any person to make an application to either court through his/her lawyer. In support of this, the State\ncited the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka case where the victims were tortured by state agents and they\napplied for compensation while they were both in the United Kingdom and succeeded in their claim. The\nState concluded that the Complainant is not barred from pursuing remedies in a similar manner. The State\nfurther argues that since his resignation, the government of Zimbabwe continues to pay the Complainant\nhis pension benefits which he could have used to instruct his counsel in Zimbabwe to attend to his claim on\nhis behalf.\n99. The Complainant does not dispute the availability of local remedies in the Respondent State, but\nargues that in his particular case, having fled the country for fear of his life, and now out of the country,\nlocal remedies are not available to him.\n100. The African Commission holds the view that having failed to establish that he left the country\ninvoluntarily, and the view of the fact that in Zimbabwe law, one need not be physically in the country to\naccess local remedies; the Complainant cannot claim that local remedies were not available to him.\n101. The Complainant argues that even if local remedies were available, they were not effective because\nthe State has the tendency of ignoring court rulings taken against it, citing among others, the High Court\ndecision in the Commercial Farmers Union and the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka cases, and added\nthat the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights has documented at least 12 instances where the state has\nignored court rulings since 2000.\n102. The Rules of Procedure of the African Commission provide that \"the Commission shall determine\nquestions of admissibility pursuant to Article 56 of the Charter\"14 . Generally the rules require applicants to\nset out in their submissions the steps taken to exhaust domestic remedies. They must provide some prima\nfacie evidence of an attempt to exhaust local remedies. The Human Rights Committee has stated that the\nmere fact that a domestic remedy is inconvenient or unattractive, or does not produce a result favourable to\nthe petitioner does not, in itself, demonstrate the lack of exhaustion of all effective remedies.15 In the\nCommittee's decision on A v Australia16 , it held that [quote]\"mere doubts about the effectiveness of local\nremedies or prospect of financial costs involved did not absolve the author from pursuing such remedies\"17\n. In Article 19 v Eritrea, the Commission held that \"it is incumbent on the Complainant to take all necessary\nsteps to exhaust, or at least attempt the exhaustion of local remedies. It is not enough for the Complainant\n12\n\n\fto cast aspersion on the ability of the domestic remedies of the State due to isolated incidences\". The\nEuropean Court of Human Rights on its part has held that even if the applicants have reason to believe that\navailable domestic remedies and possible appeals will be ineffective, they should seek those remedies\nsince \"it is generally incumbent on an aggrieved individual to allow the domestic courts the opportunity to\ndevelop existing rights by way of interpretation\".18\n103. From the above analysis, this Commission is of the view that the Complainant ignored to utilise the\ndomestic remedies available to him in the Respondent State, which had he attempted, might have yielded\nsome satisfactory resolution of the complaint.\n104. Article 56(6) of the Charter provides that \"Communications received by the Commission will be\nconsidered if they are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted, or\nfrom the date the Commission is seized with the matter ...\" The Respondent State contends that the\npresent communication on was not submitted on time by the Complainant, as required by the African\nCharter.\n105. The present communication was received at the Secretariat of the Commission on 8th November 2005\n(even though dated 2nd November 2005). It was considered for seizure by the Commission in November\n2005, that is, two years after the Complainant allegedly fled from the country. The Complainant never\napproached the courts of the Respondent State. He left the country in December 2003 and only seized the\nCommission twenty two months later. The Complainant submits without substantiating that he had been\nundergoing psychotherapy while in South Africa, and also indicated that he did not have the financial\nmeans to bring the case before the Commission. He also stated that he had hoped the situation in the\ncountry would improve to enable him utilise domestic remedies but there was instead a deterioration.\n106. The Commission notes that the Complainant is not residing in the Respondent State and notes further\nthat the Complainant indicated that he was prevented from submitting his complaint on time, because the\njudiciary abides by a code of conduct in terms of which they do not ordinarily speak out and take positions\nagainst the establishment, noting that out of eight or so members who have left Zimbabwe because of\npersecution, he is the only one who was speaking out. He added that he was afraid for the lives of\nmembers of his immediate family that were at risk of persecution because of him.\n107. The State on its part argues that \"no cogent reasons have been given for the failure to pursue local\nremedies or remedies before the Commission within reasonable time\". The State submits that the\ncommunication was submitted 22 months after the alleged violation, which according to the State \"was filed\nwell out of time\". On Complainant's submission that he had been seeking psycho-therapy treatment, the\nState argued that Complainant had been the centre of attraction in South Africa since 2004 demonising the\nRespondent State adding that articles published by the Complainant do not show someone with a\npsychological aliment. The State added that no proof had been given of the alleged treatment or an expert\ndiagnosis of having such condition was acquired. On Complainant's claim that he had no resources, the\nState argued that he had his pension benefits which he could have used to submit his complaint to the\nCommission.\n108. The Charter does not provide for what constitutes \"reasonable period\". However, the Commission has\nthe mandate to interpret the provisions of the Charter19 and in doing so; it takes cognizance of its duty to\nprotect human and peoples' rights as stipulated in the Charter. The provisions of other international\nregional instruments like the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the\nInter-American Convention on Human Rights, are almost similar and state that they > 20 , after this period\nhas elapsed the Court/Commission will no longer entertain the communication.\n109. The Commission is urged in Articles 60 and 61 of the Charter to consider as subsidiary measures to\ndetermine the applicable principles of law \"other general or special international instruments, laying down\nrules expressly recognised by member states of the African Union.\" Going by the practice of similar\nregional human rights instruments, such as the inter-American Commission and Court and the European\nCourt, six months seem to be the usual standard. This not withstanding, each case must be treated on its\nown merit. Where there is good and compelling reason why a Complainant could not submit his/her\ncomplaint for consideration on time, the Commission may examine the complaint to ensure fairness and\njustice.\n110. In the present communication, the arguments advanced by the Complainant as impediments for his\nlate submission of the complaint do not appear convincing. The complainant does not supply the\nCommission with medical proof to indicate he was suffering from mental problems, he does not indicate\nwhat gave him the impression that things might improve in Zimbabwe, alter he himself noted in his\ncomplaint that since 2000 there has been documented evidence to show that things were deteriorating,\n13\n\n\fincluding the fact that the government does not respect court judgments. Even if the Commission accepts\nthat he fled the country and needed time to settle, or that he was concerned for the safely of his relatives,\ntwenty two (22) months after fleeing the country is clearly beyond a reasonable man's understanding of\nreasonable period of time. The African Commission thus holds that the submission of the communication\nwas unduly delayed and thus does not comply with the requirements under Article 56(6) of the Charter.\n111. Article 56(7) of the African Charter provides that the communication must not deal with cases which\nhave been settled by the States, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations, or the Charter of\nthe OAU or the African Charter. In the present case, this case has not been settled by any of these\ninternational bodies, and as a result of this, the requirement of Article 56(7) has been fulfilled by the\nComplainant.\n\nHolding\n\nThe African Commission finds that in the present communication, that is, Communication 308/05 - Michael\nMajuru/Zimbabwe, the Complainant has not complied with sub-sections (5) and (6) of Article 56 of the\nAfrican Charter, and thus declares the communication inadmissible.\nAdopted at the 44th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights,\n10th - 24th November 2008, Abuja, Nigeria.\n\nFootnotes\n1 Communication 71/92.\n2 Communication 147/95 and 149/96.\n3 Communication 215/98.\n4 H C Black, JN Nolan-Haley & J R Nolan, Black's Law Dictionary (6 Ed.) 1990, 1262-1263.

The complaint is submitted by INTERIGHTS, Anton Katz and Max du Plessis (Complainants) on behalf\nof Mr Kenneth Good (victim), against the Republic of Botswana (Respondent State).\n2. The complaint states that Mr Kenneth Good, an Australian national, teaching at the University of\nBotswana, had his employment terminated after his expulsion from Botswana on 31st May 2005.\n3. It is submitted that in February 2005, in his capacity as Professor of Political Studies at the University of\nBotswana, the victim co-authored an article concerning presidential succession in Botswana. The article\ncriticised the Government, and concluded that Botswana is a poor example of African presidential\nsuccession.\n4. The Complainants submit that, on 18th February 2005, the President of Botswana, exercising the powers\nvested in him by section 7(f) of the Botswana Immigration Act, decided to declare the victim an undesirable\ninhabitant of, or visitor to, Botswana. The victim was not given reasons for this decision, nor was he given\nany opportunity to contest it.\n5. On 7th March 2005, the victim launched a constitutional challenge in the Botswana High Court. On 31st\nMay 2005, the High Court dismissed the application ruling that Section 7 (f) of the Botswana Immigration\nAct relates to what the President considers to be in the best interest of Botswana, and Sections 11(6) and\n36 of the same Act make the President's declaration unassailable on the merits.\n6. On 31st May 2005, the victim was deported from Botswana to South Africa.\n7. On 7th June 2005, the victim filed a notice and grounds of appeal in the Court of Appeal of the Republic\nof Botswana. On 27th July 2005, the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment dismissing the victim's appeal.\nThe Court of Appeal held that the President, in making such declarations, is empowered to act in what he\nconsiders to be the best interest of the country, without judicial oversight.\n8. The Complainants submit that the Court of Appeal is the highest judicial authority in Botswana. No\nfurther right of appeal or challenge lies from the decision of this court.\n\nComplaint\n9. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has violated Articles 1, 2, 7 (1) (a), 9, 12 (4), and 18\nof the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.\n\nProcedure\n10. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 24th November 2005.\n11. During the 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2006, the African\nCommission was seized of the communication.\n12. On 15th December 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties accordingly\nand requested them to submit arguments on admissibility. The Secretariat of the African Commission\nforwarded a copy of the complaint to the Respondent State.\n13. On 13th March 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received written submissions on\nadmissibility from the Complainants.\n14. By Note Verbale dated 5th April 2006, the Secretariat forwarded a copy of the Complainants'\nsubmission on admissibility to the Respondent State and reminded the latter to submit its arguments on the\nsame.\n15. On 18th April 2006, the Secretariat received an e-mail from one of the lawyers of the alleged victim\nrequesting to be invited to make oral submission at the 39th Ordinary Session.\n16. On 6th May 2006, the Secretariat received the submission on admissibility from the Respondent State.\n17. On 10th May 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a letter from the Centre for\nHuman Rights of the University of Pretoria submitting an amicus curiae brief.\n18. On 20th May 2006, the Secretariat received further submission on admissibility from the Respondent\nState.\n19. At its 39th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the communication and decided to\ndefer it to its 40th Ordinary Session.\n1\n\n\f20. By Note Verbale and by letter dated 14th July 2006, the Secretariat notified both parties of the decision\nof the Commission and informed them that they can make further submission on admissibility if they so\nwished.\n21. On 3rd October 2006, the Secretariat received a fax from the Complainants forwarding a copy of a letter\nof appeal addressed by the victim to the President of the Republic of Botswana, and the response of the\nSenior Private Secretary to the President.\n22. On 4th October 2006, the Secretariat received the Complainants' response to the Respondent State's\nfurther submission on admissibility.\n23. On 7th November 2006, the Secretariat received a letter from the Respondent State requesting the\nCommission to purge the Complainants' additional submissions from the record because the State was not\ninvited to make additional submission.\n24. At its 40th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 15th to 29th November 2006, both parties\nwere given audience before the Commission and the State requested to receive copy of the letter sent to\nthe Complainants inviting further arguments, and to be given time to respond to the additional submissions\nmade by the Complainants.\n25. The Commission decided to defer consideration of the communication to its 41st Ordinary Session and\ninstructed the Secretariat to forward a copy of the above letter to the Respondent State.\n26. By Note Verbale dated 12th February 2007, the Secretariat forwarded the above letter to the\nRespondent State and requested the latter to submit its observation on the same.\n27. On 25th April 2007, the Secretariat received the response of the Respondent State on the\nComplainants' further submissions.\n28. By Note Verbale dated 30th April 2007, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Respondent State's\nresponse.\n29. At its 41st Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the communication and decided to\ndeclare it admissible.\n30. By Note Verbale of 20th June 2007 and letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the\nCommission's decision.\n31. On 2nd October 2007 and 10th October 2007, the Secretariat received the Complainants' and\nRespondent State's submissions on the merits, respectively.\n32. By Note Verbale of 22nd October 2007 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat acknowledged\nreceipt of the Complainants' and Respondent State's submissions on the merits and forwarded each other's\nsubmission to the other party.\n33. At the 42nd Ordinary Session the Secretariat received the Complainants' response to the Respondent\nState's submissions on the merits.\n34. During the same 42nd Ordinary Session, the Respondent State raised a preliminary objection on the\nprocedure of the Commission and the Commission decided to defer the communication to allow the\nSecretariat prepare a decision on the preliminary objection.\n35. By Note Verbale of 19th December 2007 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat informed both\nparties of the Commission's decision.\n36. At its 44th Ordinary Session, the Commission dismissed the Respondent State's preliminary objections\nand requested that both parties submit within three months, their responses to the submissions of the other\nparty.\n37. By Note Verbale of 5th January 2009 and letter of the same date, both parties were informed of the\nCommission's decision and requested to make further submissions on the merits within three months.\n38. On 3rd February 2009, the Respondent State requested for a month extension of time to make further\nsubmissions on the merits.\n39. By Note Verbale of 9th February 2009, the Secretariat granted the extension of time requested by the\nRespondent State.\n40. By letter of 10th February 2009, the Complainant was informed of the extension of time granted to the\nRespondent State.\n41. By a Note Verbale dated 27th March 2009, the Secretariat invited the Respondent State to forward its\nfurther submissions on the merits.\n42. On 7th November 2009, the Respondent State made a complaint regarding the procedures followed by\nthe Secretariat in inviting the parties to make further submissions on the merits.\n43. On 8th April 2009, the Respondent State made further submissions objecting against the Commission's\napproach and application of the procedure laid down in Rule 119(2) [and] (3) of [its] Rules [of] Procedure\n2\n\n\fand requested the Commission to review its ruling.\n44. By Note Verbale dated 14th April 2009, the Secretariat notified the Respondent State of the\nCommission's decision to take a decision on the merits during its 45th Ordinary Session and further invited\nthe State to make its submissions no later than 30th April 2009.\n45. By a Note Verbale of 16th April 2009, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State that the latter's\nconcerns and issues will be tabled before the Commission during its 45th Ordinary Session.\n46. By a letter and Note Verbale of 7th December 2009, the Complainants and Respondent State were\ninformed of the Commission's decision to defer consideration of the communication to its 47th Ordinary\nSession.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\nComplainants' submission\n\n47. The Complainants submit that the requirements set in Article 56 of the African Charter have been\nsatisfied, as the author of the communication has been identified and relevant details of the Communication\nhave been provided to the Commission, including details of those individuals and organisations\nrepresenting the victim. According to the Complainants, the communication is compatible with the\nConstitutive Act of the African Union and with the African Charter. The communication is presented in a\npolite and respectful language, and is based on information provided by the victim and on court documents,\nnot on media reports. The Complainants state that the present communication has not been submitted to\nany other international human rights body for investigation or settlement.\n48. The Complainants claim that on 7th March 2005, the victim launched an application challenging the\nconstitutionality of the Botswana Immigration Act. The application, which challenged the President's\ndecision to expel him from Botswana, was dismissed by the High Court of Botswana in a unanimous\njudgment. They submit that the High Court in its judgment found that the President's declaration under\nSection 7(f) of the Immigration Act relates to what the President considers to be in the best interests of\nBotswana and Sections 11(6) and 36 of the same Act make the President's declaration unassailable on the\nmerits.\n49. The Complainants submit further that on 7th June 2005, the victim filed a notice and grounds of appeal\nto the Court of Appeal, in which he sought an order setting aside both the judgment appealed against and\nthe decision of the President of 18th February 2005. On 27th July 2005, the Court of Appeal delivered a\njudgment dismissing the victim's appeal. The Court of Appeal held that the President in making such\ndeclarations is empowered to act in what he considers to be the best interests of the country, without\njudicial oversight and that the Parliament which decreed that the President's decisions are not subject to\ndisclosure did not act ultra vires in doing so.\n50. The Complainants aver that both Courts found that the President, in making his declaration that the\nvictim was an \"undesirable inhabitant or visitor to Botswana\", is empowered to act in what he considers to\nbe the best interests of the country, without judicial oversight. The Courts ruled that in terms of the Act, the\nPresident's decisions are not subject to disclosure or challenge in a court of law and he did not act ultra\nvires.\n51. The Complainants submit that the Court of Appeal is the highest judicial authority in Botswana and no\nfurther right of appeal or challenge lies from the decision of this Court.\n52. As a result of the above, the Complainants argue that all domestic remedies available in the\nRespondent State have been exhausted for the purpose of Article 56(5). They also submit that the\ncommunication is brought before the Commission within three months of having exhausted such domestic\nremedies, pursuant to Article 56(6).\nRespondent State's Submissions\n\n53. In its submissions, the Respondent State challenges the Commission's existence and its competence\nto hear the case. Regarding the existence of the Commission, the Respondent State submits that the\nCommission was established within the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and that the OAU ceased to\nexist in July 2001, and no provision was made for the continuance of the work of the Commission in the\n3\n\n\fConstitutive Act of the African Union (AU) that took over from the OAU.\n54. The State further submits that Article 5\n× Article 5 Organs of the Union\n1. The organs of the Union shall be: (a) The Assembly of the Union; (b) The Executive Council; (c) The\nPan-African Parliament; (d) The Court of Justice; (e) The Commission; (f) The Permanent Representatives\nCommittee; (g) The Specialised Technical Committees; (h) The Economic, Social and Cultural Council; (i)\nThe Financial Institutions;\n2. Other organs that the Assembly may decide to establish.\nof the Constitutive Act, which lists the AU Organs, does not mention the African Commission, and that the\nAU did not make use of the capacity vested in it under Article 9(1) (d)\n× The functions of the Assembly shall be to:...d. Establish any organ of the Union;\nof the Constitutive Act to establish any other organ to bring the Commission back to existence. The\nRespondent State therefore concludes that the Commission has ceased to exist along with the OAU.\n55. However, the Respondent State does not challenge the existence of the African Charter, which it\nconsiders a \"mere instrument of noble ideals which unfortunately is devoid of any operational structures...\".\n56. With respect to the Commission's competence rationae materae (subject matter of the communication),\nthe Respondent State holds that the communication concerns immigration matters which are not part of the\nmandate of the Commission spelled out in Article 45 of the Charter. The State submits further that in terms\nof [popup=Article 13] Functions of the Executive Council\n1. The Executive Council shall coordinate and take decisions on policies in areas of common interest to the\nMember States, including the following:\n\n1. foreign trade;\n2. energy, industry and mineral resources;\n3. food, agricultural and animal resources, livestock production and forestry;\n4. water resources and irrigation;\n5. environmental protection, humanitarian action and disaster response and relief;\n6. transport and communications;\n7. insurance;\n8. education, culture, health and human resources development;\n9. science and technology;\n10. nationality, residency and immigration matters;\n11. social security, including the formulation of mother and child care policies, as well as policies\nrelating to the disabled and the handicapped;\n12. establishment of a system of African awards, medals and prizes.\n2. The Executive Council shall be responsible to the Assembly. It shall consider issues referred to it and\nmonitor the implementation of policies formulated by the Assembly.\n3. The Executive Council may delegate any of its powers and functions mentioned in paragraph 1 of this\nArticle to the Specialised Technical Committees established under Article 14 of this Act.[/popup] of the\nConstitutive Act, it is the Executive Council which is responsible for immigration matters.\n57. The Respondent State argues that in case the Commission finds itself to be in existence and to have\njurisdiction over the matter, the communication should notwithstanding be declared inadmissible for\nnon-compliance with Article 56 of the African Charter.\n58. It is the State's view that the communication is not compatible with the African Charter. It submits that\nnot all the elements of the communication have been disclosed to the State, placing the latter \"in an\nuntenable position where it does not know the exact nature of the Complaint against it,\" and that therefore\nthe communication is irregular and/or non-compliant with Rule 104(e) as read with Article 56(2) of the\nAfrican Charter.\n59. The Respondent State also states that Article 23(1) of the African Charter recognises peoples' rights to\nnational and international peace and security, and that Article 12(2) allows States Parties to restrict the right\nto freedom of movement by means of law for the \"protection of national security, law and order...\". The\n4\n\n\fState holds that the interpretation of these provisions is that \"States must be left alone and allowed to deal\nwith matters of peace and national security\". The Respondent State submits that the matter before the\nCommission involves national security and that the Commission has no competence over it.\n60. The Respondent State further submits that the decision to expel the victim was taken by the President\nin accordance with the law as required under Article 12(4) of the African Charter.\n61. The Respondent State argues that the victim's expulsion was confirmed by the courts and that the\nState has the obligation under Article 26 of the Charter to guarantee the independence of the judiciary and\ncannot interfere with their rulings.\n62. The Respondent State also states that the victim's appeal to courts in Botswana was dismissed with\ncosts, which he has not yet paid, and that by instituting proceedings before the Commission he is just trying\nto escape his obligation in Botswana. The State concludes that the communication is frivolous and\nvexatious, and that it should be rejected and held inadmissible.\n63. The Respondent State further submits that the victim did not avail himself of the possibility offered to\nhim to resort to the President to review the decision expelling him. It is therefore the State's submission that\nlocal remedies have not been exhausted.\n64. For all the aforementioned reasons, the Respondent State prays the Commission to declare the\ncommunication inadmissible.\nResponse of the Complainants to the Respondent State's submission on admissibility\n\n65. The Complainants submit that the fact that the OAU ceased to exist does not affect the existence of the\nCommission, and that the latter continues to exist de facto and de jure. De facto, the work of the\nCommission was not hindered or suspended as a result of the coming into force of the AU Constitutive Act:\nit continued considering communications; holding sessions; undertaking visits to State Parties, including the\nRespondent State, which continues to collaborate with it. De jure, the AU Assembly, by its decision, ruled\nthat the Commission \"shall henceforth operate within the framework of the African Union\".\n66. The Complainants argue that the African Charter established the Commission and the fact that the\nAfrican Charter is still in force, as the Respondent State did acknowledge, is tantamount to recognising the\nexistence of the African Commission.\n67. With respect to the disclosure of documents to the State, the Complainants argue that the\ncommunication is not based on media reports but on the information provided by the victim and on court\ndocuments, and that only two judgments have been enclosed because they are the only ones relevant at\nthe particular stage of the proceedings and from the point of view of exhaustion of domestic remedies.\n68. The Complainants also challenge the argument of the Respondent State that the Commission does not\nhave jurisdiction over immigration matters. They submit that that Article 45(2) mandates the Commission to\nprotect human rights generally, without leaving out the rights of immigrants or people facing deportation,\nnoting that Article 12 of the Charter makes clear reference to migration.\n69. The Complainants finally submit that the other points of the State's submission relate to the merits and\nshould not be considered at this stage of the procedure, adding that the communication meets all the\nadmissibility requirements and should be declared admissible.\nRespondent State's reaction to the Complainant's response to its submissions\n\n70. In an oral submission during the 40th Ordinary Session of the Commission, and by letter dated 22nd\nMarch 2007, the Respondent State submitted that the additional submission on admissibility by the\nComplainants should be purged from the record of proceedings because the invitation to make additional\nsubmission was a misuse of the procedure under Rule 119 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure. It is\nthe Respondent State's view that no reason was given for inviting the Complainants to submit and that the\nletter was signed by a Finance and Administration Officer (FAO), who is not a member of the Commission,\nand in inviting the Complainants to submit, the FAO unlawfully participated in the deliberations or decisions\nof the Commission.\n71. The Respondent State goes on to reiterate its statement that the Commission is an emanation of the\nCharter, which established it to work within the OAU. The dissolution of the OAU, the State submits,\ndeprived the Commission of the legitimacy and authority as mechanism for the settling of disputes.\nAccording to the Respondent State, in the absence of an amendment to Article 30 of the African Charter to\nenable the Commission to operate within the AU, and without an AU decision integrating the Commission\nas an organ of the AU, the African Commission lacks legal basis to continue performing its mandate under\n5\n\n\fthe African Charter.\nDecision of the Commission on the Respondent State's challenge of its existence and competence\n\n72. Considering that the Respondent State contests the existence of the African Commission and its\njurisdiction to hear the matter complained of, the Commission will deal with those two points before dealing\nwith the admissibility of the communication.\n73. Regarding the existence of the Commission, the Respondent State submits that the Commission was\nestablished within the OAU, and that the OAU ceased to exist in July 2001 and no provision was made for\nthe continuance of the work of the Commission in the Constitutive Act of the African Union that took over\nfrom the OAU.\n74. According to the Respondent State, Article 5\n× 1. The organs of the Union shall be:\n1. The Assembly of the Union;\n2. The Executive Council;\n3. The Pan-African Parliament;\n4. The Court of Justice;\n5. The Commission;\n6. The Permanent Representatives Committee;\n7. The Specialised Technical Committees;\n8. The Economic, Social and Cultural Council;\n9. The Financial Institutions;\n\n2. Other organs that the Assembly may decide to establish.\nof the Constitutive Act, which lists the AU Organs, does not mention the African Commission, and the AU\ndid not make use of the capacity vested in it under Article 9(1)(d)\n× 1. The functions of the Assembly shall be to: (d) establish any organ of the Union\nof the Constitutive Act to establish any other organ to bring the Commission back to existence. The\nRespondent State therefore concludes that the Commission has ceased to exist along with the OAU.\n75. In terms of Article 30 of the African Charter, \"An African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, ...\nshall be established within the Organisation of African Unity to promote human and peoples' rights and\nensure their protection in Africa\". It is the Commission's view that having been established by the African\nCharter, the termination of a treaty other than the Charter cannot affect its existence.\n76. The Commission would like to emphasise that although it was established by the African Charter and\nnot a direct emanation of the OAU Charter, it was operating within the framework of the OAU, the latter\nbeing the main political organisation on the continent. As an organisation working within the framework of\nthe OAU, the Commission relied on the OAU for its funding and its staffing,1 and for the execution of its\ndecisions against Members States found to be in violation of the Charter2 . With the coming into force of the\nConstitutive Act, all the \"assets and liabilities\" of the OAU \"... and all matters relating thereto'' including\nrelevant institutions established within the OAU, were devolved to the AU3 . That is why, the Heads of State\nand Government of the AU, at their first Ordinary Session held in Durban, South Africa, from 8th to 10th July\n2002, accepted to take over the obligations the OAU used to bear vis-?-vis the African Commission. In its\ndecision on the Interim Period, the Assembly of the African Union decided that \"the African Commission on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights and the African Committee of Experts on Rights and Welfare of the Child shall\nhenceforth operate within the framework of the African Union\"4 .\n77. As a matter of fact, the AU assumed towards the Commission the same obligations as previously borne\nby the OAU. The AU appoints the 11 Members of the Commission, provides staff to the Secretariat, funds\nthe day-to-day work of the Commission, and adopts the reports submitted by the Commission. Moreover,\nMember States of the AU (which are also State Parties to the African Charter), including the Respondent\nState, continue to cooperate with the African Commission, by submitting their reports under Article 62 of the\nCharter, by hosting sessions and missions of the Commission, and by actively participating in the\ncommunication procedures when complaints are brought against them before the Commission.\n78. The Commission takes note of the fact that, although it challenges the existence of the Commission as\n6\n\n\fa monitoring body, the Respondent State does not contest the existence of the Charter itself. The\nCommission observes that, unlike some other international human rights systems where the substantive\nrights and their monitoring bodies are dealt within two complementary but different instruments, in the\nAfrican system, the same instrument, the African Charter, makes provisions for substantive rights and\norganises their monitoring mechanism5 . Under the Charter, therefore, States Parties are not given the\noption of recognising the substantive rights without accepting the jurisdiction of the African Commission,\nwhich was established to promote and protect those rights.\n79. The Commission concludes that the termination of the OAU Charter and subsequent dissolution of the\nOAU does not affect its existence. The Commission is still in existence and performs its activities within the\nframework of the AU.\n80. Regarding the jurisdiction of the Commission over immigration matters, the Commission is of the view\nthat there is no provision in the African Charter or in the Constitutive Act excluding the jurisdiction of the\nAfrican Commission over such matters. The jurisdiction of the Commission is founded by Article 45 of the\nAfrican Charter which reads: \"The functions of the Commission shall be [to]: 2. Ensure the protection of\nhuman and peoples' rights under conditions laid down by the present Charter.\"\n81. This provision should be read together with the relevant substantive provisions of the Charter to find out\nwhether, under its protection mandate, the Commission has jurisdiction over a given matter. Regarding\nspecifically immigration matters, Article 12 of the Charter states that:\n1. \"Every individual shall have the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of a\n2.\nState provided he abides by the law.\n3. Every individual shall have the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his\ncountry. This right may only be subject to restrictions, provided for by law for the protection of\nnational security, law and order, public health or morality.\n4. Every individual shall have the right, when persecuted, to seek and obtain asylum in other countries\nin accordance with the law of those countries and international conventions.\n5. A non-national legally admitted in a territory of a State Party to the present Charter, may only be\nexpelled from it by virtue of a decision taken in accordance with the law.\n6. The mass expulsion of non-nationals shall be prohibited. Mass expulsion shall be that which is\naimed at national, racial, ethnic or religious groups.\"\n82. It appears from the provision of Article 45(2), read together with Article 12, that the Commission has\njurisdiction when some human rights related to immigration are involved. The mandate of the Commission\nin that case is to make sure that, immigration policies and practices do not infringe upon those rights.\nHence, the Commission finds that it has jurisdiction over immigration matters.\n83. The Commission is of the view that the competence given to it over immigration matters under Article\n45(2) and Article 12 of the Charter, does not overlap with the mandate of the Executive Council, under\nArticle 13(1)(j)\n× 1. The Executive Council shall coordinate and take decisions on policies in areas of common interest to\nthe Member States, including the following: (j) nationality, residency and immigration matters;\nof the Constitutive Act, over the same matters because the two bodies do not perform the same kind of\nactivity. While the Commission is an international quasi-judicial institution established to promote and\nprotect the rights enshrined in the African Charter, the Executive Council is a political organ, which\n\"coordinate[s] and take[s] decisions on policies in areas of common interest to the member states [of the\nAfrican Union], including...nationality, residency and immigration matters\"6 .\n84. Having dealt with the preliminary objections raised by the Respondent State regarding the existence\nand jurisdiction of the Commission, the latter will now proceed to make a determination on the admissibility\nor otherwise of this communication.\nThe Commission's analysis on admissibility\n\n85. The admissibility of communications submitted before the African Commission in accordance with\nArticle 55 is governed by the requirements of Article 56 of the African Charter. In terms of Article 56:\n\"Communications relating to human and peoples' rights referred to in Article 55 received by the\nCommission, shall be considered if they:\n\n7\n\n\f1. Indicate their authors even if the latter requests anonymity,\n2. Are compatible with the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present Charter,\n3. Are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned and its\ninstitutions or to the Organisation of African Unity,\n4. Are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media,\n5. Are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly\nprolonged,\n6. Are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted or from the\ndate the Commission is seized with the matter, and\n7. Do not deal with cases which have been settled by those States involved in accordance with the\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, or the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or\nthe provisions of the present Charter.\"\n86. The African Commission is of the view that this communication establishes a prima facie violation of the\nprovisions of the African Charter, and is compatible with both the Constitutive Act of the African Union and\nthe African Charter. The African Commission also does not believe that there has been any use of a\ndisparaging or insulting language against the Government of the Republic of Botswana or any of its\ninstitutions or the African Union.\n87. Regarding the disclosure of documents, the Commission finds that the documents submitted by the\nComplainants in support of the claim sufficiently prove that the communication is not based on fiction or on\nnews disseminated by the mass media. The Commission concurs, therefore, that the condition of Article\n56(4) has been met. The Commission also notes that all the documents submitted by the Complainants\nhave been disclosed to the Respondent State.\n88. The Commission recalls its established jurisprudence whereby the exhaustion of local remedies\nreferred to in Article 56(5) 'entails remedy sought from the courts of a judicial nature.'7 Such a judicial\nremedy shall be effective and shall not be subordinated to the discretionary power of public authorities8 .\nThe Commission has also affirmed on several occasions that it is not necessary, for the sake of meeting\nthe condition of Article 56(5), to seek 'remedies from a source which does not operate impartially and have\nno obligation to decide according to legal principles' 9 .\n89. In the present communication, the victim challenged the decision expelling him from Botswana before\nthe domestic courts. His application before the High Court of Botswana was dismissed, as was a further\nappeal that he filed with the Court of Appeal, the highest judicial authority in Botswana. The Commission\nfinds therefore that all local remedies have been exhausted. The Commission is of the view that the\npresidential review referred to by the Respondent State is not of a judicial nature and is subject to the\ndiscretionary power of the President, the very authority that ordered the expulsion of the victim. The\nCommission considers that such a remedy is not effective and the victim is not obliged to utilise it.\n90. The Commission further finds that the other arguments10 submitted by the State against the\nadmissibility of the communication are based on substantive rights protected under the Charter, including\nthe rights, the violation of which is complained of by the applicant, to such an extent that dealing with them\nat this stage of the procedure would be pushing the Commission to jump the gun to consider the\ncommunication on the merits. The Commission therefore will not pronounce on them but would rather deal\nwith them at the appropriate stage.\n91. From the above submissions, this Commission is of the view that the present communication\nsufficiently complies with the requirements under Article 56, relating to the admissibility of communications\nbefore the African Commission and thus decides to declare the communication admissible.\nMerits\nRespondent State's preliminary objection to the Commission's procedure\n\n92. At the 42nd Ordinary Session of the Commission, the Respondent State raised a preliminary objection\nregarding the Commission's procedure in the handling of complaints/communications. The main thrust of\nthe State's objection is that the Commission's procedure relating to the handling of communications was\nnot followed with regards to the present communication. According to the State, Rule 119 of the\nCommission's Rules of Procedure was not respected, and as a result, both parties to the communication,\nthe Respondent State and the Complainants, made submissions to the Commission at almost the same\n8\n\n\ftime, making it difficult to respond to issues raised by either party.\n93. The Respondent State submits that the Commission had asked both parties to submit their arguments\non the merits, giving both parties the same deadline. Both parties sent their arguments to the Secretariat of\nthe Commission at almost the same time, and the Commission then forwarded the submissions of either\nparty to the other for comments, if any.\n94. The Respondent State contends that this procedure deprives it from properly addressing the issues\nraised by the Complainants as it was not availed a copy of the Complainants' submission prior to the\nRespondent State making its own submission. In the words of the Respondent State \"it prejudices\nBotswana greatly in that the applicant has effectively been afforded an undue opportunity to strengthen his\ncase, to the extent that the submissions filed by him raise very many new matters of fact and law which our\narguments, as is to be expected, do not deal with\". The Respondent State concluded that the\nComplainants' supplementary submissions on the merits be purged off the record.\n95. Referring to Rule 119 of the African Commission's Rules of Procedure, the State maintains that it was\nsupposed to have submitted first and the Complainants given the opportunity to reply within a time fixed by\nthe Commission, in accordance with Rule 119 (3).\n96. The Commission will thus, first deal with the preliminary issue raised by the Respondent State before\nproceeding to make a determination on the merits of the communication.\nAfrican Commission's decision on the preliminary objection\n\n97. In the present communication, after declaring the case admissible at the Commission's 41st Ordinary\nSession, the Secretariat, by Note Verbale of 20th June 2007, and letter of the same date, informed both\nparties and requested them to submit their arguments on the merits within three months from the date of\nnotification. On 5th October 2007, the Secretariat received the Complainants' submissions on the merits of\nthe communication. On 12th October 2007, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submissions on\nthe merits. On 22nd October 2007, the Secretariat forwarded the submissions of the Respondent State to\nthe Complainants, and the Complainants to the Respondent State.\n98. The purpose of requiring parties to make submissions to the Commission is so that they appreciate the\nconcerns of each other and try to address them as best as they can. That is why the Commission adopted\nRules of Procedure governing, among other things, the receipt and consideration of communications.\n99. Rule 119 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure seek to guide the Commission regarding the\nprocedure to adopt after a communication has been declared admissible. In terms of Rule 119 (1) \"if the\nCommission decides that a communication is admissible...its decision and text of the relevant documents\nshall as soon as possible, be submitted to the State Party concerned...The author of the communication\nshall also be informed of the Commission's decision...\". Rule 119 (2) provides further that the State Party\n\"... shall within the ensuing three months, submit in writing to the Commission, ...measures it was able to\ntake to remedy the situation\".\n100. From the above two paragraphs of Rule 119, it is the view of the Commission that when a\ncommunication is declared admissible, both parties must be notified of the decision. While the African\nCharter obliges the Commission to submit its decisions and other relevant texts relating to its decision on\nadmissibility to the State Party, it simply requires the Commission to inform the author of the\ncommunication. This presupposes that the Respondent State is the one that is expected to make\nsubmissions on the merits, to, in the words of the Charter, provide \"explanations or statements elucidating\nthe issue under consideration and indicating, if possible, measures it was able to take to remedy the\nsituation\".\n101. This interpretation is supported when one turns to Rule 119 (3) which provides that 'all explanations or\nstatements submitted by a State Party pursuant to the present Rule shall be communicated... to the author\nof the communication, who may submit in writing additional information and observations within a time limit\nfixed by the Commission'.\n102. It is clear from the above, that after declaring a communication admissible, both parties are informed\nof the decision, but the Respondent State is further requested to make submissions on the matter being\nconsidered. After the State would have submitted, then the submission is availed to the author of the\ncommunication for his/her comments. The Respondent State seems to be satisfied that the Note Verbale of\n20th June inviting it to make submissions on the merits \"was the correct step\".\n103. However, the Respondent State contends that if the Complainants were also invited to make\nsubmissions on the merits \"that was a defective step and clearly the Commission will be guilty of breaking\n9\n\n\fits own procedural rules\".\n104. The procedure of letting one party submit first and inviting the other to respond will give both parties\nthe opportunity to address the issues or concerns of the other. This exchange of submissions between the\nState and the author of the communication can continue until the Commission is satisfied that it has had\nenough information to make a decision on the matter.\n105. The African Commission thus concurs with the Respondent State that when parties are asked to\nsubmit at the same time, it does not give both of them the opportunity to respond to issues that are raised\nby the other party.\n106. This notwithstanding, the practice of the Commission is clear. Where it receives submissions from one\nparty, it sends the same to the other party for their comments. Thus, even if the parties make submissions\nat the same time, the other party is not prejudiced in any way because they are still given an opportunity to\nrespond to the submissions before the Commission can make a determination. This was the situation with\nrespect to the present communication.\n107. The Secretariat received the State's submissions on 12th October 2007 and sent same to the\nComplainants on 22nd October 2007. Thus, the Respondent State was sent the Complainant's submissions\nand the Complainants were sent the State's submissions, and both parties were entitled to send comments,\nif any.\n108. Thus, even though Rule 119 was not followed to the letter, the Respondent State has not indicated\nhow it was prejudiced by this lapse, to the advantage of the Complainants. The Respondent State has been\ngiven an equal opportunity to respond to the submissions of the Complainants just as the Complainants\nhave been given an opportunity to respond to the State's submissions.\n109. The Commission accordingly takes note of the fact that Rule 119 of its Rules of Procedure was not\nfollowed to the letter, and undertakes to ensure that it is complied with in the future. It holds that since the\nRespondent State has been given time to respond to the Complainants' submission, its argument that the\nComplainants' submissions on the matter be purged from the record cannot stand. The African Commission\naccordingly requests both parties to submit their responses, within three months, on the arguments made\nby either party.\n\nComplainants' submissions on the merits\n\n110. The Complainants allege that the existence and application of the Botswana Immigration Act has\nviolated Articles 1, 2, 7(1) (a), 9, 12(4) and 18 of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 1\n\n111. With respect to the alleged violation of Article 1 of the African Charter, Complainants submit that the\nCharter was adopted and acceded to voluntarily by African States and that once ratified, States Parties to\nthe Charter are legally bound by its provisions, adding that States wishing not to be bound ought to have\nrefrained from ratifying.\n112. The Complainants refer to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which states\nthat \"a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith and in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to\nthe terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". The Complainants also\nmake reference to Legal Resources Foundation v Zambia11 where the Commission stated that the African\nCharter must be interpreted holistically and all clauses must reinforce each other. The African Charter must\nalso be interpreted, in light of international norms and consistently with the approach of the other regional\nand international human rights bodies.\n113. The Complainants assert that the fact that the African Charter has not been incorporated into\nBotswana domestic law may preclude persons in Botswana from relying on the provisions of the Charter\nbefore local courts but does not affect recourse to the Commission under the African Charter. States are\nbound by their ratification of the African Charter whether monist or dualist and even where it revokes the\ndomestic effect of the Charter12 . Consequently, they argue, all the provisions of the African Charter\naddressed below indicate the Respondent State's failure to respect the African Charter and to ensure its full\nimplementation in violation of Article 1 of the same.\n\n10\n\n\fAlleged Violation of Articles 7(1)(a)&12(4)\n\n114. The Complainants allege that the victim was deprived by law from accessing information relating to\nthe reasons for his being declared a threat to national security, which in turn denied judicial authorities the\nright to review the President's decisions. Together, these denials, according to the Complainants, amount\nto a clear violation of the right to appeal to competent judicial organs, a situation that affects the right to be\nheard. In this regard, they contend that the right to be heard entails the right to challenge in a court of law,\ndecisions that affect the individual's fundamental rights13 .\n115. Depending on Sections 7(f), 11(6) and 36 of the Botswana Immigration Act, the Complainants aver\nthat the courts that determined the victim's application and appeal prior to and following his expulsion,\nfound that he had no right to any information regarding the President's decision, and that the courts had no\npower to question the reason for his expulsion and that there was no legal limit to the unfettered discretion\nof the President.\n116. According to the Complainants, the victim was not afforded any meaningful opportunity to challenge\nhis expulsion either by way of hearing before the expulsion order was made, or by way of appeal after the\norder was made. He was not provided with the reasons for his expulsion and was accordingly not afforded\nan opportunity to challenge those reasons or provide evidence which might contradict them. He was neither\ngiven any remedy in respect of the violations of his rights. These decisions and the underlying provisions of\nSections 11(6) and 36 of the Immigration Act, according to the Complainants, are inconsistent with basic\nprinciples of due process enshrined in Article 7 of the African Charter.\n117. The Complainants aver that any decision passed \"in accordance with the law\" as provided under\nArticle 12(4) of the African Charter should fulfil the following three requirements: one, it should be provided\nin a clear and accessible law to offer predictability and to guard against arbitrariness; two, it \"...must be\nmade by a court or an administrative authority on the basis of a law affording protection against arbitrary\nexpulsion through the establishment of corresponding procedural guarantees\"14 In relation with this they\nrefer to the Commission's decision in Modise v Botswana15 where the Commission stated that \"in\naccordance with law\" requires not only strict conformity with national law, but also with the principles of the\nAfrican Charter and other international norms. Third, he contends that the procedural guarantees under\nArticle 12(4) enshrine the right to meaningful judicial oversight of administrative decisions.\n118. With regard to the issue of national security, the Complainants submit that while the victim's case\nraises no genuine issue of \"national security\", it is noted that, even where such legitimate concerns do\narise, they do not provide a basis to set aside the rights protected in the African Charter. They argue that\nwhile legitimate security concerns can be taken into account in interpreting the African Charter, they cannot\nerode the essence of the rights protected, including the right protected under Article 12(4). The\nComplainants refer to Commission nationale des droits de l'Homme et des libertés v Chad16 where the\nCommission stated that the African Charter does not allow States Parties to derogate from their treaty\nobligations even during emergency situations. They also refer to Amnesty International v Zambia17 where\nthe Commission found a violation of Article 12(4) where the national court did not consider Zambia's\nobligations under the African Charter and failed to rule on the ground that the Complainant was likely to\n\"endanger peace and good order in Zambia\". According to the Commission, \"there was no judicial inquiry\non the basis in law and in terms of administrative justice for relying on this 'opinion' of the Minister of Home\nAffairs for the action taken\".\n119. The Complainants contend that the President did not give reasons for the victim's deportation, neither\ndid he explain or justify his decision and considerations of national security. The President, according to the\nComplainants, applied a law which afforded him an apparently limitless power to make a declaration which\nhas the effect of causing an individual to become [[span class=\"JQ-quotes\"]]\"a prohibited immigrant\". This\npower is attended by a blanket denial of information as to the basis for its exercise. A law of this breadth\nand potentially all encompassing scope, the Complainants argue, lacks the clarity and precision required of\n>\n\n11\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"5","date":"May 26, 2010","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"","keywords":"Regional human rights law, Right to fair trial, Right to information, Freedom of expression, Freedom of movement, National law, Discrimination, Damages and compensation for victims, Protection of the family and vulnerable groups","activity_report":"28th Activity Report: Nov 2009 – May 2010","outcome":"19"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080ca576","title":"Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre  Sudan","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"1-5ac4c7ec6e2081373a3a742d01c1148f","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1463559478531,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"310_05 Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre _ Sudan.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1463559479556tbohdp1mebrfi529.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1463559479556tbohdp1mebrfi529.pdf","size":48596},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"310/05 Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre /\nSudan\nSummary of Facts\n1. This communication is submitted by the Darfur Relief and Documentation Centre (DRDC) (hereinafter\ncalled the complainant), on behalf of 33 Sudanese citizens (hereinafter referred to as victims) against the\nRepublic of Sudan1 (hereinafter called the Respondent State).\n2. The Complainant states that the victims were hired by the Iraqi - owned Southern Oil Company in the\nearly 1980s as drivers, mechanics, electricians, cooks, servants and manual workers in the oil fields of the\nsaid company in Basra City (Southern Iraq).\n3. On 22nd and 23rd February 1983 the said victims were arrested during the first Gulf War between Iran\nand Iraq and taken to Iranian territory on 24th February 1983 as civilian war detainees where they were\ndetained in special military prisons, until 5th October 1990 (seven years), when they were released and\nrepatriated to Sudan.\n4. The Complainant submits that while in detention, the victims lost their sources of income and were\nunable to communicate with their families and lawyers; they were psychologically and physically tortured,\nhad no access to medical treatment and could not carry out their religious rituals.\n5. Following the victims' release from prison, the Iraqi government agreed to meet part of the unpaid\nsalaries for the years that they had spent in Iranian custody. No arrangements were made to pay\ncompensation, damages or reparations for the suffering caused to the victims during their detention.\n6. A total of US$ 500,000, paid in Sudanese currency at the exchange rate of the day of payment, was to\nbe given to the detainees and divided evenly among all of them. It was agreed by the governments of\nSudan and Iraq that the said amounts would be paid to the victims through the Ministry of Finance and\nEconomic Planning in Khartoum. (See supporting documents No. 1, 2, and 3).The two governments further\nagreed that the full amount would be deducted from the debt that Sudan owed Iraq.\n7. The complainant submits further that the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in Khartoum\ninformed the victims about the payment arrangements reached between Sudan and Iraq (See supporting\ndocument No. 4). The victims accepted the payment terms despite the fact that they were not part of the\nnegotiations that led to the payment agreement reached between Sudan and Iraq. This included payment\nin Sudanese currency and yet their salaries had been earmarked in US dollars.\n8. The complainant alleges that on 20th March 1992, the Sudanese Ministry of Finance and Economic\nPlanning approved the payments to the victims and instructed the bank of Sudan to effect the said\npayments. (See supporting document No. 5). Subsequently, on 15th April 1993 and 10th May 1993, a total\nof US$ 167,367 (SP 22,700,000) was paid to the victims as the first instalment. (see supporting document\nNo.6) Each victim received the equivalent of US$ 5,230. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning\npromised to pay the remaining balance amounting to US$ 332,633 at a later date.\n9. Payment of the remaining balance due to the victim was delayed and the complainant states that the\nMinistry of Finance and Economic Planning eventually refused to pay the said amount altogether. The\ncomplainant alleges that the then First Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning,\nMr Hassan Mohamed Taha was responsible for ensuring that the said amounts were not paid to the\nvictims.\n10. The complainant submits that the victims have attempted to use all the legal and political avenues\navailable in order to have their rights recognised and recover the monies owed them but to no avail.\n\nArticles alleged to have been violated\n11. The Complainant alleges that Articles 1, 2, 5, 7(1)(a), 14 and 16(1) of the African Charter on Human\nand Peoples' Rights have been violated.\n\n1\n\n\fPrayers\n\n12. The complainant requests the African Commission to urge the government of Sudan to -:\n• Pay the outstanding balance due to the victims which currently amounts to US$ 2,965,789, taking\ninto account the accumulated benefit over the years or rebeeh2 specified under the Islamic Banking\nsystem applied in Sudan;\n• Pay an additional US$3 million in compensation for the material, social and psychological damage\nand disruption of life that the victims have endured during the last 13 years. This brings the total\namount being requested to US$5,965,789.\n13. The Complainant further requests that in case of delay in satisfactorily settling the communication and\neffecting payment, similar benefits should be paid during 2006 and the subsequent years, as well as, US$\n1,000,000 compensation for each additional year from 1st January 2006. The complainant seeks payment\nof the above balance, benefits and compensation in US currency to be divided equally between the victims.\n\nProcedure\n14. The communication is dated 22nd November 2005 and was received by the Secretariat of the African\nCommission on 24th November 2005.\n15. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005, in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nAfrican Commission considered the communication and decided to be seized of it.\n16. By Note Verbale dated 8th December 2005, the Secretariat transmitted a copy of the communication to\nthe Respondent State by DHL and requested it to forward its submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\nThe complainant was also requested to send its submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\n17. On 13th February 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received the complainants'\nsubmissions on admissibility and acknowledged receipt of the same in a letter dated 14th February 2006. A\ncopy of the complainants' submissions on admissibility was forwarded to the Respondent State by fax and\nemail.\n18. By Note Verbale dated 20th March 2006, the Respondent State was reminded to forward its written\nsubmission on admissibility of the communication.\n19. On 20th May 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a Note Verbale dated 20 May\n2006 and attached to it was the State's submission on admissibility.\n20. During the 39 Ordinary Session of the African Commission, the Commission decided to defer its\ndecision on admissibility of the communication to its 40th Ordinary Session. By letter and Note Verbale\ndated 31st May 2006, the Secretariat informed the complainant and the State respectively, of the\nCommission's decision to defer the communication to its 40th Session.\n21. By email dated 16th April 2007, the Secretariat received a letter dated 10th April 2007, from the\ncomplainant, which had attached to it, additional submissions and documents in reply to the submissions of\nthe Respondent State.\n22. At its 40th Ordinary Session, the African Commission decided to defer the communication for further\nconsideration on admissibility, to its 41st Ordinary Session.\n23. During its 41st Ordinary Session which was held in Accra, Ghana, the Secretariat of the African\nCommission received, on the 22nd of May 2007, a letter to the African Commission to which was attached\nfurther submissions by the complainant in reply to the Respondent State's submission on admissibility.\n24. At the 41st Ordinary Session of the African Commission, the decision on admissibility of the\ncommunication was further deferred to the 42nd Ordinary Session.\n25. At the 42nd Session of the African Commission the decision on admissibility of this communication was\ndeferred, to get clarification on some issues from the complainants.\n26. At the 43rd Session the Secretariat was yet to receive the complainants response and as a result\ndeferred the communication to the 44th Ordinary Session.\n27. The communication was further deferred during the 44th Session to give time to the Secretariat to draft\nits decision on admissibility.\n\n2\n\n\fThe Law\nAdmissibility\nSummary of the complainant's arguments on admissibility of the communication\n\n28. The Complainant states that a letter was addressed to the President of Sudan HE Omar El Bashir\nrequesting him to intervene in the matter and resolve the case. (Attachment No. 7).\n29. After studying the relevant documents relating to this matter, the Solicitor General, on 5th September\n2000 forwarded a legal opinion to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning confirming that the\nvictims were entitled to the payment of the outstanding balance held by the said Ministry. (Attachment\nNo.9).\n30. On 28th August 2001, Dr Maghzoub Al Khalifa, the then Chair of the Joint Iraqi-Sudanese Ministerial\nCommittee and a former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of Sudan, sent a letter to the Ministry of\nFinance and Economic Planning reminding them of the agreement between the Sudanese and Iraqi\ngovernments and requesting them to pay the victims the outstanding amounts without delay. (Attachment\nNo. 8). Complainant states that since attempts at solving the matter amicably had failed, the victims\ndecided to pursue the matter in the courts of law.\n32. The Complainant states that on 18th June 2000, the victims in this matter filed a complaint against the\nMinistry of Finance and Economic Planning before the Court of First Instance in Khartoum. The case - No.\nAM/1724/2000 was dismissed by the Court on 21st March 2000 (Attachment No. 10). The victims appealed\nagainst the judgment of the Court of First Instance before the Court of Appeal in case no. ASM/475/2001.\nOn 7th July 2001, the Court of Appeal issued an order to the Court of First Instance to reconsider its\njudgement and on 19th February 2002 the Court of First Instance dismissed the case once again.\n(Attachment No. 10).\n33. The victims appealed against the second judgment of the Court of First Instance to the Court of Appeal\nin Khartoum in Case No. ASM/250/2002) and on 26th December 2002, the Court of Appeal upheld the\njudgment of the Court of First Instance and dismissed the case. (Attachment No. 11).\n34. The victims approached the High Court in Khartoum, Civil Circuit in case MA/TM/165/2003 for an\ninjunction against the ruling of the Court of Appeal. However, on 18th June 2003, the High Court decided to\nuphold the ruling of the Court of Appeal and dismissed the matter. (Attachment No. 11). The complainants\nallege that the decisions of the court of first instance, Court of Appeal and the High Court, to dismiss the\ncase, were based on technicalities and not on the spirit of justice, law and good conscience.\n35. Consequently, the Complainant submits that the victims have exhausted all domestic remedies by\nvirtue of the ruling of the High Court on 18th June 2003, which dismissed the case.\n36. The Complainant submits that when reaching their judgments, the courts neglected to take into account\nelementary facts that would have favoured the victims' case. For instance, the fact that the victims received\na part payment in respect of the agreement reached between Sudan and Iraq and that the Ministry of\nFinance and Economic Planning made an undertaking to pay the victims the outstanding balance; failure to\ntake into account the legal opinion of the Solicitor General stating that he was not a witness to specific\nincidents. They also claim that the decisions of these Courts to dismiss the matter were based on\ntechnicalities and not on the spirit of fairness, law and justice.\n37. The Complainant submits further that the Sudanese domestic courts are not competent to deal with a\ncase of such magnitude and notes that the High Court when delivering its judgement in respect of the\napplication for an injunction stated that the amount of financial indemnification claimed in this case\nsupersedes the amount fixed by the Judicial Circular No. 44/99 which is a necessary condition for\nacceptance of an injunction before the High Court.\n38. Additionally, the Complainant avers that the courts in Sudan failed to take into consideration the fact\nthat the then ruling regime in Iraq was totalitarian and that the one in Sudan is military and as such citizens\nare unable to interfere with government decisions or procure the necessary documents that could prove\ntheir cases in a court of law.\n39. For these reasons, the Complainant submits that the domestic judicial process was flawed and could\nnot render justice to the victims.\n\n3\n\n\f40. The Complainant states that Sudan has been under totalitarian military government headed by a\nPresident who is still an active army officer since 30th June 1989. Consequently, the regime pursues a\nsystematic policy of control and domination at all levels of the State apparatus including the judiciary whose\nprocedure and decisions are not respected. As a result, Sudanese citizens, groups and organisations are\nunable to submit cases relating to human rights before the courts of law for fear of harassment, threats and\nintimidation by the government security agents.\n41. To illustrate that the judiciary is not independent, the complainant refers the African Commission to the\nannual reports the then UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Sudan in the\nFifty-eighth3 and the Fifty-ninth4 Sessions of the UN Commission on Human Rights which make reference\nto the lack of independence of the judiciary in Sudan. Furthermore, the complainant states that the\nInternational Commission of Inquiry on Darfur (ICID), established by the UN Security Council in October\n2004 to investigate crimes committed within the context of the armed conflict in Darfur also examined the\njudicial system in Sudan as part of its mandate. In its report of 25th January 2005, the ICID gives a\ncomprehensive overview of the Sudanese judicial system5 . The Complainant submits that the report\nacknowledges that during the last decade the judiciary appeared to have been manipulated and politicised\nand as such judges who disagreed with the government often suffered harassment, including dismissals.6\n42. The Complainant notes that, the Commission of Inquiry stated that it \"considers that in view of the\nimpunity which reigns in Darfur today, the judicial system has demonstrated that it lacks adequate\nstructures, authority, credibility...\" 7\n43. The Complainant also draws the attention of the African Commission to its decision in Amnesty\nInternational, Comité Loosli Bachelard, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Association of Members of\nthe Episcopal Conference of East Africa/Sudan8 in which the Commission found that the judiciary in Sudan\nwas not independent. The Complainant states that even after this pronouncement by the Commission, the\nsituation in Sudan has not improved but has in fact deteriorated in manifolds, as more judges are purged\nfrom the judiciary and supporters of the government were appointed in their place.\nSummary of the Respondent State's submission on Admissibility\n\n44. The Respondent State starts by stating that the judicial system of the Sudan is one of the most\ncompetent and efficient organs of the State based on the principle of its total independence and the\nprinciple of separation of powers. It goes further to state that the judicial system is efficient, honest and\ncharacterised with competence. The State submits that the Sudan is one of the few African States which\nhas a Supreme Court in every Province and a judicial system which is available to all.\n45. The State contends that the complainants have not fulfilled the conditions stated in Article 56 of the\nAfrican Charter. The Respondent State submits that the complaint has not complied with the condition in\nArticle 56(5) of the African Charter which provides for the exhaustion of local remedies before a\nCommunication is brought before the African Commission.\n46. The State submits in this regard, that the complainants are afforded the opportunity to have their cases\nheard by the Constitutional Court and Department of Grievances these are the two mechanisms put in\nplace by the Constitution of Sudan, for the protection of human rights. The State substantiates this claim\nwith documents on statistics illustrating the judicial performance in the Sudan and states that the\ncomplainants are yet to exhaust all these avenues which are available to them.\n47. The Respondent State claims that the provision of Article 56(1) was not fulfilled because the complaint\n\"was submitted by a so-called Abdul-Baqui Jubril on behalf of Darfur Centre for Relief and Documentation\nCentre.\" The State further states that this person continues to lodge complaints which are not backed by\nany evidence or legal basis, sometimes to the Commission, presenting complaints under the umbrella of a\nnumber of civil society organisations.\n48. The State further states that the complainant has failed to comply with the provisions of Article 56(2) of\nthe African Charter and that the complainant's resort to Article 1 of the Charter is not applicable in the\npresent case. The State submits that the ultimate nature of any case is that there is a winner and a loser\nand states further that the Charter requires that there is compliance with the law when rights of individuals\nand groups are discussed. It goes further to state that it is unacceptable to say that the judgments passed\nby the courts are in violation of human rights, that these judgments testify to the reality and are in keeping\nwith the letter and spirit of the African Charter and the AU Charter and that any assumption contrary to that\nshall be tantamount to denying the courts of the member States of their functions.\n49. The State goes further to state that the international human rights instruments recognise the\n4\n\n\fsovereignty of States and the rule of the natural law existing in these States and that any assumption to the\ncontrary is itself a blatant violation of the law.\n50. The Respondent State further submits that the complaint is not in compliance with Article 56(3) of the\nAfrican Charter, which provides that a communication brought before the Commission should not be written\nin insulting or disparaging language. The State contends that the complainants' submissions, especially in\npara. 40 of the communication contained statements which had improper utterances against officials as\nwell as the methods of the application of justice and the rule of law in the Sudan.\n51. The Respondent State also submits that the complaint is not in conformity with Article 56(6) of the\nAfrican Charter, which provides that a communication should be brought within a reasonable time after the\nexhaustion of local remedies. The State contends that the present communication was brought before the\nCommission after the expiration of 31 months of the court's judgement.\n52. That for these reasons the communication should be declared inadmissible by the African Commission.\n\nSummary of the complainants' reply to the Respondent State's submission on admissibility\n\n53. The complainant alleges that though the Supreme Court is the highest court in the Sudan, the Civil\nProcedures Act of Sudan provides that the \"Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to determine: Objection\nby way of cassation against the decisions and orders of the Courts of Appeal concerning objections against\nadministrative decisions.\"\n54. The complainant also argues that the communication does not have to do with, nor were it brought\nbefore the Shar'ia Courts; it is a civil suit which was properly brought before the civil law circuit.\n55. Also the complainant submits that the final decision of the High Court which dismissed their case was\nhanded to them by the registrar, more than three months after its pronouncement by the court. This delay\nprevented the petitioners from bringing an application for review of the Supreme Court's judgment within\nthe prescribed period of 15 (fifteen days).\n56. On the contention of the Respondent State that they could bring their matter before the Constitutional\nCourt, the complainants state that the Sudan's Constitutional Bill of 2005, outlines the jurisdiction, functions\nand powers of the Constitutional Court. This Bill provides that the Constitutional Court has no jurisdiction to\nreview judgements, decisions, proceedings, and orders passed by the judiciary. This means that the\nConstitutional Court lacks the competence to entertain matters that were already dealt with by other Courts.\n57. The complainant also alleges that the victims' ordeal with the Sudanese authorities has been going on\nsince 1993, when the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning failed to pay the remaining balance of the\nfunds. The victims then started proceedings in the courts in 2000, which was finally dismissed by the High\nCourt in June 2003, and according to the Complainants, the victims have exhausted all means possible at\ntheir disposal to recover their outstanding funds to no avail.\n58. The complainant also allege that the judiciary of the Sudan is not independent of the government in the\ndischarge of its duties. This it alleges is due to the fact that the country is ruled by a totalitarian military\nregime. That the government pursues a systematic policy of tight control and domination at all levels of the\nState apparatus including the judiciary.\n59. The complainant alleges that in view of the above facts, it has exhausted all possibilities for local\nremedy in the Sudanese courts and seek that the African Commission finds this communication admissible.\nAnalysis on admissibility\n\n60. The admissibility of communications within the African Commission is governed by the requirements of\nArticle 56 of the African Charter. This Article provides seven requirements which must all be met before the\nCommission can declare a communication admissible. If one of the conditions/requirements is not met, the\nCommission will declare the communication inadmissible, unless the complainant provides sufficient\njustifications why any of the requirements could not be met.\n61. In the present communication, the complainant claims that it has fulfilled all the requirements of Article\n56 of the African Charter. The Respondent State on the other hand submits that five requirements of\nadmissibility, that is, Articles 56(1), 56(2), 56(3), 56(5), and 56(6), have not been met.\n62. Article 56(1) of the African Charter states that \"Communication relating to Human and Peoples' Rights...\nreceived by the Commission shall be considered if they indicate their authors even if the latter request\nanonymity...\"\n5\n\n\f63. According to the Respondent State, the communication does not indicate the authors. The\ncommunication received by the African Commission indicates that the author of the communication is the\nDarfur Relief and Documentation Centre which brought the communication on behalf of 33 Sudanese\nnationals whose names are stated in the communication. This means that the author of the communication\nand the victims are clearly identified. The Commission therefore holds that the requirement under Article\n56(1) of the African Charter has been met* .\n64. The State also submits that the communication is incompatible with the Charter of the Organisation for\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and as such does not comply with Article 56(2), of the African Charter. This sub-Article\nprovides that \"Communications...received by the Commission shall be considered if they are compatible\nwith the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present Charter.\" In the present case, there\nis evidence of prima facie violation of the African Charter in the refusal of the Ministry of Finance and\nEconomic Planning (an institution of the Sudanese government), to pay the outstanding balance of the\nmoney due to the 33 Sudanese nationals in breach of the agreement between the Sudanese and Iraqi\ngovernments to pay them this money as compensation for their time in Iranian prisons. Secondly in view of\nthe compatibility requirements, Sudan is a State Party to the African Charter. Thirdly the Republic of Sudan\nbecame party to the Charter on 18th February, 1986, the alleged violations in this communication falls\nwithin the period of the Charter's application to Sudan. Lastly, the alleged violation took place within the\nterritorial sphere which the Charter applies. For these reasons, the Commission holds that the\ncommunication has sufficiently fulfilled the requirement of Article 56(2) of the African Charter.\n65. In its submission, the State calls on the African Commission to declare the communication inadmissible\non the ground that it does not comply with Article 56(3) of the African Charter which states that\n\"communications ...received by the Commission shall be considered if they are not written in disparaging or\ninsulting language directed against the State concerned and its institutions or to the Organisation of African\nUnity (AU)\".\n66. The Respondent State objects to the statements made by the Complainant in para. 40 of the complaint\narguing that it is improper to describe any sovereign State as such. Paragraph 40 of the complaint states\nthat \"This Communication documents a situation of absolute misuse of government authority and executive\npowers to inflict gross injustice and suffering among a vulnerable segment of the Sudanese citizens. This\nsituation is a classical example of the absence of accountability of public officials and for the lack of proper\nadministration of justice and the rule of law in Sudan.\"\n67. In its decision on admissibility in Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights/ Zimbabwe(ZLHR)9 , the African\nCommission stated inter alia that \"in determining whether a certain remark is disparaging or insulting and\nwhether it has dampened the integrity of the judiciary, the Commission has to satisfy itself whether the said\nremark or language is aimed at unlawfully and intentionally violating the dignity, reputation or integrity of a\njudicial officer or body and whether it is used in a manner calculated to pollute the minds of the public or\nany reasonable man to cast aspersions on and weaken public confidence on the administration of justice.\nThe language must be aimed at undermining the integrity and status of the institution and bring it into\ndisrepute. To this end, Article 56(3) must be interpreted bearing in mind Article 9(2) of the African Charter\nwhich provides that \"every individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinions within the\nlaw\". A balance must be struck between the right to speak freely and the duty to protect state institutions to\nensure that while discouraging abusive language, the African Commission is not at the same time violating\nor inhibiting the enjoyment of other rights guaranteed in the African Charter, such as in this case, the right\nto freedom of expression.\"\n68. The decision taken in ZLHR should be distinguished from another decision of the African Commission\nin Ligue Camerounaise des Droits de l'Homme/ Cameroon10 , where the African Commission held that the\nCommunication was inadmissible because of the complainant's use of language like \"[President] Paul Biya\nmust respond to crimes against humanity\", \"30 years of the criminal neo-colonial/regime\", \"regime of\ntorturers\", \"government barbarisms\" e.t.c., as this was considered as insulting language.\n69. The Respondent State in this communication does not expressly state that the communication was\ninsulting or disparaging but however noted that the language used is \"improper\" . In the opinion of the\nAfrican Commission, the language used in the communication, and especially in Para. 40, is not insulting or\ndisparaging to the Government of Sudan and as such, is not contrary to Article 56(3). For this reason, the\nCommission holds that the proviso under Article 56(3) has been complied with.\n70. Article 56(4) of the Charter provides that a communication would be admissible if it is \"...not based\nexclusively on news disseminated by the mass media\". There is nothing in this communication which has\nshown that it was based on news by the mass media and none of the parties have contested that point. To\n6\n\n\fthis end the African commission holds that this proviso has been fulfilled.\n71. The Respondent State further submits that the communication does not comply with Article 56(5) of the\nAfrican Charter which requires that \"communications...received by the Commission shall be considered: if\nthey are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly\nprolonged\". The Commission has stated that the justification for this requirement is that a government\nshould be aware of a human rights violation in order to have a chance to remedy such violation, thus\nprotecting its reputation which may be tarnished by being called to plead its case before an international\nbody. This requirement also precludes the African Commission from becoming a tribunal of first instance, a\nfunction which it cannot fulfil practically or legally.\n72. In the present case, the Respondent State contends that the complainant has not exhausted local\nremedies available to it in the Sudan. The State submits that the complainant has not brought its case\nbefore the Supreme Court for review and have also not taken the matter to the Constitutional Courts on\nappeal. Article 15 (2) of the Constitutional Court Act of Sudan (as amended in 2005), stipulates that\n\"...there shall not be subject, to review of the Constitutional Court, the business of the Judiciary, the\njudgements, decisions, proceedings and orders passed by the Courts thereof\". This means that the\nConstitutional Court has no jurisdiction to entertain appeals arising from judgements, decisions,\nproceedings, and orders passed by the Judiciary.\n73. The author alleges that the matter was first brought before the Court of first instance, but the case was\ndismissed, an appeal of this ruling was made to the Court of Appeal which ordered reconsideration of the\nmatter in the court of first instance. The case was dismissed a second time by the court of first instance and\nthis time the judgement was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The victims then brought the case before the\nHigh Court which approved the judgement of the Court of First Instance and dismissed the case. The\ncomplainant claims that there is no other Court where they could take the case.\n74. The Respondent State has however pointed out that there is still an option of taking the case before the\nConstitutional Court of the Sudan, available to the Complainants. The Constitutional Court Act of Sudan\nprovides that \"...The Court.... shall assume protection of the rights of a human being and the fundamental\nfreedoms thereof\" 11 This, according to the State, means that the complainant can still take its case on the\nalleged violation of the rights of the 33 Sudanese, to the Constitutional Court of Sudan for a remedy of the\ncomplaint. The African Commission therefore holds that not all the local remedies which are available to the\ncomplainants have been exhausted in accordance with Article 56(5) of the Charter, and as such the\ncommunication has not fulfilled this provision.\n75. Regarding the requirement under Article 56(6) of the African Charter which provides that\n\"Communications...received by the Commission shall be considered if they are submitted within a\nreasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted, or from the date the Commission is seized\nwith the matter,...\" . The African Commission notes that the Charter does not provide for what constitutes \"a\nreasonable period of time,\" and neither has it defined reasonable time. For this reason, the African\nCommission would therefore treat each case on its own merits12 .\n76. Articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter provides that the African Commission, in deciding matters\nbrought before it, should draw inspiration from international law on human and peoples' rights. The African\nCommission in this communication would look at the jurisprudence of the European Court on Human\nRights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The European Convention on Human Rights\nand Fundamental Freedoms provides that the (European) >13 , after this period has elapsed, the European\nCourt on Human Rights will declare such Application inadmissible. The American Convention on Human\nRights also provides that to be declared admissible, \"the petition or communication is lodged within a period\nof six months from the date on which the party alleging violation of his rights was notified of the final\njudgment\" 14 The Convention went further to provide circumstances where this provision will not be\napplicable to include when \"...there has been unwarranted delay in rendering a final judgment under the\naforementioned remedies\".\n77. The Inter American Commission on Human Rights has indicated that the six month period provided for\nin Article 46(1)(b) of the American Convention \"has a twofold purpose: to ensure legal certainty and to\nprovide the person concerned with sufficient time to consider his position\"15\n78. In the present communication, a period of twenty nine (29) months (2 years and 5 months) has elapsed\nbetween the time when the High Court dismissed the matter (18th June 2003), and when the\ncommunication was submitted to the African Commission (24th November 2005). The complainant\nsubmitted this communication way beyond a time which could be considered reasonable, looking at the\nEuropean Court and the Inter- American Court jurisprudence. The complainants have also not given any\n7\n\n\fcompelling reason why there was such a long wait before bringing the matter before the African\nCommission.\n79. The provision of the Charter regarding time limit in Article 56(5) is to make a party complaining of a\nwrong done by a State, to be vigilant and to discourage tardiness from prospective complainants. However,\nwhere there is a good and compelling reason why a complainant does not submit his complaint to the\nCommission for consideration, the Commission has a responsibility, for the sake of fairness and justice, to\ngive such a complainant an opportunity to be heard.\n80. In the present case, there is no sufficient reason given as to why the communication could not be\nsubmitted within a reasonable period. For this reason, the African Commission holds that the\ncommunication does not fulfil the proviso of Article 56(6) of the African Charter.\n\nDecision of the Commission\n81. It must be reiterated that the African Charter provides that all the requirements in Article 56 must be\nfulfilled before a communication will be declared admissible by the African Commission. The Commission\nholds that the provisions of sub-Articles 56(5) and 56(6) of Article 56 have not been fulfilled by the\ncomplainant.\n82. In view of the above, the African Commission decides:\n1.\n2. to declare the communication inadmissible;\n3. to transmit its decision to the parties;\n4. to publish this decision in its 27th Activity Report.\n\nDone in Banjul, The Gambia during the 46th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human\nand Peoples' Rights held from 11th - 25th November 2009.\n\nFootnotes\n* Editor's note:The English version of this decision is longer than the French version. In the French version\nparagraphs 62 and 63 have been merged, as well as paragraphs 80 and 81\n1 The Republic of Sudan ratified the African Charter on 18th February 1986 and is consequently a State\nparty to the African Charter.\n2 According to the Islamic Banking System the \"rebeeh\" is an annual benefit on the principal fund. This\namount is multiplied by 120%.\n3 E/CN.4/2002/46 dated 23rd January 2002, Para. 19, 20 and 21\n×\n19. During the meetings held, a number of very serious concerns were expressed to the Special\nRapporteur, which left him under the impression that a credibility gap still remains to be bridged by the\nGovernment. More specifically, extremely serious concern was repeatedly expressed about the role of\nsecurity agents, who are invariably described as putting human rights and fundamental freedoms in\njeopardy.\n20. As he highlighted in paragraph 75 of his interim report, the Special Rapporteur finds it alarming that\nsecurity forces continued a campaign of harassment, intimidation and persecution, targeting political\nopponents and human rights defenders, by means of arbitrary arrests, followed by protracted, at times\nincommunicado, arbitrary detention without judicial review. Practices such as reporting, whereby an\nindividual is forced to report to the police on a regular basis, constitute an obvious form of harassment\n8\n\n\fwhich totally disrupts the daily life of the individual concerned.\n21. As for freedom of expression, the Special Rapporteur was informed that censorship had increased as of\nDecember 2000. It was reported that censorship is at times selective and discriminatory insofar as one\nnewspaper is sometimes prevented from publishing articles that other newspapers are allowed to print.\nFrom information gathered, it would seem that the National Press Council often failed to mount a significant\ndefence of freedom of expression. As a result of the generally held belief that no article is immune from\ncensorship, people's interest in newspapers has consistently decreased, to the point that most newspapers\nare facing financial difficulties.\npp. 6 and 7.\n4 E/CN.4/2003/42dated 6th January 2003' Para. 28\n× The state of emergency in force since December 1999 provided the basis for the imposition of security\nmeasures, often arbitrarily implemented. The Special Rapporteur has already referred to the amendment to\nthe National Security Forces Act, which virtually allows for incommunicado detention for periods of six to\nnine months, as well as the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Act of 1991 which strengthen the\npowers of law enforcement agents in matters relating to, inter alia, investigation, arrest, interrogation and\ndetention, without judicial review. Overall, the role of the security apparatus as the main entity responsible\nfor the human rights abuses as well as the impunity enjoyed by security officers remains an issue of serious\nconcern.\np.8.\n5 See paragraphs 432-455, pp 111-115.\n6 See Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, at p.111 at Para. 432\n× 432. The 1998 Constitution asserts the independence of the Judiciary. However, the Judiciary appears to\nhave been manipulated and politicised during the last decade. Judges disagreeing with the Government\noften suffered harassment including dismissals.\n7 See Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, at p 115 at Para. 455\n× 455. Based on the above, the Commission considers that in view of the impunity which reigns in Darfur\ntoday, the judicial system has demonstrated that it lacks adequate structures, authority, credibility, and\nwillingness to effectively prosecute and punish the perpetrators of the alleged crimes that continue to exist\nin Darfur.\n8 communications No. 48/90, 50/91, 52/91 and 89/93.\n9 Communication 284/2003\n10 Communication 65/92\n11 Article 15(1) (d) of the Constitutional Court Act\n12 communication 308/05- Michael Majuru/Zimbabwe and communication 43/90 Union des Scolaires\nNigeriens- Union Generale des Etudiants Nigeriens au Benin/Niger, where the Communication was\ndeclared inadmissible on the ground that none of the conditions relating to form, time limit or procedure laid\ndown under Article 56 and Rule 114 of the (Previous Version of the Rules of Procedure) were complied\nwith.\n13 Article [35\n× The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to\nthe generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which\nthe final decision was taken.\nof The European Convention on Human rights.\n14 Article 46(1) (b)\n× 1.

The Secretariat of the African Commission received the communication from the Complainant, Redmond\nTsatsu Tsikata, in accordance with Article 55 of the African Charter.\n2. The author of the present communication, who is himself the Complainant, submitted the communication\nagainst the Republic of Ghana ('Ghana')1 , alleging that the latter is in the process of trying him for \"wilfully\ncausing financial loss to the State\" contrary to Section 179A (3) of the Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29); an act,\nwhich did not constitute an offence at the time of the commission. He alleges that this is contrary to Article\n19(5)\n× A person shall not be charged with or held to be guilty of a criminal offence which is founded on an act or\nomission that did not at the time it took place constitute an offence.\n(http://www.parliament.gh/chapter_five_-_fundamental_human_right_and_freedoms.html Accessed\n18.10.2010)\nof the Constitution of Ghana, which prohibits retroactive criminalisation, and Article 7(2) of the African\nCharter. He had challenged this in the High Court in Ghana, and his contention was upheld.\n3. He further alleges that in the course of his trial, he has been denied the right to a fair trial, in violation of\nArticle 7(1) of the African Charter. He alleged that he had been summoned 'in the name of the President' to\nappear before a 'Fast-Track Court'; and he had challenged the constitutionality of both at the Supreme\nCourt, which claims were upheld on 28th February 2002. However, after the Executive's alleged\ninterference with the decision, and the 'questionable' appointment of a new Justice of the Supreme Court,\nthe decision was 'reversed' by an 11-member panel of the Supreme Court, including the newly-appointed\nJustice, on 26th June 2002. The case was further 'remitted' to the 'Fast-Track Court', which had now been\ndeclared constitutional.\n4. The author also notes that the Chief Justice had prior to the Supreme Court's latter decision, publicly and\nexplicitly stated his determination to have the earlier decision of the case reversed.\n5. The author also contends that both the manner of appointment of the new Justice of the Supreme Court\nand the conduct of the Executive towards the Judiciary in relation to his case constituted a violation of\nArticle 26 of the African Charter, which obliges states to guarantee the independence of the judiciary.\n6. The author stated that on 9th October 2002, he was again charged before the High Court of Accra on\nfour counts, including the retroactive charge of 'wilfully causing financial loss to the State' (para. 2 above);\nand intentionally misapplying public property contrary to section 1(2) of the Public Property Decree 1977,\n(SMCD 140). He alleges that the facts on which the charges were based are the same as those on which\nhe had been charged before three (3) previous courts: a) Circuit Tribunal; b) Fast Track Court; and c) the\nnormal High Court.\n7. The author further alleges a violation of his right to fair trial under Article 7(1) of the African Charter when\nthe trial judge of the High Court of Accra overruled his Counsel's submission of 'no-case-to-answer', without\ngiving reasons; thereby violating his right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court\nor tribunal, as well as right to have the violations of his fundamental rights redressed.\n8. He further alleges that he had appealed to the Court of Appeal, and that in upholding the decision of the\nlower court, the Court of Appeal had relied on a repealed law, which was neither cited in the charge sheet,\nnor at any point in the trial proceedings at the High Court, except in response to the submission of\n'no-case-to-answer'. He alleges that the Court of Appeal thereby denied him of his right to defence\nguaranteed under Article 7(1)(c) of the African Charter as he could not have known before the trial, that a\nrepealed law, which he had no (prior) notice of in the charge sheet or at any point in the trial, would be the\nbasis of his charge. He also alleges a further breach of his right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty\nby a competent court or tribunal guaranteed by Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\n9. He submits that there is a further violation of Article 7(2) of the African Charter, and a failure to enforce\nArticles 19(5)\n× A person shall not be charged with or held to be guilty of a criminal offence which is founded on an act or\nomission that did not at the time it took place constitute an offence.\n(http://www.parliament.gh/chapter_five_-_fundamental_human_right_and_freedoms.html Accessed\n18.10.2010)\n\n1\n\n\fand Article 11 of the Constitution of Ghana, which accord him certain fundamental rights as an accused\nperson.\n10. He contends that he was further denied the right to defence guaranteed under Article 7(1)(c) of the\nAfrican Charter when upon his subpoena, the counsel for the International Finance Commission (IFC)\nappeared before the Court and argued that the IFC was immune from the court's jurisdiction; and this\nargument was upheld, even by the Court of Appeal, despite the provision of Article 19(2)(g)\n× A person charged with a criminal offence shall:- be afforded facilities to examine, in person or by his\nlawyer, the witnesses called by the prosecution before the court, and to obtain the attendance and carry out\nthe examination of witnesses to testify on the same conditions as those applicable to witnesses called by\nthe prosecution. (http://www.parliament.gh/chapter_five_-_fundamental_human_right_and_freedoms.html\nAccessed 19.10.2010)\nof the Constitution of Ghana, which guarantees the accused's right to call witnesses, and the fact that the\nstatutory provisions on the IFC in Ghana do not grant them the claimed immunity from testifying.\n11. He noted that Article 19(2)(g)\n× A person charged with a criminal offence shall: - be afforded facilities to examine, in person or by his\nlawyer, the witnesses called by the prosecution before the court, and to obtain the attendance and carry out\nthe examination of witnesses to testify on the same conditions as those applicable to witnesses called by\nthe prosecution. (http://www.parliament.gh/chapter_five_-_fundamental_human_right_and_freedoms.html\nAccessed 19.10.2010)\nof the Constitution of Ghana is similar to the paragraph 2 (e)(iii)\n× Examine or have examined, the witnesses against them and to obtain the attendance and examination of\nwitnesses on their behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against them\nof the provisions of the Resolution on the Right to Recourse and Fair Trial of the African Commission on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights' meeting at its 11th Ordinary Session in Tunisia, 2nd to 9th May 1992.\n12. Lastly, he contended that the continuation of his trial on charges and in the manner that offend the\nprovisions of the African Charter would cause him irreparable damage.\n\nComplaint\n13. The author of this communication contends that the charge on which his trial is based constitutes a\nviolation of the right against non-retroactive criminalisation under Article 7(2) of the African Charter.\n14. He also contends that the manners in which the trial has been, and is being carried out violate Article\n7(1) of the African Charter.\n15. He seeks the intervention of the African Commission, and urges the [African] Commission to invoke\nRule 111 of its Rules of Procedure on provisional measures, and request the Republic of Ghana not to\nproceed further with his trial until his case has been heard by the African Commission.\n\nProcedure\n16. The present communication was received by the Secretariat of the African Commission on 27th April\n2006.\n17. The Secretariat of the [African] Commission acknowledged receipt of the communication to the\ncomplainant under letter ACHPR/LPROT/COMM/322/2006/RE of 2nd May 2006, providing the references of\nthe communication and informing the complainant that the communication would be scheduled for\nconsideration by the African Commission at its 39th Ordinary Session to be held in May 2006, in Banjul, The\nGambia.\n18. At its 39th Ordinary Session, held from 11th to 25th May 2006, in Banjul, The Gambia, the Commission\ndecided to be seized of the communication, but declined to request the Respondent State to take\nprovisional measures in accordance with Rule 111(1) of its Rules of Procedure because the Complainant\ndid not demonstrate the irreparable damage that would be caused if the provisional measures were not\ntaken.\n19. On 1st June 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties of the\nabove-mentioned decision and asked them to provide it with more information on the admissibility of the\ncommunication, in accordance with Article 56 of the African Charter. It also sent a copy of the\ncommunication to the Respondent State. It requested the parties to send their written observations to the\nSecretariat within three (3) months after notification of the decision.\n2\n\n\f20. On 31st August and 5th September 2006, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission received the\nsubmissions of the Respondent State by fax and mail, respectively.\n21. At its 40th Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th November 2006 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission considered this communication on admissibility.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\nThe Complainant's submission\n\n22. In the case under consideration, the Complainant makes reference to several recourses to the domestic\ncourts for redress of the alleged violations of his rights, but gives no indication of the exhaustion of all\navailable domestic remedies, particularly in view of the alleged on-going violation. From the facts\npresented, the alleged on-going violation of his rights involves an on-going trial, the legality of which he\nchallenges on the basis of the provisions of the Charter. He however failed to present evidence of the\nconclusion of this trial, and or to prove that it has been unduly prolonged.\n23. The Complainant contended that the continuation of his trial based on charges and in the manner that\noffend the provisions of the African Charter would cause him irreparable damage, but without elaborating\nhow.\nThe Respondent State's submission\n\n24. In its response in accordance with Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission, the\nRespondent State referred to the provisions of Article 56(5) of the African Charter which provides for the\nexhaustion of local remedies as a requirement for the African Commission to rule on the admissibility of\ncommunications, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged. It therefore submitted that\nsince the matter of the Complainant's communication is still pending in the High Court of Justice, Ghana,\nwith further unexplored rights of appeal to the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of Ghana, in accordance\nwith Articles 137\n× (1) The Court of Appeal shall have jurisdiction throughout Ghana to hear and determine, subject to the\nprovisions of this Constitution, appeals from a judgement, decree or order of the High Court and Regional\nTribunals and such other appellate jurisdiction as may be conferred on it by this Constitution or any other\nlaw. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, an appeal shall lie as of right from a judgement,\ndecree or order of the High Court and a Regional Tribunal to the Court of Appeal. (3) For the purposes of\nhearing and determining an appeal within its jurisdiction and the amendment, execution or the enforcement\nof a judgment or order made on any appeal, and, for the purposes of any other authority expressly or by\nnecessary implication given to the Court of Appeal by this Constitution or any other law, the Court of Appeal\nshall have all the powers, authority and jurisdiction vested in the court from which the appeal is brought.\nand 131\n× (1) An appeal shall lie from a judgement of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court- (a) as of right in a\ncivil or criminal cause or matter in respect of which an appeal has been brought to the Court of Appeal from\na judgment of the High Court or a Regional Tribunal in the exercise of its original jurisdiction; or (b) with the\nleave of the Court of Appeal, in any other cause or matter, where the case was commenced in a court\nlower than the High Court or a Regional Tribunal and where the Court of Appeal is satisfied that the case\ninvolves a substantial question of law or is in the public interest. (2) Notwithstanding clause (1) of this\narticle, the Supreme Court may entertain application for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in\nany cause or matter, civil or criminal, and may grant leave accordingly. (3) The Supreme Court shall have\nappellate jurisdiction, to the exclusion of the Court of Appeal, to determine matters relating to the conviction\nor otherwise of a person for high treason or treason by the High Court. (4) An appeal from a decision of the\nJudicial Committee of the National House of Chiefs shall lie to the Supreme Court with the leave of that\nJudicial Committee or the Supreme Court.\nrespectively of the Constitution of Ghana, the communication should be declared inadmissible by the\n[African] Commission.\n\n3\n\n\f25. The Respondent State also recalled that the guidelines for submission of communications provide that\neach communication should particularly indicate that local remedies have been exhausted, and observed\nthat the Complainant failed to provide any evidence of the domestic legal remedies pursued.\n26. The Respondent State also argued that the Complainant further failed to meet the requirement of\nArticle 56(5) of the [African] Charter as he could not show in his complaint that the procedure in the High\nCourt of Justice has been protracted or unduly delayed. It further submitted that if indeed any delay has\nbeen occasioned, it would be due to the Complainant's own repeated requests for adjournments and\ninterlocutory appeals.\n27. The Respondent State also made reference to Article 56(5) of the [African] Charter, which provides for\ncommunications to be submitted \"within a reasonable period from the time local remedies are\nexhausted...\", and submitted that the Complainant acted impetuously given that the matter has not been\nconcluded, and time has not begun to run so as to afford the Complainant an opportunity to bring his\ncomplaint.\n28. Furthermore, the Respondent State noted Article 56(3) of the [African] Charter and the guidelines for\nsubmission of communications which provide that a communication shall be considered \"if it is not written in\ndisparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned...\"; and submitted that the language\nin paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of the Complainant's communication is insulting to Ghana and its judiciary\nwhere lack of integrity, impropriety, bias and prejudice are imputed to the Executive and the Judiciary of the\nRepublic of Ghana. To this effect, the Respondent State cited the Complainant's statement in paragraph 17\nof his communication whereby he stated that: \"far from guaranteeing the independence of the court in\nrelation to my trial, the Government of Ghana has shown an irrevocable determination to have me found\nguilty by hook or crook and incarcerated\".\n\nThe Commission's Decision\n29. The admissibility of the communications submitted before the African Commission is governed by the\nseven conditions set out in Article 56 of the African Charter.\n30. The parties' submissions only relate to the provisions of Articles 56(3), 56(5) and 56(6).\n31. Article 56(3) specifically stipulates that communications shall be considered if they \"are not written in\ndisparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned and its institutions...\".\n32. In respect of the Respondent's State's submission that paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of the complaint is\nwritten in disparaging or insulting language directed against the former, the [African] Commission holds that\nthis is not the case. The [African] Commission notes that these stipulated paragraphs of the complaint are\nonly facts of allegations of Charter violations; and expressions of the Complainant's fear in this regard. It is\non the basis of these allegations and fear that the Complainant had submitted this communication. The\n[African] Commission reiterates that the purpose of its mandate is to consider complaints alleging such\nperceived judicial bias and prejudice, and undue interference by the executive with judicial independence,\nin accordance with Article 7 of the [African] Charter, its Resolution on the Respect and the Strengthening\non the Independence of the Judiciary (1996) 2 , and other relevant international human rights norms; in\naccordance with Articles 60, 61 of the [African] Charter.\n33. In this light, the [African] Commission wishes to distinguish these paragraphs, for instance, from its\ndecision in the case of communication 65/92 Ligue Camerounaise des Droits de l'Homme/Cameroon,\nwhere the [African] Commission condemned the use of words such as \"Paul Biya must resond [sic] to\ncrimes against humanity\"; \"30 years of the criminal neo-colonial regime incarnated by the duo Ahidjio/Biya\";\n\"regime of torturers\"; and \"government barbarisms\", as insulting language.\n34. In respect of Article 56(5) which stipulates that communications shall be considered if they \"are sent\nafter exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged...\", the\n[African] Commission notes the importance of this rule as a condition for the admissibility of a claim before\nan international forum. It notes that the rule is based on the premise that the Respondent State must first\nhave an opportunity to redress by its own means and within the framework of its own domestic legal\nsystem, the wrong alleged to have been done to the individual.\n35. In light of the parties' submissions, the African Commission notes that the complainant's allegations are\nin respect of an on-going/unconcluded trial. The information provided by the complainant himself states that\nthe communication [sic] is still pending before the courts of the Republic of Ghana. The [African]\nCommission further notes that should the on-going trial end against the Complainant's favour, he has\nfurther rights of appeal to the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of Ghana, in accordance with Articles\n4\n\n\f137 and 131 respectively of the Constitution of Ghana. In this regard, the [African] Commission draws the\nattention of the parties to the similar case of communication 135/94 Kenya Human Rights Commission /\nKenya, where it had held that \"...the facts supplied by the Complainants themselves stated that the\ncommunication was pending before the Courts of Kenya,... [and] that the Complainants had therefore not\nexhausted all available local remedies\".\n36. Therefore, although the communication presents a prima facie case of a series of violations of the\nAfrican Charter, a close look at the file and the submissions indicate that the complainant is yet to exhaust\nall the local remedies available to him.\n37. With regard to Article 56(6) of the [African] Charter which provides that communications shall be\nconsidered if \"... they are submitted within a reasonable period of time from the time local remedies are\nexhausted, or from the date the Commission is seized of the matter\", the [African] Commission holds that\nthis is quite related to the principle of the exhaustion of local remedies in accordance with Article 56(5). This\nmeans that the Commission estimates the timeliness of a communication from the date that the last\navailable local remedy is exhausted by the Complainant. In the case of unavailability or prolongation of\nlocal remedies, it will be from the date of the Complainant's notice thereof.\n38. Unlike its Inter-American3 contemporary, the Commission does not specify a time-period within which\ncommunications must be submitted. However, it advised on the early submission of communications in the\ncase of communication 97/93 John K. Modise/Botswana.\n39. However, having found that the Complainant has not exhausted local remedies the [African]\nCommission concurs with the Respondent State's argument that the Complainant had acted impetuously in\nbringing this communication. This is because the matter has not been concluded, for which reason time has\nnot begun to run such as to afford the Complainant the opportunity to bring this complaint.\n\nHolding\n\nFor these reasons, the African Commission, Declares the communication inadmissible for\nnon-exhaustion of local remedies.\nDone at the 40th Ordinary Session held from in Banjul, The Gambia, 15th to 29th November 2006.\n\nFootnotes\n1 Ghana ratified the African Charter on 24th January 1989, and is thus a State Party.\n2 ACHPR /Res. 21(XIX) 96.\n3 Article 32\n× Article 32.

The Complaint is brought by the Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda - FLEC (the\nComplainant) on behalf of the people of Cabinda (Victims) against the Republic of Angola1 (the\nRespondent State or Angola).\n2. The Complainant submits that Cabinda, formerly known as the Portuguese Congo, consists of a territory\nof approximately 2800 square miles. The Complainant further submits that in 1885 the independent rulers\nof Cabinda city and its environs entered into a treaty, the Treaty of Simulambuco, with the Government of\nthe Kingdom of Portugal establishing a Protectorate over much of present day Cabinda.\n3. In 1975, the Complainant alleges, the Alvor Conference in Portugal, between the colonial power and\nUNITA, MPLA, and FNLA (all of which were liberation movements) declared the annexation of Cabinda by\nAngola without any Cabindan participation. Following this event, Angola has exercised sovereignty over\nCabinda despite protestations by the people of Cabinda, through groups dedicated to the idea of a distinct\nidentity for the people of Cabinda.\n4. The Complainant alleges that since 2002, following attempts by groups in Cabinda to stake a claim to\nautonomy for the people of Cabinda, the Respondent State has undertaken a massive military campaign\nagainst Cabinda and that when this failed, the state entered into ad hoc negotiations with Cabindan factions\nin an attempt to confuse issues. These negotiations, the Complainant alleges, excluded the Chairman of\nFLEC, Mr. Nzita Tiago - \"the only universally recognized Cabindan authority\" - and resulted in a 2006\nPeace Accord that was contested by both Cabinda and the democratic opposition in Angola, the UNITA.\n5. The Complainant further alleges that following the rejection of the 2006 Peace Accord by the majority of\nCabindans, fractions in Cabinda continued to demand local autonomy over the wealth of Cabinda. The\nComplainant states that the Respondent State has responded to the demands by maintaining a large\nmilitary force in Cabinda, which has committed numerous documented human rights violations therein.2\n6. The Complainant claims that in 2006 the Angolan Forces (FAA) committed dozens of human rights and\nhumanitarian violations such as: the bombardment of civilian dwellings in the Mayombe (Piading) region;\nsummary execution of Cabinda patriots in Buco, Zao and beatings and torture of Mpalabanda members in\nCaio Poba.\n7. It is the Complainant further claim that in July 2006 Angola banned the only independent human rights\norganization in Cabinda, Mpalabnda (Associacao Civica de Cabinda) through the instrumentality of a court\norder, allegedly for inciting violence and hatred, and carrying out political activities rather than being a civil\nsociety organization.\n8. Furthermore, the Complainant avers, Government of the Respondent State is exercising economic\nexploitation of Cabindan resources since the people of Cabinda are not allowed to have any say in the\ngrant of licences and concessions over their resources. The Complainant claims that the people of Cabinda\nhave been suffering comparatively higher unemployment, lack of educational opportunities, disease and\nintense poverty since the Government of the Respondent State took over Cabinda's natural resources such\nas offshore oil, onshore mineral and oil resources.\n9. The Complainant further alleges that the Government of the Respondent State has economically\ndominated the Cabindan people by denying them their status as a people and by extracting more than\nninety per cent (90%) of their economic patrimony while returning less than ten per cent (10%) to Cabinda.\nBy this act, the Complainant alleges, the Respondent State has perpetrated neo-colonialism.\n10. The Complainant also contends that although Cabindans are culturally and linguistically separate from\nAngola and have overwhelmingly identified themselves as 'Cabindans', not Angolans, the people of\nCabinda have been denied their right to self-determination by Angola.\n11. The Complainant submits that despite over 30 years of conflict over the status of Cabinda, the\nRespondent State has refused to hold a referendum on the issue of Cabindan question. The Complainant\nalleges that the Respondent State does not permit Cabinda to determine its own economic and social\ndevelopment. The Complainant states that all economic decisions are made in Luanda, the capital city of\nthe Respondent State and not in Cabinda, even though Cabinda has maintained a government in exile\nsince 1963 and has had an active self-defence force and civil administration inside Cabinda since 1975.\n1\n\n\fArticles alleged to have been violated\n12. The Complainant alleges that in relation to the people of Cabinda, the Respondent State has violated\nArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter.\nPrayers of the Complainant\n13. The Complainant requests the African Commission on Human and Peoples Right (African Commission\nor Commission):\n1. To appoint a Special Rapporteur to undertake fact finding and make recommendations on the\nissues it has raised.\n2. Make its good offices available for further engagement on the issues raised\n3. Award $US 50000 against the Respondent State to cover the Complainant's legal fees and costs.\n\nProcedure\n14. This Communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on Human and\nPeoples' Rights (the Secretariat) on 29 September 2006. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt by letter\ndated 2 October 2006, informing the Complainant that the Communication would be scheduled for\nconsideration on seizure by the African Commission at its 40th Ordinary Session held in November 2006 in\nBanjul, The Gambia.\n15. At its 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission decided to be seized of the Communication.\n16. On 8 January 2007, the African Commission further received a press statement issued by FLEC on the\ncurrent struggle for the control of petroleum in Cabinda, alleging continuous violations of the African\nCharter by the Angolan Government and other actors for which the State is responsible.\n17. By a letter dated 8 February 2007 and Note Verbale dated 28 February 2007, the Secretariat informed\nthe Parties of the Commission's decision on seizure and requested the Parties to submit their arguments on\nthe Admissibility of the Communication within two months. A copy of the Complaint was also transmitted to\nthe Respondent State.\n18. On 25 April 2007, the Secretariat sent reminders to the Parties to submit their arguments on\nAdmissibility by 10 May 2007 in time for the 41st Session of the African Commission. At its 41st Ordinary\nSession in May 2007 in Accra, Ghana, the Commission considered the Communication and deferred it\npending the receipt of Arguments on Admissibility from the Parties. The Parties were notified accordingly\non 20 June 2007.\n19. On 15 August 2007, the Complainant's brief with its Arguments on Admissibility and an updated\nstatement of facts was received at the Secretariat. These were transmitted along with a Note Verbale to the\nRespondent State on 20 August 2007 together with a request for the latter to submit its response to the\nComplainant's submission on Admissibility.\n20. During its 42nd Ordinary Session in November 2007, the African Commission considered the\nCommunication and decided to give the Respondent State one last chance to make its submissions on the\nAdmissibility of the Communication. The Parties were notified accordingly on 19 December 2007.\n21. During its 43rd and 44th Ordinary Sessions, the African Commission deferred the consideration of the\nCommunication pending the submission on Admissibility by the Respondent State, the parties were\naccordingly informed.\n22. On 27 April 2009 the Secretariat sent a reminder to the Respondent State to make its submissions on\nAdmissibility.\n23. On 21 July 2009, the African Commission received supplementary information to the Communication by\nthe Complainant.\n24. During its 45th and 46th Ordinary Sessions respectively, the African Commission considered the\nCommunication and deferred its decision on Admissibility pending the Respondent State's submission on\nAdmissibility\n2\n\n\f25. On 12 January 2010, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant urging the African\nCommission to take immediate action and to appoint a Special Rapporteur for Cabinda.\n26. During its 47th, 48th, 49th and 50th Ordinary Sessions, the African Commission deferred the\nconsideration of the Communication, and the Parties were accordingly informed. At its 10th Extraordinary\nSession held in December 2011, the Commission considered the Communication and declared it\nAdmissible. The Parties were accordingly informed and invited to submit their Arguments on the Merit.\n27. Between January and March 2012, the Secretariat received submissions from three different\norganisations representing different groups in Cabinda (joint submission by the Front de Liberation de\nL'Etat du Cabinda (FLEC) et Union Nationale de Liberation du Cabinda (UNLC), and individual submissions\nby the \"Original FLEC\" and the Mouvement Pour Le Rassemblement Du Peuple Cabindais et Pour Sa\nSouverainete \"MRPCS). On 29 March 2012, the Secretariat received a Submission on the Merit from Dr\nJonathan Levy acting in his capacity as legal representative of the Complainant.3 The Complainant's\nSubmission on the Merit was accordingly transmitted to the Respondent State.\n28. On 24 April 2012, the Respondent State's Note Verbale forwarding the latter's Arguments on the Merit\nwas received at the Secretariat and transmitted to Complainant through its legal representative.\n29. On 12 July 2012, the Complainant through its legal representative forwarded its Supplementary\nSubmission on the Merit. On 10, 12 and 28 September 2012, the Secretariat received the same copy of an\nupdated and amended Submission on the Merit from the Respondent State.\n30. On 18 June 2013, the Secretariat received additional Submissions from the \"Collectif des organisations\ncabindaises\" also known as the \"Original FLEC\". This submission was followed by a letter protesting\nnotification that the submission has been made out of time and a request for reopening of the procedure for\nsubmission of additional documents by both parties.\n31. At its 54th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia in October 2013, the Commission considered\nthe Communication on the Merit based on all the documents submitted by the Parties and the various\nAmicus briefs.\n\nThe Law\nAdmissibility\nSubmission of the Complainant on Admissibility\n\n32. Although the Complainant submitted its written arguments on the admissibility of the Communication,\nthe Respondent State failed to submit any arguments on the admissibility of the Communication despite an\ninvitation and repeated reminders to do so. Accordingly, the Commission addresses the question of\nAdmissibility on the basis of the Complainant's arguments on Admissibility.\n33. The Complainant submits that the Communication meets all the Admissibility requirements set out in\nArticle 56 of the African Charter. Regarding Article 56 (1) of the African Charter, the Complainant avers that\nthe Communication is submitted by FLEC on behalf of the people of Cabinda.\n34. Concerning Article 56 (2) of Charter, the Complainant submits that the Respondent State has violated\nArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter. The Complainant further submits that although the\nCommunication alleges serious violations of the economic and peoples\" rights of the people of Cabinda by\nthe Government of Angola, the Complainant does not request the African Commission to take up any\nmatter that would interfere with the sovereignty of Angola or adjudication of Angolan territorial claims in\nCabinda. The Complainant states that they are mindful that the African Commission must respect Articles\n3(b) and 4(b) of the AU Constitutive Act regarding territorial sovereignty and respecting existing borders.\n35. With regards to Article 56 (3) of the African Charter, the Complainant avers that the language used in\nthe Communication is neutral legal language. In relation to Article 56 (4) of the African Charter, the\nComplainant submits that the Communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated through the\nmass media, but rather on primary information provided by FLEC and other organizations directly involved\nin the matter.\n36. On the requirement of the exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56 (5) of the African Charter, the\nComplainant requests the Commission to wave this condition on the basis that exhaustion of domestic\nremedies is futile and legally impossible on the grounds that there is unrest and armed conflict involving the\nParties and this creates difficulties for the commencement of legal proceedings by the Complainant. The\nComplainant avers further that the only independent civil society organisation which could have brought a\n3\n\n\flegal action on behalf of the Complainant has been disbanded and banned by judicial order instigated by\nthe Respondent State. It is also the Complainant's submission that it cannot pursue legal action in the\nRespondent State because it (the Complainant) has been branded a terrorist organisation since the signing\nof a 2006 Peace Accord between the Respondent States and elements in Cabinda.\n37. As to Article 56 (6) of the African Charter, the Complainants aver that the Communication has been\nsubmitted in a timely manner. Lastly, the Complainant submits that the Communication complies with the\nrequirement of Article 56 (7) of the African Charter because the Communication does not deal with a case\nwhich has been settled by the Respondent State.\nThe Commission's Analysis on Admissibility\n\n38. Article 56 of the African Charter lists seven Admissibility requirements that have to be cumulatively\nfulfilled for a Communication to be declared Admissible. In the present Communication, while the\nComplainant has clearly stated its arguments as to why the Communication meets each of the seven\nrequirements stipulated under Article 56, the Respondent State has not made any submission to contest or\nrefute those claims.\n39. From the time when the African Commission was seized with the Communication during its 40th\nOrdinary Session in November 2006 to date, ten (10) reminders were sent to the Respondent State\nrequesting the latter to submit its arguments on Admissibility to no avail.4\n40. As the African Commission has stated in the case of the Institute for Human Rights and Development in\nAfrica v. Republic of Angola5 \"in the face of the state's failure to address itself to the complaint filed against\nit, the African Commission has no option but to proceed with its consideration of the Communication in\naccordance with its Rules of Procedure.\" In the same decision, the African Commission re-affirmed its\nposition by ruling that \"... it would proceed to consider Communications on the basis of the submission of\nthe Complainants and information at its disposal, even if the State fails to submit.\"6\n41. In the case at hand, the Complainant submits that the Communication complies with all the seven\nrequirements of Article 56 of the African Charter, except the one relating to the exhaustion of local\nremedies under Article 56 (5), for which the Complainant asks for waiver.\n42. In the absence of any submissions from the Respondent State to the contrary, the African Commission\nhas considered the Complainant's Submission and is convinced that all the requirements under Article 56,\nexcept Article 56(5) are met. The Commission proceeds to consider the legitimacy of the request for waiver\nbased on Article 56(5) of the Charter and relevant jurisprudence.\n43. Article 56(5) of the African Charter provides that Communications should be \"sent after exhausting local\nremedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged\". This requirement is based on\nthe principle that \"the respondent state must first have an opportunity to redress by its own means within\nthe framework of its own domestic legal system, the wrong alleged to have been done to the individual\".7\n44. The Commission has stressed that the requirement of the exhaustion of local remedies \"does not mean\nthat complainants are required to exhaust any local remedy which is found to be, as a practical matter,\nunavailable or ineffective.\"8 The jurisprudence of the Commission, in determining compliance with this\nrequirement, sets out \"[t]hree major criteria, that is: the local remedy must be available, effective and\nsufficient.\"9\n45. The initial burden is on the Complainant to prove that they have met the requirement set in Article 56\n(5) or that those remedies are unavailable in the particular case. Thereafter, the burden shifts to the\nRespondent State if it contests the allegations of the former.\n46. In the present case, the Complainant avers that it has no legal standing under Angolan law and its\nrepresentatives would face arrest and possible execution under Angolan national security laws if they try to\npursue legal remedies in Angola, adding that members of FLEC are considered terrorists in Angolan\nterritory and hence any attempt to take the case before Angolan courts would be futile, if not impossible,\nand would subject members of the Complainant organisation to arbitrary arrest, detention or execution as\nterrorists.\n47. The Complainant also submits that the only independent human rights organisation in Cabinda,\nMpalabanda, that could have taken their case before a court of law was banned on 20 July 2006 for\nallegedly inciting violence and hatred, and being involved in political activities. Furthermore, the\nComplainant argues that the principal members of FLEC (the Complainant) are outside Angolan\njurisdiction, thus they request for the waiver of the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies.\n48. These claims, which are not contested by the Respondent State, show the apparent existence of fear of\n4\n\n\fpersecution on the part of the Complainant.\n49. In a number of cases the African Commission has used the standard of constructive exhaustion of local\nremedies to provide an exception to the rule. Fear of persecution is one of the exceptions to the\nrequirement of exhaustion of local remedies. In Sir Dawda K Jawara v The Gambia10 the African\nCommission reasoned that \"the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but\nalso in practice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Therefore, if the\napplicant cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of generalised fear for his life (or even those of\nhis relatives), local remedies would be considered to be unavailable to him\".\n50. In Rights International v Nigeria11 and John D Ouoko v Kenya12 , the African Commission reasoned that\nthe existence of apparent fear of persecution on the part of the victims, to return to their countries to\nexhaust local remedies would make the remedies not available to such persons and hence exempt them\nfrom the requirement to exhaust those remedies.\n51. In the present Communication, the fact that the Complainant has no legal standing before Angolan\ncourts, that most of its members live abroad and are considered terrorists by the Government, leads to the\nconclusion that the chances of the Complainant exhausting local remedies have been practically rendered\nimpossible by fear of prosecution.\n52. Therefore, the African Commission holds that local remedies were not available to the Complainant and\nhence rules that the Communication is in line with the requirement under Article 56(5) of the African\nCharter.\n53. For the above reasons, the African Commission declares the Communication admissible in accordance\nwith Article 56 of the African Charter.\nConsideration of the Merits\nSummary of Complaint's Submission\n\n54. The Complainant emphasises that the present Communication concerns itself strictly with a claim for\neconomic self-determination of the people of Cabinda and in particular with the disposition and exploitation\nof onshore oil, mineral and natural resources.\n55. The Complainant states further that the Communication excludes the matter of offshore resource\nallocation and relates only to the extraction of onshore resources which has remained dormant due largely\nto FLEC's armed opposition to any such exploitation. The Complainant contends that it does not recognise\ngrants of resource extraction licences and concessions made by the Respondent State and asserts that it\nreserves the right to make its own arrangements with resource extraction companies upon the\n\"decolonisation\" of Cabinda.\n56. Based on its contention that it has been recognised as the legitimate representative of the Cabinda\npeople since 1974, the Complainant requests that the Commission to appoint a Special Rapporteur on the\nissue of Cabinda's economic self-determination on the grounds that the Respondent State has violated\nArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter.\n57. The Complainant argues that as an incident of the right to property under Article 14 of the African\nCharter, the natural resources of Cabinda remain the property of the people of Cabinda and must be\nadministered largely for the benefit of the people of Cabinda. Accordingly, the grant of licences and\nconcession for the extraction of onshore natural resources by the Respondent State is a violation of Article\n14 of the African Charter.\n58. It is the further contention of the Complainant that although a state can grant resource extraction rights\nin the name of its people, a grant made in cases where one people dominate another or a grant made or\nadministered in an irresponsible manner would be illegitimate. The Complainant argues that historically,\nCabinda has always maintained a separate identity, linguistically and otherwise, and the people of Cabinda\nwere neither consulted on the 'unilateral termination of Portuguese colonial protectorate' nor did they ratify\n'the Angolan occupation' of Cabinda.\n59. The Complainant states that since 1974 it has 'maintained a civil government inside portions of\nCabinda' and many of the areas of resource extraction 'are in or near the FLEC zone'. Further, that since\nthe people of Cabinda are distinct, the Respondent State is not entitled to unilaterally grant resource\nextraction licences or concessions in violation of the right to property of the people of Cabinda as contained\nin Article 14 of the African Charter.\n60. In relation to the alleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter, the Complainant contends that\n5\n\n\f'revenue from onshore resource extraction will flow to Luanda just as offshore revenue does now'. The\nComplainant argues that a 2006 Cabinda Peace Accord which promised a 50% return of oil revenue to\nCabinda 'has not been realised or audited' and only '10% or less will return to Cabinda'. The Complainant\nalleges further that any attempt to question the allocation of revenue has resulted in summary\nimprisonment 'as in the case of Global Witness Investigatory' staff who was arrested and charged by\nAngolan Police after meeting with local representatives of civil society in Cabinda.\n61. The Complainant alleges further that in spite of the abundant oil resources in Cabinda unemployment is\nhigh and poverty, infant mortality and disease are higher in Cabinda than in most areas of Angola. The\nComplainant adds that Cabinda's resources have 'subsidised the government of Angola' and the 'Angolan\nadministration has little concern for providing public goods and incentives to facilitate investment in welfare\nenhancing improvements for the population at large'. Thus, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent\nState has violated Article 19 of the African Charter.\n62. Regarding the alleged violation of Article 20 of the Charter, the Complainant emphasises that the\npeople of Cabinda are geographically, politically, linguistically and culturally distinct from Angolans so that\nthey are have a right to social and economic development. The Complainant contends that the people of\nCabinda are unable to exercise this right because organisations which 'espouse a uniquely Cabindan point\nof view' have been banned by the government of Angola. Complainant alleges further that Cabindans who\ncampaign for economic self-determination are routinely arrested as 'FLEC sympathisers' while foreigners\nwho have identified corruption in Cabinda have been sent to jail. Accordingly the Complainant claims that\nthe Respondent State has violated Article 20 of the African Charter.\n63. On Article 21 of the African Charter, the Complainant contends that grants and concessions (what it\nterms onshore oil and mineral rights offerings) have been made by the Respondent State 'without input\nfrom the Cabindans' and that all decisions regarding natural resources are made from Luanda, the Capital\nof Angola. The Complainant contends that the Cabinda people and FLEC as the representative of the\nCabinda people have not been adequately consulted about the management of 'their onshore resources.\nRather, exploration and exploitation activities have been undertaken under the watch of the Angolan Armed\nForces. Thus, the Complainant disputes the legal right of the Respondent State to exploit and dispose\nonshore resources in Cabinda and alleges that such activities amount to spoliation which is in violation of\nArticle 21 of the African Charter and therefore should be redressed by the Respondent State.\n64. On the alleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter, the Complainant asserts that the people of\nCabinda are a distinct people with a right to economic and social development and contends that the\ncurrent policy of the Respondent State is one of 'Angolanisation of Cabinda' involving discriminating against\nand arresting individuals and groups that claim a Cabindan identity. Accordingly, the Complainant alleges\nthat the Respondent State has violated Article 22 of the African Charter.\n65. Regarding Article 24 of the African Charter, the Complainant alleges that the environment in Cabinda is\nnot conducive for the development of the people of Cabinda. While it claims it does not seek an ideal\nenvironment, the Complainant argues that it seeks an environment that permits 'some measure of equity for\nthe people of Cabinda'. The Complainant contends that the operations of companies such as Chevron take\nplace in conditions that harm human health and the environment because the Respondent State has failed\nto enforce compliance with environmental rules.\n66. The Complainant alleges further that the absence of viable civil society in Cabinda following the ban on\nthe Mpalabanda organisation ensures that the activities of oil companies are not monitored and no\ncompensation is paid in the event of damage to the environment. The Complainant therefore argues that\nthe Respondent State has violated the right of the people of Cabinda to a satisfactory environment as\nguaranteed in Article 24 of the African Charter.\n67. In support of all its allegations, the Complaint has submitted five documents as exhibits. They include a\n\"Republic of Kabinda January 8 2010 Committee Report on the Togolese Incident\"; a 1974 joint\ncommuniqué between Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola MPLA) and the Complainant (FLEC);\na Human Rights Watch report titled \"They Put me in the Hole - Military Detention, Torture and Lack of Due\nProcess in Cabinda\"; a 2008 Chevron Alternative Annual Report titled \"Chevron in Angola\" and an Amnesty\nInternational Public Statement titled \"Angola: Human rights organization banned\". Also submitted in support\nof the Complainant's case are historical accounts presented by different bodies acting on behalf of the\npeoples of Cabinda.\n\n6\n\n\fSummary of Respondent State's Submission\n\n68. In its submission on the merits, the Respondent State argues first that the Communication should not\nhave been declared admissible because that it failed to meet the requirements for admissibility as set out in\nthe African Charter. The Respondent State argues that Article 57 of the African Charter requires that prior\nto the consideration of a Communication on the merit, the Chairperson of the Commission ought to present\nthe Complaint before the Respondent State, setting out procedural matters and indicating whether the\nComplaint conforms to the provisions of the African Charter and other African Union (AU) instruments\nrelevant to the matter. The Respondent State contends that this requirement had not been met with respect\nto the present Communication.\n69. The Respondent State argues further that the Communication is not admissible for failure to comply\nwith the requirements of Articles 50 and 56(5) of the African Charter regarding exhaustion of local\nremedies. The Respondent State also alleges that the Commission failed to comply with Rule 6 (3) of its\nown Rules of Procedure which prohibits \"unrecognised National Liberation Movements from submitting\nmatters for inclusion in the agenda of sessions of the Commission\". The Respondent State insists that the\nComplainant is not qualified to submit this Communication to the African Commission's Session as it is\nneither a State Party nor a party entitled to bring \"Other Communications\" before the Commission.\n70. Citing Articles 3(b)13 and 4(b)14 of the AU Constitutive Act, the Respondent State argues that the\npresent Communication cannot proceed as it challenges the existing borders of an AU Member State and\nthreatens the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Respondent State.\n71. With respect to the merits of the Communication, the Respondent State supplied its version of the\nhistory of Angola emphasising that both the Alvor Accord of 1975 and the Constitution of Angola endow it\nwith sovereignty over the territory now known as Angola, including the Province of Cabinda. The\nRespondent State argues therefore that the right to self-determination has been exercised by the collective\n\"peoples\" of Angola and does not avail minorities and ethnic groups because it can only be available to\nstates emerging from colonial boundaries in recognition of the principle of \"uti possidetis juris\".\n72. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 14 of the African Charter, the Respondent State contends\nthat the right to property is also enshrined in Articles 14 and 37 of its own Constitution. The Respondent\nState argues that the right to property in its Constitution is guaranteed in the interest of individuals,\ncorporate bodies and local communities which \"implies all the people of Angola\"\n73. The Respondent State argues further that the Complainant has not demonstrated that the government\nof Angola does not manage the resources of Cabinda for the benefit of the people of Cabinda. The\nRespondent State avers that the government administers all its natural resources in an equitable and\nbalanced manner as a common asset for the economic, social and cultural development of the country and\nin the national interest.\n74. The Respondent State insists that the government of the Province of Cabinda receives a share of the\nAngolan State General Budget just like every other provincial government in Angola. Further, that by Article\n7 of the Angolan State General Budget Act (no 26/10) the Provinces of Cabinda and Zaire receive amounts\nequal to 10 percent of earnings from petroleum resources in addition to other expenditures and costs for\nthe construction of schools, roads, bridges, harbours, hospitals and other socio-economic infrastructure.\nThus, the Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 14 of the African Charter since its\naffairs are run \"in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws\".\n75. As regards the alleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that\nArticle 21 of its own Constitution provides for the principle of equality and that principle is implemented in all\nits 18 provinces. The Respondent State argues that as a result of its domestic constitutional obligation it\n\"cannot implement measures aimed at developing the country based on the premise that revenue should\nbe spent only in areas where it is generated\". The Respondent State cites the example of its on-going\n\"Strategy to Fight Poverty\" which aims to achieve a \"50% reduction by 2015 in the number of people with\nless than USD1.00 per day\".\n76. The Respondent State insists further that as compared to other provinces, the Province of Cabinda\nenjoys a special status in view of its contribution towards the Angolan State General Budget. The\nRespondent State also asserts that as contained in recent United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) and United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reports, there is an overall improvement\nin areas such as child health care and health care generally. Accordingly, the Respondent State contends,\nit has not violated Article 19 of the African Charter as it relates to the Province of Cabinda.\n77. As regards the alleged violation of Article 20 of the African Charter, the Respondent State contends that\n7\n\n\fthe right has collectively been fulfilled by all the Angolan people through the attainment of independence on\n11 November 1975 and by the conduct of free democratic elections in 1992 and 2008 respectively. The\nRespondent State asserts that according to available records a total of 7, 213, 281 voters representing\n87.36% of the population of Angola went to the polls in the 2008 Legislative elections in Angola. Out of the\n220 deputies elected in the 2008 Legislative elections, 5 came from Cabinda as representatives of the\nCabinda Province. Accordingly, the Respondent State argues that the people of Cabinda are represented\nin the National Assembly of the Republic of Angola by those deputies. In support of these assertions, the\nRespondent State attaches reports of the 2008 and 2012 elections as released by its National Electoral\nCommission.\n78. Accordingly, the Respondent State contends that as with other of its provinces, the Province of Cabinda\nhas its own political and administrative structures which are defined by law. The Respondent State argues\nthat \"like most African peoples, Angola is a multicultural and multilingual society\" and Article 87 of its\nConstitution guarantees the right to respect, appreciation and preservation of the cultural, linguistic and\nartistic identity of the Angolan people. As such, the Respondent State concludes that it has not violated\nArticle 20 of the African Charter.\n79. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 21 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that\nArticles 94 and 95 of its own Constitution create and separate public and private domains of property rights.\nIt asserts that natural resources fall under the public domain and property in the public domain is\nconstitutionally intended to \"serve national interests instead of local interests alone\" since it is expected to\n\"benefit the Angolan people as a whole, with no exception\". The Respondent State points out that the\nComplainant itself agrees that some percentage of oil revenue is already set aside specially for the\nProvince of Cabinda.\n80. The Respondent State contends further that Angola operates a unitary system of government in which\nall provinces are on equal footing such that all public resources should serve the entire population of the\nstate but it was in spite of this fact that the Province of Cabinda has been given special attention as a result\nof its contribution to national oil production.\n81. The Respondent State challenges the Complainant's claim that it (FLEC) is Cabinda's representative\nand argues that the Complainant \"lacks moral, legal and any other form of legitimacy\" therefore it cannot\nspeak on behalf of the people of Cabinda. The Respondent State insists that as a sovereign state, Angola\nhas the legitimacy and the right to explore the natural resources in its territory, including those found in any\nof its 18 provinces. Thus, it argues that it has not violated Article 21 of the African Charter.\n82. In relation to the alleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter, the Respondent State argues that\nthe Complainant has failed to produce any evidence to sustain a claim that the rights of the people of\nCabinda have been violated. The Respondent State asserts that since Cabinda is part of a single,\nindivisible and inalienable territory (Angola) it finds no reason or basis to defend a claim that Cabinda is\nbeing \"Angolanised\".\n83. The Respondent State contends that its citizens are Angolans by origin both according to its domestic\nlaw and in international law. It being the case, that there is no such thing as the State of Cabinda in Africa\nbut a Cabinda that is a province \"which is an integral part of the Angolan State\", the Respondent State\nargues that it retains a right to punish by law, \"every deed, action or attempt to divide the Angolan State\".\nThe Respondent State therefore argues that it has not violated Article 22 of the African Charter.\n84. On the alleged violation of Article 24 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that it takes\nthe characteristics of Cabinda's oil fields and forests into account and has taken measures with a view to\npreserving the environment. The Respondent State cites the enactment of legislation at national and local\nlevels based on an entrenched right to a healthy and unpolluted environment in Article 39 of its\nConstitution. The Respondent State contends further that it has a Basic Environment Act in addition to a\nnumber of other statutes and institutions such as a Multi-Sector Technical Commission and the National\nEnvironment Authority which address the issues arising from oil exploration.\n85. The Respondent State claims further that by a Presidential Decree of 2011, oil companies are required\nto account for any harm stemming from oil spills, while paying greater attention to fishermen and their\nfamilies. The Respondent State admits that there have been oil spills in the Province of Cabinda but that its\nMinistry of Environment's National Environment Surveillance Service has kept track of at least six of these\nspills, compelling oil companies to compensate fishermen and to replace items that had been lost or\ndamaged.\n86. The Respondent State asserts further that it has legislation which compels concessionaires and their\nassociates to take preventive and practical measures to address environmental damage. Such measures\n8\n\n\finclude the generation of evaluation studies and environment impact audits, landscape and structural\nreplenishment plans and standing contract mechanisms for environmental management and auditing.\n87. The Respondent State submits that following an accident in the Gulf of Mexico, its Ministry of\nEnvironment has audited oil rigs in the Angolan sea \"with a view to preventing a repetition of what\nhappened in ... the Western Hemisphere\". It also claims that its Ministry of Environment has \"been holding\npublic consultation on environment impact evaluation in the Cabinda South Block in terms of Decree No\n51\". The Respondent State contends that these measures are not restricted to the oil sector but are\nextended to other resources. Thus, it argues that it has not violated Article 24 of the African Charter.\n88. In proof of its assertion, the Respondent State attached the results of its 2008 and 2012 Legislative\nelections result but no other documents apart from a \"Memorandum of Understanding and Integration of\nFLEC Members\" which states that the Respondent State has spent huge sums of money to register and\ndemobilise former FLEC soldiers. The Respondent State concludes by insisting that the Communication\nshould be considered inadmissible \"for lacking a legal basis and probable cause\".\nComplainant's Supplementary Submission\n\n89. In its supplementary submission in reply to the Respondent State's arguments on the merit, the\nComplainant reaffirmed and expanded on its version of the history of Cabinda in order to show that the\nterritory of Cabinda was historically administered separately from mainland Angola and had a people with\ndistinct linguistic, cultural and political identity.\nAmicus Submissions\n\n90. Between January and March 2012 and again in June 2013, a number of submissions were made by a\nnumber of organisations representing different interests of the Cabinda people. With the consent of the\nlegal representative of the Complainant, those submissions are considered as amicus briefs. In all their\nsubmissions, the different groups advance the Complainant's version of historical facts and insist that the\npeople of Cabinda are victims of unlawful, aggressive and unilateral invasion by the government of the\nRespondent State. The groups submit that as a result of these historical facts and considering that the\npeople of Cabinda were not consulted before their territory was ceded to Angola, the actions of the\nRespondent State amount to colonialism or neo-colonialism such that the people of Cabinda are entitled to\nself-determination.\nThe Commission's Analysis on the Merits\n91. Although it did not submit its observations on the Admissibility of the Communication despite the receipt\nof a formal invitation and reminders to that effect from the Secretariat,15 the first part of the Respondent\nState's submission on the Merit challenges the Admissibility of the Communication and raises issues that\namount to a preliminary objection to the consideration of the Communication. Before analysing the merits of\nthis Communication, the Commission considers it necessary to address some of the concerns raised by the\nRespondent State even though most of those issues ought to have been raised at the admissibility stage.\n92. The Commission notes the Respondent State's argument that Article 57 of the African Charter requires\nthat a Communication to be considered by the Commission should first be presented to the concerned\nState Party by the Chairperson of the African Commission, setting out procedural matters and indicating\nwhether the Communication conforms to the provisions of the African Charter and other AU instruments.\nArticle 57 reads as follows: Prior to any substantive consideration, all communications shall be brought to\nthe knowledge of the State concerned by the Chairman of the Commission\n93. The Commission affirms that Article 57 of the Charter obligates it to notify a State Party of the existence\nof a Complaint against such a State Party so that the State Party can participate in the proceedings. The\nCommission recalls that notice of this Communication was transmitted to the Respondent State by Note\nVerbale dated 28 February 2007. As indicated in paragraphs 16 to 20 and paragraphs 24 to 27 of the\nAdmissibility decision, the Secretariat through several subsequent correspondences transmitted to the\nRespondent State the original Complaint and all other documents filed by the Complainant regarding this\nCommunication. Further, as noted in paragraph 39 above, at least ten (10) reminders were sent to the\nRespondent State to respond to the Admissibility arguments but these did not yield any response from the\nRespondent State. Accordingly, the African Commission notes that it has satisfied its duty to the\nRespondent State as required by Article 57 of the African Charter.\n9\n\n\f94. The Respondent State further contends that the African Commission has failed to comply with Rule\n6(3)16 of its own Rules of Procedure. The Commission notes that the provisions cited by the Respondent\nState relating to the Provisional Agenda of the Commission's sessions are now contained in Rule 32 of the\nCommission's Rules of Procedure. The Commission recalls that Rule 32(2) of its Rules of Procedure\nprovides as follows: The provisional Agenda shall include but not be limited to, items on \"Communications\nfrom States\" and \"Other Communications\" in accordance with the provisions of Articles 48, 49 and 55 of the\nCharter.\n95. The Commission reaffirms that Rule 32(2) of its Rules of Procedure permits \"Other Communications\"17\nsuch as the one now being considered to be included in the Agenda of the Commission's Session. In line\nwith that provision, the present Communication is properly before the Commission as it has duly been\nincluded in the Agenda of the Session.\n96. The Respondent State contends further that the present Communication ought to have been declared\ninadmissible because it fails to comply with certain aspects of Article 56 of the African Charter. The\nCommission recalls that the Respondent State was contacted at every stage and given ample opportunity\nto present its position and arguments regarding the admissibility of this Communication but the Respondent\nState did not take advantage of the opportunity.\n97. The Commission notes further that in the event that a State Party fails to submit its observations on\nadmissibility within 60 days from the receipt of the Complainant's submission from the Secretariat as set out\nin Rule 105(2) of the Commission's Rules of Procedure, this Commission is authorised to proceed to make\na decision on the admissibility of the Communication. In such cases, the Commission examines the\nadmissibility submissions of the Complainant against the provisions of Article 56 of the African Charter. The\nCommission notes that in relation to the present Communication, this procedure has been followed to the\nletter. Accordingly, the Commission cannot revisit its admissibility decision in respect of the\nCommunication.\n98. Notwithstanding the fact that its Admissibility decision in respect of the Communication will not be\nreviewed, the Commission notes the Respondent State's argument that the present Communication should\nhave been declared inadmissible on the grounds that it contradicts Articles 3(b) and 4(b) of the AU\nConstitutive Act. In that regard, the Commission recalls the Complainant's submission that the present\nCommunication does not seek a decision on political self-determination or a right to secede from the\nRespondent State.\n99. In its correspondences and submissions to the Secretariat, the Complainant has maintained that its\nclaim is strictly restricted to a request for a decision on economic self-determination and a determination of\nthe right of the people of Cabinda to enjoy the use of natural resources located within the Province of\nCabinda. The Commission has also considered the prayers of the Complainant and notes that the claims\nas formulated do not contradict the provisions of Articles 3(b) and 4(b) of the AU Constitutive Act. The\nCommission does not consider itself bound to pronounce on the amicus briefs which seek to introduce\nsecessionist dimensions to the Communication. Accordingly, the Commission proceeds to determine the\nCommunication based on the submissions of the Parties.\nAlleged violation of article 14\n\n100. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated the right to property of the people of\nCabinda contrary to Article 14 of the African Charter. Article 14 of the African Charter provides as follows:\nThe right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be encroached upon in the interest of public need or\nin the general interest of the community and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\n101. The Complainant contends that an incident of the right to property as guaranteed in the African\nCharter is that the natural resources of Cabinda must be administered largely for the benefit of the people\nof Cabinda since the people of Cabinda claim a distinct identity from the rest of Angola. It is also the\nComplainant's argument that the Respondent State is not entitled to unilaterally grant resource licences\nand concessions on Cabinda resources.\n102. The Respondent State submits that its Constitution provides for the right to property and that the\nconstitutional right is available to all the peoples of Angola. However, the State argues that certain items\nare classified in its Constitution as property in the public domain intended to serve the wider national\ninterest rather than the interest of a smaller unit within the state. The Respondent State further challenges\nthe Complainant's argument that the Government of Angola has not managed natural resources for the\nbenefit of Cabinda people.\n10\n\n\f103. Generally, this Commission has stated in its jurisprudence that the role of the State in relation to the\nright to property is \"to respect and protect this right against any form of encroachment, and to regulate the\nexercise of this right in order for it to be accessible to everyone.18 One way of fulfilling Charter obligation on\nthe right to property is therefore to adopt legislation which recognises the principle of ownership and\npeaceful enjoyment of property. The inclusion of the right to property in the Angolan Constitution is\ntherefore in compliance with the Respondent State's Charter duty.\n104. With regards to the general question whether a \"people\" can be bearers of the right to property under\nthe African Charter, this Commission has previously answered in the affirmative in relation to indigenous\npeoples in Africa.19 The African Commission reaffirms that a collective or communal right to property exists\nas a component of the right to property in Article 14 of the African Charter. Similar to the individual right to\nproperty, the communal right to property entails a state duty to recognise and protect peaceful enjoyment of\nownership by a group or people subject to limitation by a state in the interest of public need or in the\ngeneral interest and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\n105. The Commission has also expressed the opinion that natural resources located in land owned or\noccupied by a people can be the subject of ownership in the context of the right to property under the\nAfrican Charter.20 In the Commission's view, protection of communal property rights to natural resources as\na component of land right enjoyed by indigenous peoples is not alien to the African Charter or to\ninternational human rights generally.21 One justification for the protection of this aspect of the right is the\nstrong traditional attachment to their cultural land that indigenous peoples hold on to such that their survival\ndepends on the resources they traditionally extract from the land.22\n106. The Commission notes that the Complainant does not claim that the people of Cabinda are indigenous\npeoples with strong attachment to their land and their culture. The basis of the Complainant's claim is that\nCabinda existed as a distinct Portuguese protectorate prior to 1975 when it was declared to be part of an\nindependent Angola without the consent of the people of Cabinda. The Commission does not believe that\ndistinct pre-colonial history on its own currently suffices to sustain a claim for special protection of a\ndistinctive overriding communal right to property under the Charter.\n107. In the absence of evidence that land in Cabinda is communally owned in a traditional context and that\nthe people of Cabinda had and continue to hold on to strong attachment to their land as part of a distinct\nculture which requires dependence on land and its resources for the survival of the people of Cabinda, the\nright to property can be validly limited by the State in the overall public interest of the entire state and in\naccordance with appropriate laws.\n108. In line with its obligation under International law, the African Charter and its domestic laws generally,\nthe Respondent State can only limit the right to property under certain laid down conditions. The\nComplainant has not claimed or adduced evidence to show that the limitation of the right in relation to the\npeople of Cabinda was not done in the public interest and according to appropriate laws.\n109. The Commission recalls the Complainant's argument that an incident of the right to property under the\nCharter is that the people of Cabinda are entitled to be the main beneficiaries of the natural resources and\nthat the Respondent State cannot unilaterally dispose of the natural resources of the people of Cabinda\nwithout their involvement in decisions on such disposal. The Commission agrees with the Complainant that\nas an aspect of the right to property under the Charter, the people of Cabinda are entitled to benefit from\nthe natural resource found in their lands. However, the Commission believes that the enjoyment of that\naspect of the right should not be to the detriment of other communities and groups in the State. The\nCommission notes further that the Respondent State's submission that the people of Cabinda (along with\nthe province of Zaire23 ) enjoy a fair and equitable share of the proceeds of the petroleum resources of the\nState has not been challenged despite the Complainant's claim that the people of Cabinda are entitled to\nan additional 50% of proceeds from natural resources.\n110. The Commission finds that the Complainant has failed to show that the people of Cabinda have a\nstrong and profound cultural or ancestral attachment to their land and the natural resources under the land\nsuch that their survival depends on its protection. The Complainant has also failed to show that the\nRespondent State has denied the people of Cabinda a right to share equitably in the benefits accruing from\ntheir natural resources. Accordingly, the African Commission finds no violation in relation to Article 14 of the\nAfrican Charter.\n\n11\n\n\fAlleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter\n\n111. The Complainant contends that the Respondent State has violated Article 19 of the Charter because\nthe people of Cabinda have not enjoyed the right to equality as a people entitled to the same respect and\nrights as other peoples in Angola. Article 19 provides that: All peoples shall be equal; they shall enjoy the\nsame respect and shall have the same rights. Nothing shall justify the domination of a people by another.\n112. It is the Complainant's submission that Article 19 of the Charter has been violated in relation to the\npeople of Cabinda because it anticipates that revenue from onshore resource extraction will \"flow to\nLuanda just as offshore revenue does now\". The Complainant alleges further that despite the resources\nextracted from Cabinda, unemployment is high and poverty, infant mortality and disease are higher in\nCabinda than in most other areas of Angola. Thus, it claims the Respondent State has violated Article 19 of\nthe African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\n113. In response to the alleged violation of Article 19 of the Charter, the Respondent State contends that its\nConstitution provides for the principle of equality and this is implemented in all its 18 provinces. The\nRespondent State argues further that 'it cannot implement measures aimed at developing the country\nbased on the premise that revenue should only be spent in areas where it is generated. The Respondent\nState submits that while it is developing the entire country, the Province of Cabinda enjoys a \"special status\nin view of its contribution towards the Angolan State General Budget\". Thus, it claims that it has not violated\nArticle 19 of the African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\n114. The Commission reaffirms its position that distinct and identifiable groups of \"peoples\" and\ncommunities exist within the State Parties to the African Charter and each set of \"peoples\" and\ncommunities is entitled to enjoy internal legal equality vis-?-vis other \"peoples\" and communities within the\nsame state.24 The Commission notes that a claim of unequal treatment in violation of Article 19 of the\nCharter requires evidence that a given group or set of peoples who is in a position similar to another group\nor set of people has been or is being treated differently or that a given group or set of peoples who is in a\nposition different to another group or set of people is treated similarly such that the \"peoples\" complaining\nsuffer unfair and unjustifiable disadvantage that amounts to discrimination.\n115. In its submission, the Complainant contends that the bulk of the anticipated revenue from the\nresources in Cabinda will \"flow to Luanda while only 10% or less will get to Cabinda\". The Complainant\ndoes not elaborate to show whether any single group of people in the Respondent State enjoys a greater\nshare of allocation than the People of Cabinda. The Complainant also provides no documentary or other\nevidence in support of its claim. The Complainant does not produce the 2006 Peace Accord which it refers\nto in its submission. However, the Respondent State does not contest the claims but admits them partially\nto the extent that the Respondent State submits that the Province of Cabinda enjoys a special status since\nit receives up to 10% of oil revenue.\n116. The Commission notes the Respondent State's submission that the 10% special revenue that accrues\nto Cabinda is in addition to other infrastructural costs that the Government funds in the Province of\nCabinda. Although the Respondent State has also failed to adduce any documentary or other evidence in\nsupport of this claim, the Complainant has not contested the Respondent State's claim that only the\nProvince of Cabinda (along with the Province of Zaire) enjoy the \"special status\". Accordingly, the\nCommission will make its decision on the basis of the unchallenged submissions of the Parties.\n117. Generally, the Commission holds the view that real or substantive equality requires that groups who\nhave suffered previous disadvantages or continue to suffer disadvantages within a state are entitled to\nsome advantageous treatment especially where such groups bear an unequal part of the burden for the\nexploration of natural resources in that state.25 However, the Commission also notes the Respondent\nState's argument that it cannot implement measures that aim at spending revenue only in areas where it is\ngenerated.\n118. The Commissions takes the view that the principle of equality requires the striking of a balance\nbetween a group's claim to advantageous treatment or affirmative action and the legitimate expectation of\nother groups within the state to share in the resources of that state. Accordingly, the Commission believes\nthat a proper interpretation of equality in the present circumstance is one which recognises the right of the\npeople of Cabinda to receive some advantage without endangering the survival of other peoples within the\nstate or threatening the continued corporate existence of the Respondent State.\n119. Although the Complainant contends that the people of Cabinda suffer unequal treatment as compared\nto the rest of Angola in terms of comparatively higher levels of unemployment, poverty, infant mortality and\ndisease, no tangible evidence or data has been adduced to support these claims. As this Commission had\n12\n\n\fpreviously observed, a Complainant that has made general claims and allegations needs to substantiate\nsuch claims and allegations with either documentary evidence or sworn affidavits or the corroborating\ntestimony of others.26 In the absence of evidence to support the claim of unequal treatment, the\nCommission does not find a violation of Article 19 of the Charter.\nAlleged violation of Article 20 of the African Charter\n\n120. Basing its argument on an acclaimed geographical, political, linguistic and cultural distinction from the\nrest of Angola, the Complainant claims that the Respondent State has violated the right of the people of\nCabinda to social and economic development as guaranteed in Article 20 of the African Charter. The\nComplainant submits that the people of Cabinda are unable to exercise the right because organisations\nthat \"espouse a uniquely Cabindan point of view\" are banned by the Government of Angola.\n121. The Complainant alleges further that the enjoyment of the right to social and economic development is\nrestricted because people who campaign for economic self-determination are routinely arrested. On these\ngrounds, the Complainant alleges that the right of the people of Cabinda to social and economic\ndevelopment had been violated.\n122. The Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 20 of the African Charter in relation to\nthe people of Cabinda because the right to self-determination had been collectively fulfilled by the entire\npeople of Angola at independence in 1975. The Respondent State submits further the periodic democratic\nelections take place in Angola and as citizens of Angola, the people of Cabinda have participated fully at\nsuch elections, producing 5 out of 220 deputies elected to the Angolan Parliament.\n123. It is the Respondent State's further contention that Cabinda also has its own political and\nadministrative structures defined by Angolan law. On these grounds and in view of Article 87 of its\nConstitution which acknowledges that Angola is a multicultural and multilingual society where the different\nidentities are to be appreciated and respected, the Respondent State contends that it has not violated\nArticle 20 of the African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\n124. The Commission recalls that Article 20 of the Charter has a particular historical context in the sense\nthat it is one of the provisions of the Charter that was aimed at addressing the situation of Africans who\nremained under colonial domination at the time the Charter was drafted. Article 20 of the Charter provides\nthat :\n\n1. All peoples shall have the right to existence. They shall have the unquestionable and inalienable\nright to self-determination. They shall freely determine their political status and shall pursue their\neconomic and social development according to the policy they have freely chosen.\n2. Colonised or oppressed people shall have the right to free themselves from the bonds of domination\nby resorting to any means recognised by the international community.\n3. All peoples shall have the right to the assistance of the State Parties to the present Charter in their\nliberation struggle against foreign domination, be it political, economic or cultural.\n125. The Commission notes the argument of the Complainant regarding the alleged violation of Article 20\nof the Charter. In view of its opinion that the right to self-determination, the right of colonised and oppressed\npeople to free themselves from domination and the right to assistance in liberation struggle are reserved for\ncolonised peoples, the Commission does not agree with the Complainant that a distinct pre-colonial history\nby itself entitles the people of Cabinda to unilaterally claim those rights contained vis-?-vis the Respondent\nState.\n126. As the Commission has noted in its earlier jurisprudence, in post-colonial Africa, the right to self\ndetermination can be enjoyed within the existing territories and with full respect for the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of State Parties to the Charter.27 The Commission also believes that the right to pursue\neconomic and social development is attainable within the framework of an existing state insofar as different\ngroups and communities are represented in decision-making institutions of the given state. Accordingly, the\nCommission does not find any violation of Article 20 of the Charter.\n\n13\n\n\fAlleged violation of Article 21 of the African Charter\n\n127. In relation to Article 21, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated the right of\nthe people of Cabinda to freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources because the Respondent\nState has made grants and concessions on Cabinda's onshore oil resources \"without input from the\nCabindans\". The Complainant contends that the acts the Respondent State in this regard amount to\nspoliation under Article 21 of the Charter and should attract a right to lawful recovery and to an adequate\ncompensation. Article 21 of the African Charter states as follows:\n\n1. All peoples shall freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources. This right shall be exercised in\nthe exclusive interest of the people. In no case shall a people be deprived of it.\n2. In all cases of spoliation, the disposed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of its\nproperty as well as to an adequate compensation.\n3. The free disposal of wealth and natural resources shall be exercised without prejudice to the\nobligation of promoting international economic cooperation based on mutual respect, equitable\nexchange and the principles of international law.\n4. State Parties to the present Charter shall individually and collectively exercise the right to free\ndisposal of their wealth and natural resources with a view to strengthening African Unity and\nsolidarity.\n5. State Parties to the present Charter shall undertake to eliminate all forms of foreign exploitation\nparticularly that practiced by all international monopolies so as to enable their peoples to fully\nbenefit from the advantages derived from their national resources.\n128. The Respondent State argues that by Articles 94 and 95 of its Constitution, natural resources fall in\nthe category of items classified as property in the public domain which are reserved to serve national rather\nnarrow local interests. The Respondent State submits further the Province of Cabinda already receives\nspecial attention for its contribution to oil revenues. Asserting its sovereign authority and legitimacy to\nexplore natural resources in Angolan territory, the Respondent State challenges the authority and\nlegitimacy of the Complainant to speak on behalf of the people of Cabinda with regards to the exploitation\nof natural resources.\n129. The Commission recalls its jurisprudence which traces the origin of Article 21 to the colonial era when\nhuman and material resources in Africa were exploited for the benefit of powers from outside the\ncontinent.28 However, the Commission has also held that the rights in Article 21 of the Charter are still\napplicable in post-colonial Africa in favour of groups within states to the extent that it triggers an obligation\non the part of the State Parties to protect their citizens from exploitation by external economic powers29 and\nto ensure that groups and communities, directly or through their representatives, are involved in decisions\nrelating to the disposal of their wealth.30 Nevertheless, the Commission also recognises the right of State\nParties to supervise the disposal of wealth in the general interest of the state and its communities.31\n130. The Commission notes that in relation to Article 21 of the Charter, the Complaint invokes a right of the\npeople of Cabinda to dispose of their wealth and natural resources as well as to receive compensation for\nresources already exploited. In this regard, the Commission notes that the term \"peoples\" in Article 21 of\nthe Charter can mean either the entire peoples of a given state or a \"peoples\" within the state. The\nCommission believes that in the first context, Article 21 of the African Charter empowers a State Party to\nexercise the guaranteed right free from interference from any other African or non-African state. This has to\nbe the explanation for sub-Articles 4 and 5 of Article 21 which speak to State Parties.\n131. However, the Commission believes that a \"peoples\" within an existing state can be beneficiaries of the\nright in Article 21 to the extent that it imposes a duty on the Respondent State to ensure that resources are\neffectively managed for the sole and equal benefit of the entire peoples of the state. Accordingly, the\nAfrican Commission is of the view that one aspect of the right in Article 21 of the African Charter is the duty\nof the State to involve representatives of its peoples in decisions concerning the management of national\nwealth and natural resources.\n132. The Respondent State has shown that elected representatives of the people of Cabinda are in the\nAngolan Parliament which exercises oversight supervision of the management of natural resources. As this\nCommission noted in SERAC v Nigeria,32 the State has the right to exploit natural resources in its territory.\nHowever, the Commission believes that Article 21 of the African Charter presupposes that that right is held\n14\n\n\fin trust for the people. The Respondent State's submission that it effectively manages natural resources for\nthe benefit of all peoples in Angola has not been challenged. The Commission therefore finds no violation\nof Article 21 of the Charter.\nAlleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter\n\n133. The Complainant's allegation that the Respondent State has violated Article 22 of the African Charter\nwith regards to the people of Cabinda is based exclusively on the argument that the Respondent State\npursues a policy of \"Angolanisation of Cabinda\". In the absence of any other argument or evidence in\nsupport, the African Commission finds no violation.\nAlleged violation of Article 24 of the African Charter\n\n134. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated Article 24 of the African Charter in\nrelation to the people of Cabinda because, as a result of oil exploitation activities authorised by the State,\nthe environment in Cabinda is not conducive for the development of the people of Cabinda. The\nComplainant argues further that the operations of companies such as Chevron which are authorised by the\nRespondent State take place in conditions that harm both human health and the environment and this has\nhappened because in the absence of viable civil society monitoring, the Respondent State has failed to\nenforce compliance with environmental rules.\n135. The Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 24 of the African Charter in relation to\nthe people of Cabinda since it has taken measures aimed at preserving the environment. The Respondent\nState cites national legislations that it has adopted to address the challenge of environmental pollution. The\nRespondent State submits further that it has compelled oil companies operating in the area to account for\nharm occasioned by oil spills, with emphasis on demanding compensation for fishermen and their families.\nThe Respondent also claims that it has set up a National Environment Surveillance Service that has kept\ntrack of at least six oil spills in the area while its Ministry of Environment has audited rigs in the Angolan sea\nto prevent further spills. In effect, the Respondent State contends that it has taken action to address the\nconcerns of the Complainant.\n136. The African Commission notes that apart from the fact that it did not adduce any evidence in support\nof the general allegation that the right to a satisfactory environment has been violated by the Respondent\nState, the Complainant has not disputed or challenged the claims of the Respondent State. In the absence\nof any evidence to support the alleged violation, the African Commission finds no violation of Article 24 of\nthe African Charter.\n\nDecision of the African Commission\n137. In view of the above, the African Commission finds no violations of Articles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24\nof the African Charter as alleged by the Complainants.\nDone in Banjul, the Gambia during the 54th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human\nand Peoples Rights, 22 October to 5 November 2013.\n\nFootnotes\n1 Angola ratified the African Charter on 2 March 1990.\n2 The alleged violations include extrajudicial/summary executions, arbitrary arrests and detention, sexual\nviolence, denial of civilians' freedom of movement, torture and other mistreatment.\n3 By email to the Secretariat dated 17 Feb 2012, Dr Levy advised the Secretariat to consider submission\nfrom Cabindan groups other himself as amicus briefs.\n4 Notes Verbale were sent to the Republic of Angola on 28 February 2007, 10 May 2007, 20 August 2007,\n19 December 2007, 25 March 2009, 27 April 2009, 23 June 2010, 30 September 2010, 7 December 2010\nand 11 August 2011.\n5 Communication 292/04 - Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa v.

Without them, the very physical and cultural survival of such\npeoples is at stake.123 Hence the need to protect the lands and resources they have traditionally used to\nprevent their extinction as a people. That is, the aim and purpose of the special measures required on\nbehalf of the members of indigenous and tribal communities is to guarantee that they may continue living\ntheir traditional way of life, and that their distinct cultural identity, social structure, economic system,\ncustoms, beliefs and traditions are respected, guaranteed and protected by States.\n.\n22 Ibid\n23 The Respondent State submits that the Province of Zaire also contributes significantly to the natural\nresources of Angola and accordingly, together with the Cabinda Province, enjoy certain privileges over and\nabove other provinces.\n24 COHRE case, para 223\n25 This is consistent with international best practices. See for instance, the Saramaka decision, para 103\n× Furthermore, the State's argument that it would be discriminatory to pass legislation that recognizes\ncommunal forms of land ownership is also without merit. It is a wellestablished principle of international law\nthat unequal treatment towards persons in unequal situations does not necessarily amount to impermissible\ndiscrimination. Legislation that recognizes said differences is therefore not necessarily discriminatory. In the\ncontext of members of indigenous and tribal peoples, this Court has already stated that special measures\nare necessary in order to ensure their survival in accordance with their traditions and customs (supra paras.\n78-86, 91, and 96). Thus, the State's arguments regarding its inability to create legislation in this area due\nto the alleged complexity of the issue or the possible discriminatory nature of such legislation are without\nmerit.\n26 Communication 308/05 - Majuru v Zimbabwe (2008) ACHPR, para 92\n27 Communication 75/92 - Katangese Peoples' Congress v Zaire (1995) ACHPR para 4\n28 Communication 155/96 - Social and Economic Rights Action Center (SERAC) & Center for Economic\nand Social Rights (CESR) v Nigeria (SERAC v Nigeria) (2001) para 56\n16\n\n\f29 SERAC v Nigeria, paras 57-58\n30 Endorois v Kenya, para 268\n31 Ibid\n32 155/96 para 54\n\n17\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"2","date":"November 5, 2013","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"","keywords":"Property rights, Right to self-determination, Equality and equal protection before the law","activity_report":"","outcome":"4"},"published":true},{"_id":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080cba8a","title":"Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and Interights v.

Egypt\nSummary of the Complaint\n1. This communication is brought before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the\nAfrican Commission or the Commission) on behalf of Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, Mohamed Abdalla\nAbu-Gareer and Ossama Mohamed Al-Nakhlawy (the Victims), by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal\nRights and Interights (the Complainants).\n2. The Respondent State is Egypt, a State Party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the\nAfrican Charter or the Charter).\n3. The Complainants state that the Victims were tried and sentenced to death after being accused of\nbombings which took place on 6 October 2004 and 23 July 2005 on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.\n4. The Complainants submit that on the night of 7 October 2004, three bombings took place in the Taba\nHilton Hotel and in two tourist resorts (Al-Badia and Gozor Al-Qamer) near Nuweiba, on the Sinai Peninsula\n(\"the Taba bombings\"). They further state that as a result of the attacks, 34 people died and at least 157\nwere injured. The Complainants say that the Victims were Egyptian, Israeli and other foreign tourists and\nworkers.\n5. They allege that the security forces of the Respondent State responded with a campaign of mass arrests\nand detentions in Northern Sinai, from where the perpetrators of the attacks were believed to have\noriginated. According to the Complainants, among those taken into custody was the First Victim, Mohamed\nGayez Sabbah.\n6. The Complainants also state that on 23 July 2005, a series of new bombings took place in the city of\nSharm El-Sheikh on the Sinai Peninsula, and that following those attacks, the security forces again\narrested a large number of Egyptian citizens, including Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani al-Nakhlawy (the\nSecond Victim) and Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer (the third victim), on 12 August and 28 September 2005,\nrespectively.\n7. According to the Complainants, agents of the State Security Intelligence (the SSI) subjected the victims\nto various forms of torture and ill-treatment during their detention, in order to \"confess\" before the State\nSecurity Prosecutor for their involvement in the Taba bombings. The Complainants state that the victims\nwere held incommunicado for a long period of time without access to a lawyer.\n8. The Complainants state that the victims were denied necessary medical attention as well forensic\nmedical examination during interrogation sessions. They allege that the victims were charged with crimes in\nrelation to the Taba bombings and were tried by the Supreme State Security Emergency Court in a trial\ncharacterized by procedural and substantive anomalies. They further allege that the court's decision was\nbased substantially on the 'confessions' obtained through torture and prolonged ill-treatment.\n9. They state that on 30 November 2006, the victims were sentenced to death by hanging. The\nComplainants state that the First Victim, Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, was arrested on 22 October 2004\npursuant to an Administrative Order issued under Law 162/1958 of the State of Emergency (the Emergency\nLaw).1 The Complainants allege that the first victim was held incommunicado detention by SSI agents until\nMarch 2005. They state that SSI agents blindfolded and bound the first victim, and occasionally hung him\nfrom the ceiling by his arms and legs.\n10. The Complainants state that the First Victim was held in these conditions for 96 days, being untied only\nduring his interrogation by the State Security Prosecutor.\n11. They further allege that SSI agents applied electrical shocks to several parts of his body. They state\nthat beatings and torture took place before and after his interrogation sessions by State Security\nProsecutors which started on 3 November 2004 and that most of the interrogation sessions took place\naround midnight and lasted for several hours each.\n12. They allege that despite the fact that the First Victim was tortured before these sessions, the\ninterrogation sheet completed by the State Security Prosecutor in respect of the First Victim indicated that\nthere were no visible injuries on his body.\n13. According to the Complainants, during the first interrogation session, the First Victim denied\ninvolvement in the Taba bombings. The Complainants submit that it was during the second session, held\non 4 November 2004 that the First Victim \"confessed\" to the State Security Prosecutor. The Complainants\n1\n\n\falso aver that the First Victim was held incommunicado, without access to his family, legal counsel, medical\ncare or a court until 24 March 2005. Requests for access to a defence lawyer by the first victim were\nignored.\n14. The Complainants allege that a plea submitted by a group of human rights lawyers to the Public\nProsecutor's Office, which exercises oversight over the State Security Prosecutor's Office, requesting\npermission to represent the victims together with others whose names had been printed in the local press\nas the chief suspects in the investigation of the Taba bombings, went unanswered.2\n15. Thus according to the Complainants, from the date of arrest on 22 October 2004 to 24 March 2005, the\nFirst Victim was denied access to counsel and that it was on 24 March 2005 that a lawyer attended the final\ninterrogation hearing during which the First Victim retracted his \"confessions\".\n16. The Complainants assert that the First Victim also requested medical attention and a forensic\nexamination in relation to his allegations of torture while in detention but the request for a forensic\nexamination was rejected by the Public Prosecutor's Office according to the viciously circular logic that only\na legal representative (which he was also denied) could make such a claim.\n17. According to the Complainants, the charges against the victims and two other individuals in relation to\nthe Taba bombings were referred to the Supreme State Security Emergency Court in Ismailiya on 30 March\n2005, and listed as case No. 40/20053 . They state that the trial started on 2 July 2005 and it was at this\ntime that the First Victim appeared before a judge for the first time since his arrest, eight months earlier.\nThe Complainants also assert that during the first hearing on 2 July 2005 the First Victim informed the court\nthat he had been tortured by SSI officers before and after interrogation sessions, in an attempt to force him\nto confess.\n18. The Complainants further state that the First Victim told the prosecutor about his torture and requested\nmedical attention, but the prosecutor denied his requests.\n19. The Complainants state that it was during this hearing that the First Victim and his defence counsel\nrequested that he be examined by a forensic expert. According to the Complainants, the court itself\nexamined the First Victim in camera, in the presence of his defence counsel as well as a lawyer attending\nthe hearing on behalf of Human Rights Watch. They state that he was stripped of his clothes for the court to\nexamine whether there were any physical signs of torture and that the court found \"... brown spots on his\narms.\"4 The Complainants further state that, as a result, the court granted the application for a medical\nexamination, and adjourned the trial to 24 July 2005.\n20. The Complainants aver that the Forensic Medical Authority (FMA) examination took place eight months\nafter the victim's alleged torture and that the report, dated 5 July 2005, noted injuries that were consistent\nwith the First Victim having been subjected to torture, including \"healings\" and \"dark discolorations\" on his\nright and left forearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint.5\n21. The Complainants also state that the two Government examiners concluded that \"due to the long lapse\nof time and the fact that the marks were not examined at the time they occurred, it was not possible to\ndetermine with certitude the reason, manner or time of such marks.\"6 According to the Complainants,\nfurther charges were preferred against the First Victim during his trial on 25 March 2006, in relation to the\nTaba bombings.\n22. The Complainants submit that the Second Victim, Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani Al-Nakhlawy, was\narrested on 12 August 2005 and placed under administrative detention pursuant to a decree of the Minister\nof Interior issued under the Emergency Law.\n23. The Complainants further submit that the Second Victim was also tortured by SSI officers during the\ninitial period of his detention and interrogation, including the use of electric shocks, beatings and\nsuspension from the roof in painful positions. They state that the Second Victim was only informed of the\ncharges against him on 22 August 2005, when he first appeared before the State Security Prosecutor for\ninterrogation.\n24. The Complainants assert that during the interrogation session, the Second Victim agreed to sign a\nwritten confession recounting his role in the Taba bombings. They state that during this session, the State\nSecurity Prosecutor indicated on the interrogation sheet that there were no visible injuries on the body of\nthe Second Victim.\n25. According to the Complainants, the Second Victim was denied access to a lawyer during the\ninterrogation sessions, which spanned a period of seven months and that during the session held on 19\nMarch 2006, the second victim insisted on summoning lawyers to represent him and to that effect\nsubmitted the names and mobile phone numbers of two human rights lawyers.\n\n2\n\n\f26. The Complainants further submit that on 25 March 2006, the State Security Prosecutor presented a\n\"complementary indictment\" in relation to the Taba bombings in which the First Victim had been charged\n(Case No. 40/2005).\n27. The Complainants state that the Second Victim also retracted his \"confessions\" before the court on 26\nMarch 2006 when he informed the court that he had been tortured during his detention. The Complainants\nsay that the court granted the Second Victim's request for a medical examination which took place two\nmonths later, nine months after the second victim's alleged torture. They state that the forensic medical\nreport, dated 27 May 2006, noted \"darker intersecting discolorations all over the back\" as well as an\nunhealed fracture in one of the toes of his left foot. The Complainants submit that despite the findings, the\nReport concluded that, due to the time lapse, it was not possible to determine precisely the cause or date7\nof the discolorations.\n28. The Complainants state that the Third Victim, Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer, was detained on 28\nSeptember 2005 under an Administrative Detention Decree issued under the Emergency Law.\n29. According to the Complainants, the period of their arrest was between 12 August and 28 September\n2005. The Complainants submit that the Third Victim was first interrogated by the State Security Prosecutor\non 20 November 2005, 50 days after his arrest, at which point he was informed of the charges against him.\n30. They state that on 25 March 2006 the Third Victim was referred to the Supreme State Security\nEmergency Court, as a result of the referral of the complementary indictment by the State Security\nProsecutor.\n31. They state that he had not been brought before a judge at any point during his six-month period of\npre-trial detention. According to the Complainants, he too was held in incommunicado detention without\naccess to family members, lawyers or medical care.\n32. The Complainants state that all the victims informed the court during the trial that they were subjected\nto beatings, electric shocks and different forms of cruel and degrading treatment, and that their requests for\nreferral to the Forensic Medical Authority were consistently denied by the Prosecution Office, but on a\nreferral by the court the examination confirmed the presence of several injuries but was unable to decisively\nconclude the cause of injuries due to the long period of time that had elapsed.\n33. The Complainants allege that the repeated requests of the victims to obtain official copies of the\ntranscript of the hearing of the trial were reportedly denied by the court.\n34. The Complainants aver that despite the obvious anomaly of the trial of the Victims and the objections\nraised by the defence with respect to procedural impropriety, the court proceeded with the trial and\nadjourned on September 2006 to 30 November 2006 to seek the Mufti's (Religious Adviser's) view on the\nproceedings in order to deliver its judgement. They state that according to Article 381 of the Criminal\nProcedure Code, the court is only obliged to seek the Mufti's view when it intends to issue a death\nsentence, indicating that the court had already reached verdict to sentence the Victims to death.\n35. According to the Complainants the victims were charged with; belonging to a group established in\nviolation of the provisions of the law and with the intention of flouting the provisions of the constitution and\nthe relevant laws as well as violating personal freedoms and targeting foreign tourists and the police as well\nas tourist installations; premeditated murder, attempted premeditated murder, damaging property, illegal\nmanufacture and possession of explosives and car robbery.\n\nArticles alleged to have been violated\n36. The Complainants submit that the rights of the victims under Articles 4, 5, 7 (1) (a), (c) and 26 of the\nAfrican Charter have been violated.\nPrayers\n37. The Complainants seek the following reliefs:\na. Recognition by the African Commission that the rights in the above mentioned articles in the Charter\nhave been violated;\nb. An order for compensation in respect of the violations of the rights of the victims;\nc. Harmonisation of the Respondent State's legislations in line with the Guidelines and Principles of the\nRights to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance adopted by the African Commission;\nd. Ensure that the appropriate mechanisms are implemented to avoid the reoccurrence of similar human\nrights violations.\n3\n\n\fProcedure\n38. The Complaint was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on Human and Peoples'\nRights (the Secretariat) during the Commission's 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November\n2006, in Banjul, The Gambia. A provisional measure was requested to be taken under Rule 111 of the\nAfrican Commission's Rules of Procedure.\n39. The African Commission decided to be seized of the communication at its 40th Ordinary Session, held\nfrom 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul, The Gambia.\n40. The African Commission requested for provisional measures under Rule 111(1) of its Rules of\nProcedure, via a letter dated 5 December 2006 addressed to the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n41. By letter dated 21 December 2006, the Complainants were informed that the African Commission had\ndecided at its 40th Ordinary Session to be seized of the communication and that a request for Provisional\nMeasures had been sent to the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and requested the Complainants\nto send their submissions on admissibility to the Secretariat by 21 march 2007.\n42. By Note Verbale dated 21 December 2006, the African Commission informed the Respondent State its\ndecision to be seized of the communication and brought to the attention of the Government to the request\nfor provisional measures that was previously sent, and requested that the submissions on admissibility of\nthe Respondent State be sent to the Secretariat by 21 March 2007.\n43. On 22 March 2007, the Secretariat received the submissions on admissibility of the Complainants.\n44. On 23 March 2007, the Secretariat received the submission on admissibility of the Respondent State in\nArabic language.\n45. By Note Verbale and letter dated 29 March 2007, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the\nsubmissions on admissibility of both parties and forwarded the submission to the other party.\n46. By letter dated 19 April 2007, the Secretariat transmitted to the Complainants the translated version\n(from Arabic to English) of the Respondent State's submissions on admissibility.\n47. By letter dated 20 April 2007, the Complainants acknowledged receipt of the African Commission's\nletter dated 19 April 2007, but informed the Secretariat that it had not received the previous letter dated 29\nMarch 2007 by which the submissions on admissibility in original Arabic language were forwarded.\n48. On 20 April 2007, the Secretariat forwarded again the original Arabic version of the Respondent State's\nsubmissions on admissibility to the Complainants.\n49. During its 41st Ordinary Session, held from 16 to 30 May 2007 in Accra, Ghana, both parties made oral\nsubmissions before the African Commission to clarify on their written submissions on the admissibility of\nthe communication. The representative of the Respondent State also submitted in writing what was\npresented orally before the Commission on this occasion and this document was added to the file.\n50. At its 41st Ordinary Session, held from 16 to 30 May 2007 in Accra, Ghana, the Commission declared\nthe communication admissible.\n51. By Note Verbale dated 8 June 2007, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State of its decision on\nadmissibility; the Complainants were also informed in a letter dated 6 June 2007. Both parties were invited\nto make their submission on the merits.\n52. On 7 June 2007, the Secretariat received from the Complainants a letter addressed to the Chairperson\nrequesting for renewal of the Provisional Measures under Rule 111(1).\n53. By letter dated 7 June 2007 addressed to H.E. President Hosni Moubarak, a request for provisional\nmeasures was made by the Commission.\n54. On 24th October 2007, the Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt to Dakar, Senegal, sent a Note\nVerbal to inquire about the submission if any, made by Complainants.\n55. At the 42nd Ordinary Session held in Brazzaville, Congo from 15 to 28 November 2007, the\nCommission deferred the communication to the 43rd Ordinary session so as to allow the parties to make\ntheir submissions on the merits. During that same Session, the Secretariat received a submission on the\nMerit from the Respondent State.\n56. By Note Verbale dated 20 March 2008 and letter dated 19 March 2008, the parties to the\ncommunication were informed that the 43rd Ordinary Session is scheduled to be held from 7 to 22 May\n2008 in Ezulwini, Swaziland.\n57. On 23 April 2008, the Secretariat received an electronic version of the submission on the merits from\nthe Complainants.\n\n4\n\n\f58. On 24 October 2008 the Secretariat transmitted to the Respondent State the submission on the merits\nof the Complainants.\n59. By letter dated 24 October 2008, the Complainants were informed that the 44th Ordinary Session will be\nheld in Abuja, Federal Republic of Nigeria from 10 to 24 November 2008.\n60. During the 44th Ordinary Session the African Commission considered the communication on the merits\nand deferred it to the 45th Ordinary Session scheduled to be held from 13 to 27 May 2009 in Banjul, The\nGambia.\n61. By Note Verbale and letter dated 19 December 2008, the Secretariat informed the parties of the\ndecision to defer the consideration on the Merit of the communication to the 45th Ordinary Session.\n62. By Note Verbale and a letter both dated 24 April 2009, the parties were reminded that the\ncommunication will be considered on the Merit at the 45th Ordinary Session to be held in Banjul, The\nGambia from 13-27 May 2009.\n63. By Note Verbale and letter dated 16 July 2009, the African Commission informed the parties of its\ndecision to defer the communication to the 46th Ordinary Session, scheduled to take place from 11 to 25\nNovember 2009.\n64. By Note Verbale and letter dated 20 December 2009, the African Commission informed parties of its\ndecision to defer consideration of this communication to the 47 Ordinary Session of the African\nCommission scheduled to take place from 12 to 26 May 2010.\n65. By Note Verbale and letter dated 11 June, the African Commission informed parties of its decision to\ndefer the communication to the 48th Ordinary Session scheduled to take place from 10 to 24 November\n2010.\n\nThe Law on Admissibility\nSubmissions of the Complainants on Admissibility\n\n66. The Complainants submit that all the criteria of Article 56 of the African Charter are satisfied and that\ntherefore, the communication should be declared admissible.\n67. On the issue of exhaustion of local remedies, the Complainants state that under the Emergency Law\n(Law No. 162 of 1958 as amended), the President may decide to commute the sentence, revoke the\njudgement, or order a retrial by another circuit of the State Security Emergency Court. They submit that in\nthe present case, the sentence imposed by the State Emergency Court on 30 November 2006 on the\nvictims becomes final once it has been ratified by the President of the Republic and that there is no judicial\nright to appeal the decision of the State Security Emergency Court.\n68. According to the Complainants, the President's decision under the Emergency Law is not judicial in\nnature and therefore it cannot be defined as an available remedy for the Complainants to pursue. They\ncompare the facts of the present communication to those of Constitutional Rights Project v Nigeria in which\nthe Commission described the power of the Governor to confirm or disallow the decision of a special\ntribunal in Nigeria as a \"discretionary, extraordinary remedy of a non-judicial nature\" and where it was\nfound that the Governor's decision was not a remedy of the nature that required exhaustion under Article\n56(5) of the African Charter. The Complainants also refer to Civil Liberties Organisation v Nigeria wherein\nit was found that in the absence of a judicial body to adjudicate on the Applicant's complaint, there was no\neffective remedy available.\n69. The Complainants further argue that the President's decision under the Emergency Law cannot be\nmade subject to any appeal. Therefore, they submit that the victims are left without any judicial right to\nappeal the decision of the State of Emergency Court.\nThe Respondent State's Submissions on Admissibility\n\n70. The Respondent State submits that the communication is inadmissible for two reasons: firstly, it was\nlodged before exhausting local means of redress as the sentence was not final; and secondly, the content\nof the communication is inaccurate.\n71. In terms of the second grounds the Respondent State submits that certain facts of the communication\nare false. It argues that the victims were given due process before and during the trial and that they had\naccess to lawyers during interrogations.\n5\n\n\f72. The Respondent State submits that the victims had access to a forensic doctor and were examined.\nThey further State that copies of court proceedings were made available to the victims and their lawyers\nand they were properly remanded by a court prior to the commencement of interrogations commenced.\n73. The Respondent State asserts that trial of the victims was fair and was conducted in public.\n74. On the issue of exhaustion of local remedies, the Respondent State submits in its written statement that\nthe judgment pronounced on 30 November 2006 by an Emergency Court is not final as it has not yet been\nendorsed.\n75. The Respondent State further explains that the Act No. 162 of 1958 stipulates that judgments by the\nState of Emergency Security Courts are only made final after being endorsed by the President of the\nRepublic (Article 42), and that the ratifying authorities may, in examining the judgment, mitigate the\nsentence, replace it by a more lenient punishment, rescind it or rescind part thereof or stop its\nimplementation or a part thereof (Article 14).\n76. In addition, the Respondent State points out that for endorsement, the law stipulates that all cases on\nwhich a ruling has been made must be examined by legal advisers assigned for this purpose to ascertain\nthat the proper procedure was followed.\n77. The Respondent State also submits that the law allows the person convicted to submit a written appeal\nto the Office of the Public Prosecutor.\n78. The Respondent State confirmed that the request for Provisional Measures sent by the Chairperson in\nDecember 2006 to suspend the execution of the death penalty sentence while the communication was\nbefore the Commission had been received, and further explained that the request was transmitted to the\nPresident of Egypt who considered it.\nThe Commission's Analysis on Admissibility\n79. The second ground submitted by the Respondent State pertains to the merits of the case and is not\nrelevant at the stage of admissibility.\n80. The admissibility of communications within the African Commission is governed by the requirements of\nArticle 56 of the African Charter which provides for seven requirements to be met before a communication\ncan be declared Admissible. If any of the requirements set out in this article are not met, the African\nCommission declares the communication Inadmissible, unless the Complainant provides sufficient\njustifications why any of the requirements could not be met.\n81. In the present communication, the Complainants claim that this communication fulfils all the\nrequirements of Article 56 of the African Charter. The Respondent State on the other hand submits that the\nComplainants have not fulfilled the requirements under Article 56(5) and as such, the African Commission\nshould declare the communication inadmissible. The Commission would thus analyze the arguments of\nboth parties based on the provisions of Article 56 of the Charter.\n82. Article 56(1) of the African Charter states that \"Communication relating to Human and Peoples' Rights...\nreceived by the Commission shall be considered if they indicate their authors even if the latter request\nanonymity...\" This communication is brought before the African Commission by the Egyptian Initiative for\nPersonal Rights and Interights, the Complainants, on behalf of the victims. In this communication, the\nauthors as well as the victims have been identified. The African Commission is therefore of the view that\nsub-article (1) of Article 56 has been complied with.\n83. Article 56(2) of the African Charter states that \"Communications...received by the Commission shall be\nconsidered if they are compatible with the Charter of the Organization of African Unity or with the present\nCharter.\" The present communication sets out that Articles 4, 5, 7(1) (a), and 26 of the African Charter have\nbeen violated. The communication is brought against the Arab Republic of Egypt a State Party to the\nAfrican Charter, and alleges violation of the rights of Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, Mohamed Abdallah\nAbu-Gareer and Ossama Mohamed Al-Nakhlawy who are in custody awaiting to be executed by the\nRespondent State. The African Commission therefore holds that the requirements under Article 56(2) have\nbeen fulfilled.\n84. Article 56(3) of the African Charter states that \"Communications ...received by the Commission shall be\nconsidered if they are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned\nand its institutions or to the Organisation of African Unity (AU)\". The present communication is not written in\na disparaging or insulting language directed to the Respondent State, its institutions or the AU and for\nthese reasons the African Commission holds that the requirements of Article 56(3) have been complied\n6\n\n\fwith.\n85. Article 56(4) of the African Charter states that \"Communications relating to human and Peoples'\nRights... shall be considered if they are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass\nmedia\". There is no evidence in this communication indicating that the allegations contained therein are\nbased exclusively on news or news disseminated through the mass media. The Complainants submit that\nthe communication is based on eyewitness evidence, as well as documented reports, which they have\nsubmitted along with the communication as attachments. The Respondent State have not challenged this\nassertion. For these reasons, the African Commission holds that the requirements of Article 56(4) have\nbeen fulfilled.\n86. Article 56(5) of the African Charter states that \"Communications relating to human and Peoples'\nRights... shall be considered if they are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that\nthis procedure is unduly prolonged\".\n87. The rationale of the local remedies rule both in the Charter and other international instruments is to\nensure that before proceedings are brought before an international body, the Respondent State concerned\nmust have had the opportunity to remedy the matters through its own local system. This prevents the\nCommission from acting as a court of first instance rather than a body of last resort. Three major criteria\ncould be deduced from the practice of the Commission in determining this rule, namely: the remedy must\nbe available, effective and sufficient.8\n88. The only issue at stake at this stage of admissibility in the present case is the one of the exhaustion of\nlocal remedies.\n89. It appears from the oral submissions of the Respondent State that there is no local remedy left for the\ncomplainants to exhaust. They argued that the decision of the State of Emergency Court has been\nexamined and confirmed by a legal adviser and the final procedure of endorsement (ratification by the\nPresident) of the decision of the State of Emergency Court what is a waiting. The outcome of these two\nprocedures did not change the decision of the State of Emergency Court.\n90. The fact that the endorsement of the Emergency Special Court in Egypt is of legal nature or not is not\nrelevant for the examination of the communication by the Commission at this stage, because what is at\nstake is whether there are other remedies available that the applicants did not resort to. The clarifications\nbrought before the Commission by the representatives of the Respondent State during the 41st Ordinary\nSession led to the conclusion that there were no other local remedies available for the Complainant to\nresort to. The endorsement process was completed and it was submitted by both parties that the\nComplainants had already used the appeal that was available to them by bringing their grievance to the\n\"judgment ratification office\" and that this remedy was unsuccessful.\n91. Most of the submissions made by the Respondent State and examined during the 41st Ordinary\nSession of the Commission refer to the notion of due process during the trial and would be examined at the\nmerits' stage. The respect of the rights of the Complainants is indeed a matter relevant at the merits stage\nand irrelevant at the admissibility stage.\n92. The African Commission in several communications held that the condition of exhaustion of local\nremedies \"should not constitute an unjustifiable impediment to access international remedies. Therefore,\nArticle 56(5) should be applied concomitantly with Article 7, which establishes and protect the right to fair\ntrial\"9 . To this extent the African Commission, in determining whether local remedies have been exhausted\ntakes into consideration the circumstances of each case, including the general context in which the formal\nremedies operate and the personal circumstances of the applicant.\"10\n93. In Communication No 250/2002 Zegveld v Eritrea11 , the African Commission confirmed that a\ndomestic remedy is considered effective if it offers a prospect of success, and sufficient or adequate if it is\ncapable of redressing the complaint.12 In Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara v The Gambia, the African\nCommission decided that the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also\nin practice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. In the instant case and\nconsistent with the jurisprudence of the Commission, there are no remedies remaining for the\nComplainants to pursue as they have no judicial right to appeal the decision of the State Security\nEmergency Court. What remains was for the President of the Republic to ratify the judgment to give force\nto it.\n94. Therefore, if the victim cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of lack of an effective legal\nremedy to address his fear and concerns, local remedies would be considered to be unavailable to him.\n95. In the present case, the sentence imposed by the State Security Emergency Court on 30 November\n2006 on the Victims becomes final once it has been ratified by the President of the Respondent State.\n7\n\n\fUnder Article 14 of the Emergency Law (Law No. 162 of 1958 as amended), the President may decide to\ncommute the sentence, revoke the judgment, or order a retrial by another circuit of the State Security\nEmergency Court. The President's decision is discretionary and cannot be made subject to any appeal.\n96. The African Commission decided in Communication No. 60/91 Constitutional Rights Project v Nigeria13\nthat purely discretionary remedies of non judicial nature where \"the object of the remedy is to obtain a\nfavour and not to vindicate a right\" are not of the kind contemplated by Article 56(5). In this decision, the\nAfrican Commission described the power of the Governor to confirm or disallow the decision of a Special\nTribunal in Nigeria as a \"discretionary, extraordinary remedy of a non-judicial nature.\"14 The African\nCommission stated that the remedy was neither adequate nor effective because the Governor was under\n\"no obligation to decide according to legal principles\"15 and concluded that the Governor's decision was\ntherefore not a remedy of the nature that required exhaustion under Article 56(5) of the Charter.16 In\nCommunication No 87/93 Civil Liberties Organisation v Nigeria [sic] , the African Commission also found\nthat in the absence of a judicial body to adjudicate the applicant's complaints, there was no effective\nremedy to which the applicant could have recourse.17\n97. In the Instant matter, the clarifications by the Representatives of the Respondent State during the 41st\nOrdinary Session led the Commission to the conclusion that there were no other local remedies available\nfor the victims to resort to. The ratification process was completed and it has been submitted by both\nparties that the victims had already used the appeal that was available to them by bringing their grievance\nto the \"judgment ratification office\" and that this remedy has proved unsuccessful.\n98. The African Commission therefore concludes that since the decision of the court is not appealable by\nany other judicial authority, the Complainants have exhausted the requirements of Article 56(5) of the\nCharter.\n99. Article 56(6) of the African Charter states that \"Communications relating to human and Peoples'\nRights... shall be considered if they: are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies\nare exhausted, or from the date the Commission is seized with the matter\". The Complainant states that the\ncase has been decided by the State Security Emergency Court whose decision was awaiting the ratification\nby the President of the Republic. The Secretariat of the African Commission received this communication\nduring the Commission's 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul The Gambia\nand acknowledged receipt by a letter dated 12 February 2007. The Charter does not provide for what\nconstitutes a reasonable time, for a Complainant to bring his/her Complaint before the Commission. The\nCommission has however dealt with this issue, on a case by case basis. The communication got to the\nCommission ten months after the decision of the State Security Emergency Court. The African Commission\nconsiders this to be a reasonable time, taking into consideration the complexities of getting a representation\nbefore an international body, and the challenges of communications system in Africa. The African\nCommission therefore holds that this provision has also been complied with.\n100. Article 56(7) of the African Charter states that \"Communications relating to human and Peoples'\nRights... shall be considered if they: do not deal with cases which have been settled by these states\ninvolved in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, or the Charter of the\nOrganisation of African Unity or the provisions of the present Charter.\" The Complainants state that this\ncommunication has not been settled by any international body and as such this requirement has been met.\nThe Respondent State did not object to Complainants assertion and there is no evidence before the\nCommission to show that the communication is being or has been settled by another international body.\nThe Commission therefore holds that the requirement set out in Article 56(7) has been fulfilled.\n101. Therefore, since all, under Article 56 have been met, the African Commission declares the\ncommunication Admissible and maintains the request for Provisional Measures communicated to the\nRespondent State on 5th December 2006, in order to prevent irreparable damages.\n102. Other submissions which are made by the Respondent State and examined during the 41st Ordinary\nSession of the Commission refer to the notion of due process during the trial and will be examined at the\nmerits stage.\nThe Merits\nThe Complainants' Submissions on the Merits\n\n103. The Complainants submit that the manner in which the Respondent State conducted the arrest,\ndetention, interrogation, trial and sentencing of the victims violates Articles 4, 5, 7 (1) (a), (c) and 26 of the\n8\n\n\fAfrican Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 5 (Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment)\n\n104. It is submitted by the Complainants that, the First Victim, Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, after his arrest on\n22 October 2004 was held incommunicado by SSI (State Security Intelligence) agents until March 2005.\nSSI agents blindfolded and bound him, and occasionally hung him from the ceiling by his arms and legs.\nAccording to the Complainants he was held in this condition for 96 days, being untied only during his\ninterrogation by the State Security Prosecutor. They also allege that the SSI agents applied electric shocks\nto several parts of his body. They further allege that this beatings and torture took place before and after his\ninterrogation sessions by state security prosecutors which started on 3 November 2004.\n105. The Complainants also submit that the First Victim initially denied involvement in the bombings but\ndue to the beatings and torture was compelled to change his plea and confessed on 4 November 2004.\nThey also submit that the First Victim was not allowed access to his family, lawyers, medical care until 24\nMarch 2005.\n106. The Complainants aver that the Second Victim, Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani Al-Nakhlawy, who\nwas arrested on 12 August 2005, was tortured by SSI officers during the initial period of his detention and\nquestioning, includes the use of electric shocks, beatings and suspension from the roof in painful positions.\nThey further submit that, during the interrogation session which spanned over seven months, the Second\nVictim was denied access to his legal counsel.\n107. They submit on behalf of the Third Victim, Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer, that between 28 September\n2005 and 20 November 2005, he was questioned by SSI officers in at least twenty-five sessions and that\nhe was subjected to electric shocks and suspended by the hands and legs in painful positions.\n108. In arguing this case, the Complainants further refer to the African Commission's jurisprudence18 where\nit held that the prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment includes 'actions which cause\nserious physical or psychological suffering (or) humiliate the individual or force him or her to act against his\nor her will or conscience'.\n109. The African Commission was also referred to the absolute prohibition of torture and ill treatment as\ncontained in the Robben Island Guidelines19 and Hurilaws v Nigeria20 . They further contend that the\nabsolute character of the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment is recognized in other regional and\ninternational instruments including the RIG and CAT.21 The Complainants submit that even those\ninstruments which, in contrast to the African Charter, allow for some derogation during times of national\nemergency explicitly exclude from the scope of permissible derogation, inter alia, the provisions prohibiting\ntorture and ill-treatment.22 The Complainants argue that even the undoubted threat posed by terrorism, do\nnot affect in any way the absolute prohibition on torture.23\n110. The Complainants further argue that, because of the importance of the values it protects, and as\ninternational courts and bodies have recognized, the prohibition of torture has now evolved into a\nperemptory norm or jus cogens, reflecting that the prohibition has become one of the most fundamental\nstandards in the international community.24\n111. The Complainants submit that, not only is the Respondent State required to refrain from torture and\nill-treatment, but also that, it must take positive measures to effectively prevent and protect against it. They\nargue that, certain safeguards - such as access to counsel, courts and medical personnel, and the\ninadmissibility of evidence obtained through torture - are inherent aspects of the prohibition of torture and\nill-treatment. They further submit that where torture or ill-treatment does arise, the Respondent State is\nobliged to respond with effective investigation and remedial action. The importance of such measures they\nargue, lies firstly, in acting as a deterrent to the commission of torture and ill-treatment and, secondly, in\nensuring that where torture and other ill-treatment occurs, it is investigated and documented. The\nComplainants refer the African Commission to General Comment No. 2 of the Committee against Torture,\nwhich recognized judicial remedies and access to counsel and to medical assistance during detention as\n\"baseline\" guarantees which the state is obliged to respect in order to give effect to the obligation to prevent\nand protect against torture or ill-treatment.25\n112. The Complainants argue that under the African Charter, a parallel obligation to prevent torture or\nill-treatment derives from the undertaking given by the States Parties in Article 1 of the Charter \"to adopt\nlegislative or other measures to give effect\" to the rights contained in the Charter. The importance of such\nsafeguards, the Complainants argue, has been recognized by the African Commission in the Robben\nIsland Guidelines.26 The Complainants aver that, the Commission itself has noted that while \"punishment of\n9\n\n\fthe torturer is important, [...] preventive measures such as halting of incommunicado detention, effective\nremedies under a transparent, independent and efficient legal system, and ongoing investigations into\nallegations of torture\"27 are the best ways to deal with such atrocities.\n113. It is submitted by the Complainants that, the victims were subjected to torture and ill-treatment by state\nagents - members of the security forces - while they were in state custody. They argue that, the victims\nwere subjected to repeated electric shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging, binding and blindfolding aimed at\ntheir complete disorientation. They further state that, this treatment, which was inflicted by state officials on\nthe victims, which intended to elicit confessions and information, clearly meets the torture threshold.\n114. The Complainants also argue that, although the context of the victims incommunicado detention and\ninterrogation is such that available evidence is necessarily limited, the allegations of torture and\nill-treatment are supported by the victims' independent testimonies of similar ill-treatment. According to the\nComplainants, the fact that the victims were held incommunicado, hidden from the outside world during the\n6-9 months of pre-trial detention, and that access to medical professionals was persistently denied until\nduring trial itself is indicative of ill-treatment. They submit that, the irregular nature of the \"interrogation\"\nsessions which is also consistent with the decision to interrogate late at night is a form of ill-treatment.\n115. The Complainants submit that the Forensic Medical Report, following the examination of the first\nvictim on 5 July 2005, nearly nine months after his injuries were sustained, noted \"healings\" and \"dark\ndiscolorations\" on his right and left forearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint. The\nsecond report of the FMA of 27 May 2006, following examination of the second and third victims also nearly\nnine months after their torture, found that the Second victim had a \"darker intersecting discolorations\" all\nover his back, as well as an unhealed fracture in a left foot toe and that the third victim had dark\ndiscolorations in the chest, abdomen and upper arms. The Complainants concede that, in both cases the\ngovernment examiners concluded that the long time lapse between being examined and the injuries made\nit impossible to determine with certainty the reason, manner or time of such injuries.\"\n116. The Complainants aver that their allegations are consistent with reports of the systemic nature of\ntorture by security forces in Egypt in cases such as the present one. By referring the African Commission to\nthe 1996 findings into the use of torture in Egypt, in which it concluded that \"torture is systematically\npracticed by the security forces in Egypt, in particular by State Security Intelligence\",28 the Complainants\nargue that human rights mechanisms consistently point to widespread and systematic torture in places of\ndetention in Egypt. The Complainants also refer the African Commission to the decision of the Committee\nAgainst Torture which found that \"Egypt resorted to consistent and widespread use of torture against\ndetainees\" and that \"[r]isk of such treatment was particularly high in the case of detainees held for political\nand security reasons.\"29\n117. The Complainants aver that under international human rights law, when a person is injured in\ndetention or while under the control of security forces, there is a strong presumption that the person was\nsubjected to torture or ill-treatment. They argue that, it is incumbent on the state to provide a plausible\nexplanation of how the injuries were caused.30\n118. The Complainants also argue that, the Respondent State has failed to discharge this burden in that,\nthey made no attempt to give satisfactory explanation of how the injuries were sustained, or to take any\nsteps to investigate and address the surrounding circumstances. The Complainants contend further that,\nthe trial court did nothing to follow up on questions raised in the FMA reports or the victims' testimonies.\nThey also argue that the SSI officers who were called to testify against the defendants in court were not\nasked to confront a single question with regard to the alleged torture and ill-treatment. They submit that the\njudgment fails to mention, still less to address, the allegations of ill-treatment; and that the authorities have\ncontinuously failed to take any steps to investigate the allegations of ill-treatment or the questions raised by\nthe FMA reports.\n119. The Complainants also contend that the carrying out of a death sentence using a particular method of\nexecution may amount to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if the suffering caused in\nexecution of the sentence is excessive and goes beyond that strictly necessary. They further argue that\nwhere a death sentence has been imposed \"it must be carried out in such a way as to cause the least\npossible physical and mental suffering.\"31 This approach they submit was tested and applied in the case of\nNg v. Canada where it was found that the particular method of gas asphyxiation fell foul [sic] of it.32\n120. The Complainants submit that in the present case, the victims have been sentenced to death by\nhanging. Hanging, they contend, is a notoriously slow and painful means of execution. If carried out without\nappropriate attention to the weight of the person condemned, hanging can result either in slow and painful\nstrangulation, because the neck is not immediately broken by the drop, or, at the other extreme, in the\n10\n\n\fseparation of the head from the body. The risk of either possibility is not compatible with respect for the\ninherent dignity of the individual and the duty to minimize unnecessary suffering.\nAlleged Violation of Articles 7(1) and 26 (Right to Fair Trial and Independent Judiciary)\n\n121. The Complainants argue that the victims right to a fair trial was violated in that; (a) they were tried by a\ncourt that was not independent and impartial and whose decisions is not subject to appeal; (b) their right to\na counsel was not fully respected; (c) confessions made under torture or ill-treatment were used by the\ncourt, and\n122. The Complainants also submit that by virtue of Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter, the victims have\n\"the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal\". They also state that, the\nvictims were tried by an exceptional security court, which failed to meet the minimum guarantees of an\nindependent and impartial tribunal.\n123. The Complainants state that the requirement of impartiality in Article 7 of the Charter is complemented\nby Article 26 of the same which imposes on States Parties 'the duty to guarantee the independence of the\ncourts' in their respective territories. These obligations, they submit, are captured in the Commission's\nPrinciples and Guidelines on Fair Trial wherein the Commission inter alia stated that: 'judicial bodies shall\nbe established by law to have adjudicative functions to determine matters within their competence on the\nbasis of the rule of law and in accordance with proceedings conducted in the prescribed manner;33 there\nshould not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process nor shall decisions be\nsubject to revision except through judicial review;34 all judicial bodies shall be independent from the\nExecutive branch35 and the government shall respect that independence;36 the process of appointments to\njudicial bodies shall be transparent;37 the judicial body shall decide matters before it without any\nrestrictions, improper influence, inducements, pressure, threats or interference, direct or indirect, from any\nquarter or for any reason.38\n124. The Complainants aver that, not applying these fair trial principles stated above, to special tribunals,\nviolates Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter because their composition is at the discretion of the executive\nbranch. They also contend that the removal of cases from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and placing\nthem before an extension of the executive branch necessarily compromises their impartiality39 and that\n\"[the] very existence [of such special tribunals] constitutes a violation of the principles of impartiality and\nindependence of the judiciary.\"40\n125. The Complainants state that the above averments are founded on the jurisprudence of the African\nCommission and are equally reflected in broader international and comparative law approaches to the right\nto be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal. To support this position the Complainants refer the\nAfrican Commission to the jurisprudence and case law of other regional and international and human rights\nmechanisms. They argue that an interpretation of such a right under Article 14(1) of the ICCPR has been\ndeemed to be \"an absolute right that may suffer no exception,\"41 and that where the executive is able to\n'control or direct' the judiciary, the notion of an independent and impartial tribunal is violated.42 This\njurisprudence they submit has been followed by regional human rights treaty bodies such as the\nInter-American and European Courts of Human Rights, which have similarly held that special courts with\nclose ties to the executive branch violate provisions requiring an independent and impartial tribunal.43\n126. The Complainants state that the competence and procedures of the Supreme State Security\nEmergency Court, an Exceptional Court, which tried the victims fall far short of the above standards. They\nalso argue that the Supreme State Security Emergency Court was established by the Emergency Law as a\ntemporary court,44 although, like the Emergency Law itself, it has been in force continually since 1981. The\nEmergency Law gives the court the primary competence of ruling on crimes perpetrated in violation of\ndecrees issued by the President of the Republic in application of the Emergency Law,45 but the President\nof the Republic may also, at his/her discretion, refer any ordinary crime to the Supreme State Security\nEmergency Court.46 According to Presidential Decree 1/1981 regarding the referral of some crimes to\nEmergency State Security Courts, all felonies and misdemeanors against the government's security or\nrelated to explosives shall be referred to State Security Emergency Courts, established under the\nEmergency Law.\n127. It is further contended by the Complainant that the composition of the Supreme State Security\nEmergency Court, and the procedure for appointments to it, illustrate the lack of independence. They state\nthat while normally composed of three judges of the Court of Appeal,47 the President of the Republic may\norder that the Security Court be formed of three judges of the Court of Appeal and two officers of the\n11\n\n\farmy,48 or simply decide that it be formed of three military officers.49 Before appointing the judges and/or\nmilitary officers, the law provides that the President of the Republic shall seek the opinion of the respective\nMinister of Justice and the Minister of War.50\n128. The Complainants also argue that, the degree of control which the President of the Republic exercises\nover the composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the State Security Court is antithetical to\nthe notion of an independent and impartial judicial process because, the President, for example exercises\nthe following powers:\n? the President may suspend a case before it is submitted to Supreme State Security Emergency Court or\norder the temporary release of the accused person before referral of the case to the Supreme State\nSecurity Emergency Court;51\n?? decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency Court are final only when they're approved by the\nPresident of the Republic, and cannot thereafter be challenged before any other court in Egypt;52\n? the President of the Republic may commute, change, suspend or cancel such decisions. He may also\norder the release of defendants53 ; and or\n? order the retrial of the case before another court.54\n129. The Complainants further aver that, this lack of independence and impartiality of the Supreme State\nSecurity Emergency Court has been identified and criticized by the Human Rights Committee when it\nexpressed its 'alarm' at the fact that \"that Military Courts and State Security Courts have jurisdiction to try\ncivilians accused of terrorism although there are no guarantees of those Courts' independence and their\ndecisions are not subject to appeal before a higher Court.\"55\n130. With regards to the right to a counsel, as enshrined in Article 7(1) (c) of the African Charter, 56 the\nComplainants contend that this right which underpins several others, such as freedom from ill-treatment\nand the right to prepare a defense,57 should be observed during all stages of criminal prosecution\n\"including preliminary investigations in which evidence is taken, periods of administrative detention, trial\nand appeal proceedings.\"58 They submit that in proceedings relating to criminal charges, legal\nrepresentation is the \"best means of legal defence against infringements of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms\".59 They also argue that in cases involving capital punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused\nmust be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all stages of the proceedings\".60\n131. They refer the African Commission to its decision in the matter of Malawi African Association and\nOthers v. Mauritania,61 the Complainants submit that the right to counsel in Article 7 refers to the right to\ncounsel of the detainee or defendant's choice and argues that where the accused either had no access, or\nonly restricted or delayed access, to lawyers, there is a violation of Article 7(1) (c). They contend that this\nright guarantees the right to timely and confidential consultations with that counsel.62\n132. The Complainants further argue that although the European system has recognized that in certain\nexceptional circumstances it may be necessary to limit the right to counsel, such restrictions can only be\nallowed if they are no more than strictly necessary and do not hinder the fairness of the proceedings.63 The\nComplainants refer the African Commission to the case of Ocalan v. Turkey, where the court held inter alia\nthat the denial of access to a lawyer for ten days during interrogations, \"a situation where the rights of the\ndefence might well be irretrievably prejudiced\", interfered with the fairness of the proceedings and violated\nthe defendant's human rights.64\n133. In the instant matter, the Complainants state that none of the Victims had lawyers present at the\ncritical early interrogation stage. They argue that on 23 November 2004 a group of human rights lawyers\nsubmitted a specific request to the Public Prosecutor's Office (registered under number 16332) to legally\nrepresent a number of individuals, including the First Victim but received no response. They submit that the\nFirst Victim was denied representation at interrogations for a period of 5 months until 24 March 2005 and\nthe Second and Third Victims had no access to counsel until 26 March 2006, when they first appeared in\ncourt.\n134. The Complainants submit that, even at the beginning of the trial, all three victims were denied the\nopportunity to consult with counsel privately, in order to prepare their defence. They also submit that, the\nlawyer client communication took place through bars of the court room, in the presence of, and within\nearshot security officials. It is submitted that the complete denial of access to counsel before their\nappearance in court and the restrictive access thereafter, violated the right to counsel and the right to a\n12\n\n\fdefence under Article 7(1) (c).65\n135. With regards to the issue of the State Security Emergency Court's reliance on the \"confessions\" of the\nthree Victims, the Complainants submit that \"any confession or other evidence obtained by any form of\ncoercion or force may not be admitted as evidence or considered as probative of any fact at trial or in\nsentencing.\"66 They argue that \"any confession or admission obtained during incommunicado detention\nshall be considered to have been obtained by coercion.\"67 They further argue that any evidence and/or\nconfessions obtained through torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment cannot be used in judicial\nproceedings except for the purpose of prosecuting the act of torture or ill-treatment itself.68\n136. Relying on decisions from European Court of Human Rights69 , the Complainants aver that the use of\nevidence obtained under torture or ill-treatment in criminal proceedings raises serious issues as to the\nfairness of such proceedings. They contend that any incriminating evidence - whether in the form of a\nconfession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of treatment\nwhich can be characterized as torture should never be relied on as proof of the victim's guilt, irrespective of\nits probative value.\"70 They further submit that the Egyptian Constitution of 1971 also stipulates that \"if a\nconfession is proved to have been made by a person under any ...forms of duress or coercion, it shall be\nconsidered invalid and futile\".71\n137. The Complainants submit that although the Committee against Torture has affirmed in a number of\ncases that, \"it is for the author to demonstrate that the allegations are well founded\", 72 the duty is generally\non the state to prove that the confessions were freely obtained.73 In support of this view the Complainants\nrefer the Commission to observations of the Human Rights Committee that \"all allegations that statements\nof detainees have been obtained through coercion must lead to an investigation and such statements must\nnever be used as evidence, except as evidence of torture, and the burden of proof, in such cases, should\nnot be borne by the alleged victim.\"74 The African Commission was also referred to in the UN Report of the\nSpecial Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, who had\nnoted that \"[...] the applicant is only required to demonstrate that his or her allegations of torture are well\nfounded. This means that the burden of proof to ascertain whether or not statements invoked as evidence\nin any proceedings, including extradition proceedings, have been made as a result of torture shifts to the\nState, [sic]75\n138. The Complainants assert that the victims in this case all raised allegations of torture and ill-treatment\nand that these allegations are at least consistent with the circumstances of their case, such as the\nincommunicado nature of their detention and the reports of the FMA which, at a minimum, indicate a risk of\nill-treatment. The Complainants also state that despite these concerns, and the apparent inconsistency and\nunreliability of the evidence, the \"confessions\" were admitted as evidence and appear to have formed at\nleast part of the basis of their convictions and the imposition of the death penalty. The reliance on such\nevidence, they argue, violates Article 7 of the Charter.\n139. With regards to the right to appeal, the Complainants aver that Article 12 of the Egyptian Emergency\nLaw stipulates that \"It is not allowed in any form to appeal the decisions pronounced by State Security\nCourts.\" They argue that these laws, and its application in practice, violate Article 7(1) (a) of the Charter,\nwhich provides for 'the right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his\nfundamental rights as recognized and guaranteed by conventions, laws, regulations and customs in force.'\n140. The Complainants also submit that States Parties should guarantee the right to appeal as well as\nprovide for a genuine and timely review of the cases, including the facts and the law\",76 and that in extreme\ncases where life is at risk States Parties should take steps to make appeals mandatory especially in death\npenalty cases.77 The Complainants refer the Commission to its decisions in Law Office of Ghazi Suleiman\nv Sudan78 to highlight the importance of appeal rights in the Commission's jurisprudence, and to Civil\nLiberties Organization and Others v. Nigeria79 concerning the right to appeal in death penalty cases.\n141. As a result of the above, the Complainants submit that the court before which the victims were tried\nfailed to meet the criteria which the Commission has identified as essential for an independent and\nimpartial tribunal and urged the Commission to hold that the Arab Republic of Egypt has violated Articles 7\nand 26 of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 4 (Right to Life)\n\n142. In support of the alleged violation of Article 4 of the African Charter, the Complainants contend that\nalthough the imposition of the death penalty is not per se unlawful under the Charter or broader\ninternational human rights law, certain circumstances, which are present in this case, will render it a breach\n13\n\n\fof the right to life. For the purposes of this instant case the Complainant argued that these special\ncircumstances would include situations where the sentence was passed without meeting the requirements\nof a fair trial set out in Article 7 of the African Charter; and where the death penalty is mandatory or\nautomatic, imposed by law rather than being applied by a court of law in light of all relevant circumstances.\n143. They submit that in criminal proceedings which may lead to the imposition of the death penalty,\nrespect for due process is required to ensure that the right to life guaranteed under Article 4 of the Charter\nis not violated. By referring the African Commission to its decisions in International Pen and Others (on\nbehalf of Saro-Wiwa) v Nigeria80 and in Malawi African Association and Others v Mauritania, they argue\nthat, where the death penalty is unlawfully imposed, Article 4 is violated because the victims' rights under\nArticle 7 of the Charter had been denied.\n144. The Complainants submit that 'a higher threshold of rights is intended for those who are charged with\ncrimes the sentence of which might be the death penalty'81 , which explains the need for \"scrupulous\nrespect of the guarantees of fair trial\" in capital offence cases.82 It is submitted that the Respondent State in\na statement to the UN General Assembly in 2007 recognized the critical nature of respect for due process\nrights in capital offence cases.83\n145. It is contended by the Complainants that the imposition of the death sentence by the Supreme State\nSecurity Emergency Court in the particular circumstances of this case would amount to an arbitrary\ndeprivation of life.\nThe Respondent State's Submissions on the Merits\n\n146. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 5, the Respondent State submits that Article 42\n× Article 42 Any person arrested, detained or his freedom restricted shall be treated in the manner\nconcomitant with the preservation of his dignity. No physical or moral harm is to be inflicted upon him. He\nmay not be detained or imprisoned except in places defined by laws organising prisons. If a confession is\nproved to have been made by a person under any of the aforementioned forms of duress or coercion, it\nshall be considered invalid and futile.\nof the Constitution of Egypt provides for and guarantees the right to security of the person and that if a\nconfession is proved to have been made by a person under duress or coercion, it shall be considered\ninvalid and futile. It is further submitted by the Respondent State that Article 57\n× of the same Constitution provides that \"any assault on individual freedom or on the inviolability of the\nprivate life of citizens and any other public rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and Article 57\nAny assault on individual freedom or on the inviolability of private life of citizens and any other public rights\nand liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and the law shall be considered a crime, whose criminal and\ncivil lawsuit is not liable to prescription. The State shall grant a fair compensation to the victim of such an\nassault.\nthe law shall be considered a crime, whose criminal and civil lawsuit is not liable to prescription. The State\nshall grant a fair compensation to the victim of such an assault.\"\n147. Concerning the allegation that the victims were denied visits while in detention, the Respondent State\nsubmit that the relatives of Ossama Mohamed al- Nakhlawy visited him 17 times, the relatives of Mohamed\nGayez Sabah visited him 30 times and the relatives of Yunis Mohamed Abu Gareer visited him 16 times\nuntil April 2007. These, argues the Respondent State shows that the allegations of the Complainants are\nbaseless.\n148. The Respondent State avers that its penal code criminalizes acts of torture in Articles 126 and 282,\nand that the same code further criminalizes unjustified detention imposes penalties exceeding those\ndecided by Articles 127 and 280.\n149. The Respondent State contends that, the assessment, value and reliance on any confession as a\npiece of evidence in any criminal proceedings is an issue entirely at the discretion of the Court. It is argued\nthat it is the judge who in exercise of this discretion decides whether or not to accept and rely on the\nconfession as reliable evidence for conviction.\n150. It is contended by the Respondent State that the judge's competence to assess the value of a\nconfession entails as well his competence to interpret it, define its significance and explore its motives. This\nprinciple, argues the Respondent State, applies whether the confession was judicial or non judicial, whether\nit took place in the process of factual investigation, interrogation or even before a normal person. The\njudge, argues the Respondent State, does not rely on a confession if he is not convinced with it even in the\n14\n\n\fcase where the accused person insists on his confession. In such a case, the judge may issue an acquittal\nand clarify in the causation why he did not take the confession into consideration. If it is proved that the\nconfession was made under duress or coercion, it would be considered as invalid. But this does not prevent\nthe court from taking other evidences to prove the accusation.\n151. It is argued by the Respondent State that the court judgment against the victims took into\nconsideration all the circumstances related to the facts according to the satisfaction of the court based upon\nthe processes in the case, the investigations, the court sessions and the related hearings of witnesses and\nthe written and verbal pleadings of the defence in order to clarify the facts, the elements of the crime and\nthe provisions of the law applicable thereon. The Respondent State argues that the court considered,\nscrutinized and analyzed all the evidences of the subject matter of the complaint including the related\nmedical and technical reports and the public prosecution investigations to reach the facts upon which its\njudgment was established.\n152. It is further contended by the Respondent State that the court responded to all the pleas of the\ndefence during the trial including the plea of the invalidity of the confessions, and that the court was\nsatisfied that the confessions of the victims and the other accused persons during the investigation were\nmade by persons who have the will and the discernment and are fully aware of the charges against them.\n153. The Respondent State submits that when the accused persons first appeared before the public\nprosecutor they were free from any injuries. They further submit that the court was certain that the victims\nwere fully aware that the investigations were made by the Public Prosecution Office (PPO) and that the\nPPO had informed them of the charges against them. The Respondent State also stated that 'the Office of\nthe Public Prosecutor in carrying out its investigations, interrogated the accused, Mohamed Gaiz Sabah in\nfour sessions, Osama Abdel Ghani El-Nakhlawi in eight sessions and Mohamed Alyan Abu Garir in twenty\nfive sessions. During these sessions, all the accused pleaded guilty of having committed the crimes\nattributed to them'.\n154. The Respondent State contends that as a result of the findings of the PPO, the victims were referred\nto Court in suit number No. 40/2005 of breaching security under the State of Emergency by committing\ncapital offence. The Court, the Respondent State contends, had responded throughout its sittings to all the\nrequests made by the victims. They also submit that the Court had during deliberations allowed the victims\nand their defence to produce evidence in support of their case and to bring their own to witnesses. They\nfurther submit that the Complainants were heard and that their request to be examined by a forensic doctor\nwas also granted. They submit that the court equally heard the Complainants submissions in defence of the\nvictims in 12 sessions and that they were allowed access to visit victims whenever they requested. They\nalso submit that the Complainants were given copies of the minutes of investigations and all the records of\ncourt sittings as well as the witnesses and that the court was convinced that their confessions were valid.\n155. Concerning the Complainants' allegation that the fair trial rights of the victims were violated, the\nRespondent State adopted its earlier position that the victims had a fair and just trial before a legal, national\nand competent court. They submit that the trial sessions were public and were attended by the lawyers who\nrepresented the victims; and that, the trial was concluded within a reasonable period.\n156. The Respondent State argues that it is clear from the court processes that the victims were tried\nbefore a legal, national and independent court constituted of judges who enjoy judicial immunity. This\naccording to the Respondent State negates the allegation of a any violation of Article 26 of the African\nCharter.\n\nThe African Commission's Analysis on the Merits\n157. In this communication, the African Commission is called upon to determine whether the arrest, pre-trial\ndetention, trial and sentencing of the Victims by the Respondent State following their alleged involvement in\na bomb attack on 6 October 2004, in the Taba and Noueiba' resorts of the Sinai Peninsula which led to the\ndeath of 34 and the injury of 105 Egyptian, Israeli and other foreigners, violates the victims' rights\nguaranteed under Articles 4, 5, 7(1) (a)(c) and 26 of the African Charter as alleged by the Complainants.\nThe summary of the rights allegedly violated by the Respondent State are viz:\n\n? The torture of the victims while in State custody, including electrical shocks, beatings, hanging from their\nhands and legs and prolonged sensory deprivation violates the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or\n15\n\n\fdegrading treatment enshrined in Article 5 of the Charter;\n\n? The denial of essential safeguards necessary to give effect to that prohibition, such as access to counsel,\ncourts and medical personnel, and the use in court of evidence obtained through torture, themselves\namount to a violation of Article 5 of the Charter;\n\n? The character, procedures and conduct of the Office of the State Security Prosecutor and of the Supreme\nState Security Emergency Court violate the victims' rights to due process under Article 7(1) of the Charter\nand the State's obligations to ensure the independence of the courts under Article 26;\n\n? The denial of fair trial rights and the imposition of the death penalty which would constitute a breach of\nthe right to life, as protected by Article 4 and 5 of the Charter.\n158. The Commission will accordingly proceed to analyze each of the Articles of the Charter alleged to\nhave been violated by the Respondent State\nAlleged Violation of Article 5\n\n159. The Complainants submit that the Respondent State violated Article 5 in that, the Victims were held\nincommunicado and denied access to their families, lawyers and medical care by SSI agents. They State\nthat they were beaten, tortured, blindfolded and occasionally hung from the ceiling by their arms and legs in\npainful positions by SSI agents who applied electrical shocks to several parts of their bodies.\n160. Article 5 of the African Charter, reads, \"Every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity\ninherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status. All forms of exploitation and\ndegradation particularly slavery, slave trade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and\ntreatment shall be prohibited.\nArticle 42 of the 1971 Constitution of Egypt stipulates that:\n\"any citizen arrested, detained or whose freedom is restricted shall be treated in a manner concomitant with\nthe preservation of his dignity. No physical or moral harm is to be inflicted upon him...\"84\n161. In order to analyse the allegation of torture by the Victims, the African Commission will look at what\namounts to torture in accordance with the Charter and other international instruments. Article 60 of the\nCharter has drawn inspiration from broader international law to deal with specific issues. Substantive\ninternational jurisprudence and practice has therefore developed in recent years regarding the nature of the\nprohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and the obligations of states to protect its\ncitizens against such treatment.\n162. Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel or Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (CAT) has defined\ntorture as: \"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted\non a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession,\npunishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or\nintimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when\nsuch pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public\nofficial or other person acting in an official capacity.\"85\n163. The African Commission will now seek to address issues as outlined in the submissions of the\nComplainants viz:\n(a) the Arab Republic of Egypt, through its State Security Intelligence force tortured and/or ill-treated the\nvictims; (b) the State, through its intelligence services, prosecutor's office and security court, denied the\nVictims the essential safeguards against torture and ill-treatment, including prompt access to counsel, to a\ncourt and to medical personnel, and has permitted the admissibility of \"confessions\" obtained through\ntorture in proceedings against them. (c) the State has failed to conduct an effective investigation into these\n16\n\n\falleged acts of torture and ill-treatment and no diligent attempts have been made to hold anyone to\naccount.\n164. The facts of torture as contained in the complaints is that the SSI agents subjected the victims to\nrepeated electrical shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging by the leg, binding and blindfolding aimed at their\ncomplete disorientation.\n165. The Respondent State on the other hand submit that the investigations carried out by the Public\nProsecutor established that it has conducted external check on the accused persons immediately when\nthey were brought before it and that it was confirmed that they were free from any external injuries. The\nquestion therefore that would follow is, who then inflicted the injuries that were subsequently found on the\nvictims?\n166. The victims' allegation is also consistent with the forensic reports which were eventually issued for\neach of the victims. The FMA report, following the examination of the First Victim on 5 July 2005, nearly\nnine months after his injuries were sustained, noted \"healings\" and \"dark discolorations\" on his right and left\nforearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint. The Second Report of the FMA of 27 May\n2006, following examination of the Second and Third Victim also nearly nine months after their torture,\nfound that the Second Victim had a \"darker intersecting discolorations\" all over his back, as well as an\nunhealed fracture in a left foot toe and that the Third Victim had dark discolorations in the chest, abdomen\nand upper arms.86 However, in both cases the government examiners concluded that the long time lapse\nbetween being examined and the injuries made it impossible to determine with certainty the reason,\nmanner or time of such injuries.\"87\n167. The question therefore that begs the mind is who then is responsible for the dark colorations found on\nthe bodies of the Victims? Certainly this could not have been inflicted by the Victims themselves, especially\nwhen it has been established that during all this time they were under the custody of the Respondent\nState's agents.\n168. It is a well established principle of international human rights law, that when a person is injured in\ndetention or while under the control of security forces, there is a strong presumption that the person was\nsubjected to torture or ill-treatment. As the European Court of Human Rights has recently noted: Where a\nperson is injured while in detention or otherwise under the control of the police, any such injury will give rise\nto a strong presumption that the person was subjected to ill-treatment [...]. It is incumbent on the State to\nprovide a plausible explanation of how the injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under\nArticle 3 of the Convention [...].88\n169. The African Commission wishes to state that under such circumstance, the burden now shifts to the\nRespondent State to convince this Commission that the allegations of torture raised by the Complainants is\nunfounded. The context of the Victims incommunicado detention and interrogation is such that available\nevidence is necessarily limited. However, the allegations of torture and ill-treatment are supported by the\nvictim's independent testimonies of similar ill-treatment. Their allegations fit also with the fact that they were\nheld incommunicado, hidden from the outside world during the 6-9 months of pre-trial detention, and that\naccess to medical professionals was persistently denied until during trial itself.\n170. In the present case, the Respondent State has made no attempt to give a satisfactory explanation of\nhow the injuries were sustained, or to take any steps to investigate and address the surrounding\ncircumstances. The trial court did nothing to follow up on questions raised in the FMA reports or the Victims'\ntestimonies.\n171. In the light of the above the African Commission concludes that the marks on the victims evidencing\nthe use of torture could only have been inflicted by the Respondent State.\n172. On the right to medical services, during detention, the African Commission and other international\nbodies have recognized and emphasizes that such rights be provided \"promptly\". The Human Rights\nCommittee, in its General Comment No. 20, has observed that protection of the detainee from torture and\nill-treatment requires \"prompt and regular access\" to doctors.89 The General Assembly has repeatedly\nunderlined the importance of the right to prompt medical examination promptly following detention to\nprevent abuse of detainees.\n173. In the presence of allegations or possible indications of abuse, the importance of prompt access to\nmedical personnel becomes all the more critical. The Istanbul Protocol, a set of detailed guidelines on the\ninvestigation of torture and ill-treatment elaborated by an independent group of experts in 1999, recalls that\n\"[t]he investigator should arrange for a medical examination of the alleged victim. The timeliness of such\nmedical examination is particularly important. A medical examination should be undertaken regardless of\nthe length of time since the torture, but if it is alleged to have happened within the past six weeks, such an\n17\n\n\fexamination should be arranged urgently before acute signs fade.\"90\n174. The Robben Island Guidelines in its section 20, urges State Parties to make sure that \"all persons\nwho are deprived of their liberty by public prder or authority should have that detention controlled by\nproperly and legally constituted regulations. Such regulations should provide a number of basic safeguard,\nall of which shall apply from the moment when they are first deprived of their liberty. These include:\na) The right that a relative or relative or other appropriate third person is notified of the detention;\nb) The right to an independent medical examination;\nc) The right of access to a lawyer; and\nd) Notification of the above rights in a language which the person deprived of their liberty understand. [sic]\n175. In the present case, the victims were not examined by doctors at any point during their pre-trial\ndetention. Even when they reported their torture and ill-treatment, they were still denied access to medical\npersonnel by the authorities.\n176. Only when the allegations of torture were made for the second time during the trial itself did the Judge\norder the examination of the Victims by the FMA. The forensic examination conducted by the authorities\nplainly did not satisfy the obligations set out above, as it was carried out more than 6 months after the\nVictims complained that they were subjected to torture and ill-treatment and was, therefore, ineffectual as a\nmethod of prevention or investigation.\n177. The African Commission therefore holds that the failure by the Respondent State to provide prompt\nmedical services to the victims whiles they were under detention violates the victims' rights to prompt\nmedical services whiles under custody.\n178. The African Commission also notes that the victims were denied counsel during their detention,\nincluding the critical interrogation sessions. In the Jamaican Case of Osbourne Wright and Eric Harvey v.\nJamaica, adopted on 27 October 1995, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has held that the\nrequirement that legal assistance must be made available to an accused faced with a capital crimes applies\nnot only to the trail and relevant appeals, but also to any preliminary hearing relating to the case.\n179. The African commission, therefore, notes that there is no disputed that the victims were unrepresented\nat the preliminary investigation stage, and notwithstanding the Respondents State's assertion that it is not\nthe responsibility of the State authorities to pay for such legal aid, it finds that it is axiomatic that legal\nassistance be available in capital cases, at all stages of the proceedings, especially when there were\nrequest from human rights lawyers to represent the victims. It should be understood by the Respondent\nState that there a positive obligation on them to provide access to independent legal assistance under the\nCharter, inherent in the international prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. The African Commission has\nrecognized the right to access to a lawyer as one of the \"basic procedural safeguards for those deprived of\ntheir liberty\"91 and as one of the necessary safeguards against abuse during the pre-trial process.92\n180. The link between the prevention of torture and the right to prompt access to a lawyer has likewise\nbeen emphasised by other international human rights bodies. In its Resolution 61/153 of 2007, reaffirming\nthe UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment,\nthe General Assembly stressed that permitting prompt and regular access to legal counsel constitutes an\n\"effective measure [...] for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and\npunishment.\"93 Similarly, the Human Rights Committee has stated that the protection of detainees from\ntorture and ill-treatment \"requires that prompt and regular access be given to [...] lawyers\"94 and that the\nuse of prolonged detention without any access to a lawyer violates a number of provisions of the Covenant,\nincluding Article 7.95\n181. Human rights bodies have thus recognized that, for access to a lawyer to constitute an effective\nprotection against torture and ill-treatment, such access has to be \"prompt\" and regular.96 For example the\nHuman Rights Committee has recommended \"that no one is held for more than 48 hours without access to\na lawyer\",97 whilst the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has clarified that \"[l]egal provisions prescribing\nthat a person shall be given access to a lawyer not later than 24 hours after he has been arrested usually\nfunction as an effective remedy against torture, provided compliance with such provisions is strictly\nmonitored.\"98\n182. Further, the right is to have access to a lawyer of one's choice, as recognized for instance in the UN\nBasic Principles on the Role of Lawyers.99 For the right to counsel to be meaningful it must also comprise\nthe right to timely, effective and confidentially communicate with counsel.\n183. In the instant matter, the obligation to permit access to counsel or independent legal advice was\nbreached, as detailed above. The African Commission is convinced that the Victims were not given access\n18\n\n\fduring the critical early stage of detention, including interrogation sessions, when there is the greatest risk\nof torture and ill-treatment. The African Commission's view is that right of a detainee to have prompt\nrecourse to a court is established as a matter of international law. It constitutes a vital aspect of the\nprevention and deterrence of torture and other ill-treatment.\n184. In this regard it is worth mentioning that in the Robben Island Guidelines, the African Commission has\nrecognized that the right to be brought promptly before a judicial authority constitutes an essential\nsafeguard against torture and ill-treatment,100 In its General Comment No. 2, the Committee Against\nTorture expressed the view that the obligation to take measures to ensure the effective prevention of torture\nimplied a requirement that States should ensure \"the availability to detainees and persons at risk of torture\nand ill-treatment of judicial and other remedies that will allow them to have their complaint promptly and\nimpartially examined, to defend their rights, and to challenge the legality of their detention or treatment.\"101\n185. This approach has been repeatedly endorsed by the General Assembly,102 and finds further support in\nthe jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.103\n186. As one of the inherent aspects of the protection of detainees from torture and ill-treatment, judicial\noversight of detention applies at all times, including times of national emergency, as noted by the\nInter-American Court:\n\"[...] even in emergency situations, the writ of habeas corpus may not be suspended or rendered\nineffective. [...] the immediate aim of this remedy is to bring the detainee before a judge, thus enabling the\nlatter to verify whether the detainee is still alive and whether or not he or she has been subjected to torture\nor physical or psychological abuse. The importance of this remedy cannot be overstated, considering that\nthe right to humane treatment recognized in Article 5 of the American Convention on Human Rights is one\nof the rights that may not be suspended under any circumstances.\"104\n187. In this case the Respondent States' obligation to bring the victims promptly to an independent judicial\nauthority was breached. While they did appear before a prosecutor, the right guaranteed in law is to bring\nthem before a judicial authority that is independent of the authorities detaining, interrogating and ultimately\nprosecuting them. They also had no meaningful opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of their detention,\ndue to lack of access to a court and to lawyers. Article 3 of the Emergency Law 50/1982 as amended,\nstipulates that detainees or their representatives may appeal their arrest or detention orders within 30 days\nafter the orders are issued. However, in practice detainees often have little access to the appeal provided\nfor in law. The victims had no access to lawyers neither were they arraigned before a competent court\nduring to properly remand them to custody\n188. The Respondent State, while arguing that the victims were allowed access to their families, failed to\nchallenge in specific terms the allegations that they were refused access to medical care. The allegation of\ntorture and more particularly the particulars of injuries sustained by the Victims as contained in the Forensic\nMedical Reports were never challenged by the Respondent State.\n189. The Respondent State has not refuted the allegations of torture or the harsh treatment to which the\nvictims were subjected to. The African Commission has in many of its decisions held that facts uncontested\nby the Respondent State shall be considered as established.105 The fact that the victims were subjected to\nrepeated electric shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging, binding and blindfolding and denied access to\nmedical care violates their physical and psychological integrity. There was also no evidence whatsoever\npointing to violent action from the victims themselves nor has there been any reported escape attempt by\nthe victims to warrant holding them in such degrading and inhuman manner.\n190. Article 5 prohibits not only torture, but also cruel inhuman or degrading treatment. This includes not\nonly actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering, but which humiliate the individual or\nforce him or her against his or her will or conscience. The African Commission therefore holds that the\naction of the Respondent State constitutes a multiple violation of Article 5 of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violations of Article 7 and 26\n\n191. The Complainants contend that the victims right to fair trial were violated in that;\n? they were tried by a Court that was not independent and impartial and whose decisions cannot be\nappealed;\n? their right to a counsel was not fully respected;\n19\n\n\f? confessions made under torture or ill-treatment were used by the Court; and\n? they were denied the right of appeal.\n192. The essential question that must be asked here is whether the trial of the Victims complied with the\nprovisions of Articles 7(1) and 26 of the African Charter.\n193. Article 7 of the African Charter provides that: \"Every individual shall have the right to have his cause\nheard. This comprises:\na) The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental rights as\nrecognized and guaranteed by the conventions, laws, regulations, and customs in force;\nb) The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\nc) The right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;\nd) The right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\n194. Article 26 on its part provides that: 'States Parties to the present Charter shall have the duty to\nguarantee the independence of the courts and shall allow the establishment and improvement of\nappropriate national institutions entrusted with the promotion and protection of the rights and freedoms\nguaranteed by the present Charter'.\n195. A combined reading of Articles 7 and 26 brings to the fore two core issues - having access to\nappropriate justice and the other relating to the independence of justice system. These two issues\nconstitute the bedrock of a sound justice delivery system. The African Commission believes that the right to\na fair trial is analogous with the concept of access to appropriate justice and requires that one's cause be\nheard by efficient and impartial courts106 .\n196. Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter enshrines \"the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an\nimpartial Court or tribunal.\" The requirement of impartiality in Article 7 is complemented by Article 26 of the\nAfrican Charter which imposes on States parties \"the duty to guarantee the independence of the Courts\" in\ntheir respective territories.\n197. These obligations are captured in the Commission's Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial where the\nCommission has expounded on what should be required for an independent and impartial tribunal. Among\nother criteria, the Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial state that:\n- judicial bodies shall be established by law to have adjudicative functions to determine matters within their\ncompetence on the basis of the rule of law and in accordance with proceedings conducted in the prescribed\nmanner;107\n- there should not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process nor shall\ndecisions be subject to revision except through judicial review;108\n- all judicial bodies shall be independent from the Executive branch109 and the government shall respect\nthat independence;110\n- the process of appointments to judicial bodies shall be transparent;111\n- the judicial body shall decide matters before it without any restrictions, improper influence, inducements,\npressure, threats or interference, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason.112\n198. Applying these fair trial principles to special tribunals, the African Commission has held that they\n\"violate Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter because their composition is at the discretion of the executive\nbranch.\n199. The victims were tried before the Supreme State Security Emergency Court, whose competence and\nprocedures fall far short of the above standards. The Supreme State Security Emergency Court is an\nexceptional court. It was established by the Emergency Law as a temporary court,113 although, like the\nEmergency Law itself, it has been in force continually since 1981. The Emergency Law gives the Court the\nprimary competence of ruling on crimes perpetrated in violation of decrees issued by the President of the\nRepublic in application of the Emergency Law,114 but the President of the Republic may also, at his\ndiscretion, refer any ordinary crime to the Supreme State Security Emergency Court.115 According to\nPresidential Decree 1/1981 regarding the referral of some crimes to Emergency State Security Courts, all\n20\n\n\ffelonies and misdemeanours against the Government's security or related to explosives shall be referred to\nthe State Security Emergency Courts, established under the Emergency Law.\n200. In view of the above, the African Commission is of the view that the degree of control which the\nPresident of the Republic exercises over the composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the\nState Security Court is antithetical to the notion of an independent and impartial judicial process. The law\nitself provides, for example, for the President to exercise the following powers:\n? The President may suspend a case before it is submitted to Supreme State Security Emergency Court or\norder the temporary release of the accused person before referral of the case to the Supreme State\nSecurity Emergency Court.116\n? Decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency Court are final only when they're approved by the\nPresident of the Republic, and cannot thereafter be challenged before any other court in Egypt.117\n? The President of the Republic may commute, change, suspend or cancel such decisions. He may also\norder the release of defendants118 or order the retrial of the case before another court.119\n201. It most [sic] be pointed out that Supreme State Security Emergence Court is not part of the regular\ncriminal court structure in Egypt. Sentences passed by this court can only be reviewed by the office\nresponsible for ratifying its judgments, office of the President of the Republic who is also the ratifying\nauthority. The ratifying authority which is not a court of law, may mitigate the sentence or repeal it and,\nonce the sentences are upheld the convicts may only petition the President for an amnesty or mitigation in\naccordance with the provisions of Article 149\n× Article 149 The President of Republic shall have the right of granting amnesty or commute a sentence.\nAs for general amnesty, it can only be granted by virtue of a law.\nof the Constitution.\n202. The Respondent State, however, submitted that the State of Emergency Security Court which tried the\naccused persons is a prosecuting court with limited functions according to the law and the objective criteria.\nThey further asserted that membership of this court comprises three experts (Judges who are members of\nthe judiciary. They also state that the trials and procedures in this case and in stages and phases were\ncarried out in public and in accordance with the law. It further argued that the criteria of fair trial adopted by\nthe international agreements on human rights were observed, and therefore, it is obvious from the above\nand from the records of the proceedings of the court trials that two lawyers appeared during all the hearings\ntogether with the first and the second accused persons and four lawyers representing the third complainant.\n203. From the submissions of the Respondent State, the African Commission of the view that the\nRespondent State does not appreciate the importance of an independent tribunal, especially one that is\nresponsible for trying victims charged with capital offences. The African Commission therefore reiterates\nthat the essence of a higher tribunal is that, it affords the victims the opportunity to have their case\nre-examined on both law and facts by a judicial body. In this way the decision of the court below can be\ntested. The omission of the opportunity of such an appeal therefore greatly deprives the victims of due\nprocess.\n204. In this regard the African Commission also wishes to make reference to the UN Basic Principle on the\nIndependence of the Judiciary. Those principles provide that every one shall have the right to be tried by\nthe ordinary courts or tribunals using established procedures. Tribunals that do not use the duly established\nprocedures of the legal process shall not be created to displace the jurisdiction belonging to the ordinary\ncourts or judicial tribunals. Therefore, it is the view of the African Commission that a tribunal cannot be said\nto be independent when the implementation of its decision squarely vests on the executive branch of the\nGovernment, in this case the Head of State. This has completely defeated the criteria envisaged in a\ndemocratic state.\n205. In Civil Liberties Organisation, and Others v Nigeria120 , the African Commission held that 'the\nforeclosure of any avenue of appeal to competent 63 national organs in a criminal case attracting\npunishment as severe as the death penalty clearly violates Article 7(1) (a)'. The African Commission\nagrees with the Complainants that the fact that the decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency\nCourts are not subject to appeal constitutes a de jure procedural irregularity and manifestly violates Article\n7(1) (a) of the African Charter.\n206. Therefore, the African Commission notes that in all cases, the independence of a court must be\njudged in relation to the degree of independence of the judiciary vis-?-vis the executive. This implies the\n21\n\n\fconsideration of the manner in which its members are appointed, the duration of their mandate, the\nexistence of protection against external pressures and the issue of real or perceived independence: as the\nsaying goes 'justice must not only be done: it must be seen to be done'.\n207. The African Commission is of the view that the degree of control which the President exercises over\nthe composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the State Security Court does not guarantee\nan independent and impartial judicial process. In its view that amounts to executive interference in the\njudicial process defeating the intent and purporse of Article 7(1) (d). The African Commission is therefore of\nthe view that the verdict of the Supreme State Security Emergency court did not offer guarantees of\nindependence, impartiality and equity and therefore constitutes a violation of the Article 7 of the African\nCharter.121\n208. In any event, it was the responsibility of the Respondent State to adduce sufficient evidence to rebut\nthe arguments that the court in its composition was independent and was capable of giving an impartial\nruling, and this the Respondent State has not done to the satisfaction of the African Commission. In the\nabsence of such rebuttal or facts that could convince the African Commission of the opposite view, it\ncannot invalidate the submission by the complainants regarding the inexistence of a fair justice system.\n209. The African Commission will look into the issue of the right to counsel of ones [sic] choice. This right\nas enshrined in Article 7(1) (c) of the African Charter122 is an important right which underpins several\nothers, such as freedom from ill-treatment and the right to prepare a defence.123 In the Principles and\nGuidelines on Fair Trial, the African Commission considered that in proceedings relating to criminal\ncharges, legal representation is the \"best means of legal defence against infringements of human rights\nand fundamental freedoms\".124 Such right to counsel applies during all stages of any criminal prosecution\n\"including preliminary investigations in which evidence is taken, periods of administrative detention, trial\nand appeal proceedings. Article 7 is explicit that the right is to counsel of the detainee or defendant's\nchoice. It comprises the right to timely and confidential consultations with that counsel.125 Where the\naccused either had no access, or only restricted or delayed access, to lawyers, the African Commission\nhas found a violation of Article 7.1(c)126 .\n210. In the instant case, none of the Victims had lawyers present at the critical early interrogation stage. It\nis submitted by the Complainants and not refuted by the Respondent State that on 23 November 2004 a\ngroup of human rights lawyers submitted a specific request to the Public Prosecutor's Office (registered\nunder number 16332) to legally represent a number of individuals, including the First Victim, whose names\nhad appeared in the local press as chief suspects in the Taba bombings' investigation. The lawyers\nreceived no response. The First Victim was denied representation at interrogations for a period of 5 months\nuntil 24 March 2005. The Second and Third Victims had no access to counsel until 26 March 2006, when\nthey first appeared in court.\n211. Moreover, even at the beginning of the trial, all three were denied the opportunity to consult with\ncounsel privately, in order to prepare their defence. The lawyer client communication, as alleged by the\nComplainants and not refuted by the Respondents, took place through bars of the court room, in the\npresence of and within earshot security officials. The African Commission therefore finds that the complete\ndenial of access to counsel before their appearance in court and the restrictive access thereafter violated\nthe right to counsel and the right to a defence (see below) under Article 7(1) (c).127\n212. Furthermore, in interpreting Article 7 of the African Charter, the African Commission has stated that\n\"any confession or other evidence obtained by any form of coercion or force may not be admitted as\nevidence or considered as probative of any fact at trial or in sentencing.\"128 In Malawi African Association\nV. Mauritania, this Commission has held that \"any confession or admission obtained during incommunicado\ndetention shall be considered to have been obtained by coercion.\"129\n213. These principles correspond with other international human rights norms, addressed in relation to\ntorture and ill-treatment, under which evidence and confessions obtained through torture or cruel, inhuman\nand degrading treatment, cannot be used in judicial proceedings apart from for the purpose of prosecuting\nthe act of torture or ill-treatment itself.130\n214. The African Commission makes reference to Article 15 of the Convention Against Torture (CAT). It\nalso notes that it has been accepted as inherent in international fair trial provisions comparable to Article 7\nof the African Charter. The European Court of Human Rights for example has held that \"the use of\nevidence obtained in violation of Article 3 [prohibition against torture or ill-treatment] in criminal proceedings\nraises serious issues as to the fairness of such proceedings. Incriminating evidence - whether in the form of\na confession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of\ntreatment which can be characterized as torture should never be relied on as proof of the victim's guilt,\n22\n\n\firrespective of its probative value.\"131\n215. It notes that the principle can also be found in the Egyptian Constitution of 1971 which stipulates that\n\"if a confession is proved to have been made by a person under any ...forms of duress or coercion, it shall\nbe considered invalid and futile\"132 .\n216. Thus, where an individual alleges that a confession has been obtained by torture or ill-treatment, the\nburden of proof then lies in this case on the state to demonstrate that the confession in question was freely\nmade. Although the Committee against Torture has affirmed in a number of cases that, \"it is for the author\nto demonstrate that her allegations are well founded\",133 it nevertheless stressed in P. E. v. France that, \"In\nthe light of the allegations that the statements at issue, which constituted, at least in part, the basis for the\nadditional extradition request, were obtained as a result of torture, the State party had the obligation to\nascertain the veracity of such allegations.\"134\n217. In a similar vein, the Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment, reviewing two national decisions that adopted a somewhat different approach to\nthe standard of proof question,135 noted as follows:\n\"[...] the applicant is only required to demonstrate that his or her allegations of torture are well founded. This\nmeans that the burden of proof to ascertain whether or not statements invoked as evidence in any\nproceedings, including extradition proceedings, have been made as a result of torture shifts to the State.136\n218. Accordingly, once a victim raises doubt as to whether particular evidence has been procured by\ntorture or ill-treatment, the evidence in question should not be admissible, unless the State is able to show\nthat there is no risk of torture or ill-treatment. Moreover, where a confession is obtained in the absence of\ncertain procedural guarantees against such abuse, for example during incommunicado detention, it should\nnot be admitted as evidence.\n219. The victims in this case all raised allegations of torture and ill-treatment. These allegations are at least\nconsistent with the circumstances of their case, such as the incommunicado nature of their detention and\nthe reports of the FMA which, at a minimum, indicate a risk of ill-treatment. Despite these concerns, the\n\"confessions\" were admitted as evidence and appear to have formed at least part of the basis of their\nconvictions and the imposition of the death penalty. The reliance on such evidence violates Article 7 of the\nCharter.\n220. The African Commission will now briefly address the matter of appeal. In this regard, the African\nCommission notes that Article 12 of the Egyptian Emergency Law stipulates that \"It is not allowed in any\nform to appeal the decisions pronounced by State Security Courts.\" This law, and its application in practice,\nviolate Article 7(1)(a) of the Charter, which provides for \"the right to an appeal to competent national organs\nagainst acts violating the fundamental rights as recognised and guaranteed by conventions, laws,\nregulations and customs in force.\"\n221. According to the Commission's Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial, the right to appeal should be\nguaranteed in all States Parties and should provide \"a genuine and timely review of the case, including the\nfacts and the law\".137 The Commission has noted that States Parties should take steps to make appeals\nmandatory in death penalty cases, confirming the heightened importance of fair trial guarantees where life\nis at stake.138\n222. The importance of appeal rights is also reflected in the Commission's jurisprudence. In Law Office of\nGhazi Suleiman v. Sudan, the Commission held that \"the fact that the decisions of the military Court [was]\nnot subject to appeal [...] constitute[d] a de jure procedural irregularity.\"139 Concerning the right to appeal in\ndeath penalty cases, the Commission found that \"the foreclosure of any avenue of appeal to competent\nnational organs in a criminal case attracting punishment as severe as the death penalty clearly violates\n[Article 7(1)(a) of the Charter].\"140\n223. By denying the victims the right to appeal the decision of the Supreme State Security Emergency\nCourt, the Arab Republic of Egypt has violated Article 7(1) (a) of the African Charter. It should be noted\nthat the imposition of the death penalty is not per se unlawful under the Charter or broader international\nhuman rights law.\n224. The African Commission therefore concludes that the victims' rights under Article 7 (1) (a), (b) and (c)\nof the African Charter including their right to appeal, were violated.\n225. The African Commission will now analyse the submissions of the parties on Article 4 of the Charter.\n226. The Complainants aver that the imposition of the death penalty on the victims by a court, whose\ncomposition is illegal and unconstitutional, such as the Supreme State Security Emergency Court, violates\nthe victims' right to life and would amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.\n23\n\n\f227. The Respondent State argues that trial as well as procedures adopted in this case satisfied the\nrequirement of fair trial as guaranteed by international norms and standard. They stated that the trials were\ncarried out in public and in accordance with the assurances provided by the law. They also state that the\nvictims were represented by lawyers of their choice during trial.\n228. Article 4 of the African Charter provides that 'human beings are inviolable. Every human being shall be\nentitled to respect for his life and the integrity of his person. No one shall be arbitrary deprived of this right'.\n229. The victims were charged, inter alia, under Article 86 b (ii) and (iii) of the Egyptian Penal Code. This\nlaw provides that the punishment for the crimes specified in those provisions is death penalty where \"the\naction of the offender leads to the death of the victim of the crime\"141 or \"the crime which occurred was the\nobject of the efforts or intelligence /contacts or involvement in committing it.\"142\n230. The above law imposes a penalty on a particular crime in specified circumstances but did not provide\nan avenue for a competent judiciary to evaluate the appropriate penalty, in light of all of the circumstances\nof the case. The penalty is effectively mandated by law for certain categories of offences, with the President\nempowered to decide not to apply that sentence if he so decides. This is at odds with the requirements of\nright to life, as reflected in international legal practice.\n231. The African Commission in the case of International Pen and Others (on behalf of Saro-Wiwa) v\nNigeria143 took the view that the execution and implementation of a death sentence emanating from a trial\nwhich did not conform to Article 7 of the African Charter will amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.\nHaving held that the trial of the applicants offended Article 7 of the African Charter, it follows that any\nimplementation of the death sentence imposed on the applicants by the Supreme State Security\nEmergency courts will therefore amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.\n232. However after careful consideration of Articles 7 and 26 and the wordings of Article 4, the African\nCommission is of the view that Article 4 of the Charter has not been violated. The victims are still under the\ncustody of the Respondent State, through a process that denied them due process and are not yet\nexecuted.\n\nHolding\n233. For these reasons, the African Commission holds as follows:\n(a) That the Respondent State - Republic of Egypt has violated the provisions of Articles 5, 7 (1) (a), (d)\nand 26 of the African Charter;\n(b) that there has been no violation of Article 4 of the African Charter;\n\nThe African Commission therefore calls on the Respondent State;\nI. Not to implement the death sentences;\nII. Calls on the Respondent State to adequately compensate the victims in line with international standard;\nIII. Reform the composition of the State Security Emergency Courts and ensure their independence;\nIV. Take measures to ensure that its law enforcement organs particularly the police respect the rights of\nsuspects detained in line with Article 5 of the Charter;\nV. Calls on the Respondent State to harmonize the State Security Emergency Laws with a view to bringing\nit in conformity with the Charter and other international legislations and regional norms and standards\nVI. Calls on the Respondent State to release the victims;\nVII. Calls on the Respondent State to submit the African Commission within 180 days from the date of\nreceipt of this decision (in line with Rule 112(2) of the African Commissions Rules of Procedure) on the\nmeasures taken to give effect to these recommendations.\n\nDone in Banjul this 9th Extra-Ordinary Session held From 23 February to 3 March 2011.\n\n24\n\n\fFootnotes\n*Editor's note: 87/93 is the number of a Constitution Rights Project v.

On 1st September 2004, the Secretariat of the African Commission received from the Complainants, a\nrequest to review the Commission's decision on the merits of Communication 242/2001 - Interights,\nInstitute for Human Rights and Development in Africa and Association Mauritanienne des Droits de\nl'Homme / Islamic Republic of Mauritania, adopted at the African Commission's 35th Ordinary Session, held\nin Banjul, The Gambia in May 2006.\n2. The request was considered at the 36th Ordinary Session of the Commission held in Dakar, Senegal,\nfrom 23rd November - 7th December 2006, and the Commission decided to bring the request to the\nattention of the Respondent State for the latter's comments. In spite of numerous reminders; the\nCommission has not received any response from the Respondent State. The Commission will therefore\nproceed to take a decision on the Complainants' request, in spite of the fact that the State has not\nresponded.\n3. In the request, the Complainants raised two issues: the first issue relates to the decision of the African\nCommission being infra petita, and the second issue relates to the fact that the decision of the Commission\n'did not represent the required guarantees of impartiality'.\n4. Regarding the first issue, the Complainants argue that having found the Respondent State in violation of\ncertain provisions of the African Charter, the African Commission failed to address itself to the prayers of\nthe Complainants, so as to restore the victim to his rights. According to the Complainants, this failure to\npronounce on the prayers renders the Commission's decision infra petita.\n5. On the question of impartiality, the Complainants submit that the principles of natural justice were not\nrespected. They claim that one of the Members of the African Commission, a national of the Respondent\nState, took part in the deliberations that arrived at the final decision on the Communication. According to\nthe Complainants, this is against Article 109 of the Rules of Procedures of the African Commission, which\nforbids Members of the Commission from participating in the deliberation of a Communication when they\nhave a \"personal interest\" or have \"participated in whatever capacity in the adoption of whatever decision\nrelating to the case referred to by the Communication\".\n6. To consider this request, the African Commission has to address two preliminary issues:\n• Whether or not it is competent to review its own decision; and\n• Under what circumstances its decision should be reviewed?\n\nOn the Competence of the Commission\n\n7. Neither the African Charter nor the Commission's own Rules of Procedure provide for a review of the\nAfrican Commission's decision on the merits. Provision is made within the Commission's Rules of\nProcedure only for the review of a decision on admissibility, and even then, only in a situation where a\ncommunication has been declared inadmissible.1\n8. This notwithstanding, the African Commission can draw inspiration from the practices of similar regional\nand international bodies to determine whether it can review its own decision. In Purohit & Moore v The\nGambia2 the Commission was confronted with a similar request and it invoked Articles 60 and 61 of the\nAfrican Charter, and adopted the principles and practices of other international tribunals with similar\nmandate. In that communication, the Commission was persuaded by the practices of the International\nCourt of Justice (ICJ), whereby Article 61(1) of the ICJ Statute requires that, 'an application for revision of a\njudgment may be made only when it is based upon the discovery of some fact of such a nature as to be a\n1\n\n\fdecisive factor, which fact was, when the judgment was given, unknown to the Court and also to the party\nclaiming review, always provided that such ignorance was not due to negligence'.3\n9. The African Commission further adopts the ICJ's reasoning that an application for revision must be made\nwithin a certain period of time.4\n10. Therefore, like all tribunals, domestic and international, judicial and quasi-judicial, the African\nCommission has the competence to review its decision on the merits, especially where it is evident that the\napplication for review has introduced a new or compelling issue which, had the Commission had knowledge\nof, would have impacted on the decision; or where the Commission has inadvertently failed to take into\naccount certain facts during the consideration of the case.\n11. In other words, the Commission can review its own decision when it is apparent that the application\nintroduces a new or compelling element, the failure to consider which would be an affront to fairness,\njustice and good conscience.\n12. After determining that it is competent to review its own decision and the circumstances under which it\ncan review its own decisions, the African Commission will now examine whether the application of the\nComplainants meet the African Commission's requirements for a review of its decision, that is, whether the\napplication introduces a new or compelling element.\n13. In the present communication, the Complainants have seized the Commission on two main issues:\n1. (a) allegation that the decision of the Commission was infra petita; and (b) allegation of partiality.\n14. Can the Commission consider these two issues to be new or compelling to warrant a review of its\ndecision?\n15. While the two issues raised by the Complainants do not raise any new element relating to the\nsubstance of the communication that they submitted, they certainly are compelling enough to warrant a\nreview.\nOn the question that the decision is infra petita\n\n16. The Complainants in their application for review are not raising new facts. They have also not\nintroduced evidence that was not brought to the attention of the African Commission during the\nconsideration of the communication on the merits. Rather they are asking the Commission to pronounce\nitself on each of the prayers they made when the communication was submitted to the Commission.\n17. The Complainants, in the communication, had requested the Commission that should the latter find the\nState in violation of any of the provisions of the African Charter, it should:\n• urge the State to restore all rights of the UFD/EN and instruct it to restore all confiscated properties;\n• request the Mauritanian authorities to harmonise national legislation in accordance with the relevant\nprovisions of the African Charter pertaining to fair trial and freedom of association and expression;\n• ask the Mauritanian government to take necessary measures to ensure that such violations against\npolitical parties not be repeated;\n• call on the State to put an end to such infractions; and\n• request the Mauritanian government to inform the Commission of any measures it takes to address\nthe breaches elaborated in the communication.\n18. In its decision, the African Commission held with respect to the allegations made against the State that\n\"the dissolution of UFD/Ere Nouvelle political party by the Respondent State was not proportionate to the\nnature of the breaches and offences committed by the political party and is therefore in violation of the\nprovisions of Article 10(1) of the African Charter\". The Commission did not pronounce itself on any of the\nprayers made by the Complainants.\n19. Does the fact that the Commission did not address the prayers of the Complainants make its decision\ninfra petita? Put differently, could the Commission's decision not to pronounce on the prayers made by the\nComplainants be considered infra petita?.\n\n2\n\n\fWhat is an infra petita decision?\n\n20. The term infra petita is a Latin expression sometimes used to describe a situation where the court has\nfailed to pronounce itself on one of the main claims of a petition. In terms of Article 190 (2)(c) of the Swiss\nFederal Statute on Private International Law (PILA), an arbitral award or remedy can be set aside if the\ntribunal has adjudicated beyond the relief sought (ultra petita) or granted relief different than what was\nsought (extra petita) or failed to adjudicate certain claims raised by the Complainant (infra petita).\n21. To fully appreciate whether the Commission's decision was infra petita, there is need to differentiate\nbetween an 'allegation' or 'claim' and a 'prayer' or 'remedy'.\n22. An allegation is a claim by a party in a pleading, which the party intends to prove in a court of law.\nAccording to the Black's Law Dictionary, an allegation is an assertion, claim, declaration or statement of a\nparty to an action, made in a pleading, setting out what he expects to prove. Allegations thus remain\nassertions without proof, until they can be proved. Generally, in a civil complaint, as is the present case, the\nplaintiff (in this case, the Complainants) must carry the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion in\norder to prove their allegation.\n23. In the present communication, the Complainants allege or claim that the Respondent State has violated\ncertain provisions of the Charter, which allegation/claim they want to prove before the Commission. Simply\nput, an allegation or a claim is a legal action to obtain a remedy, or the enforcement of a right against\nanother party. It is a legal statement made to alert the accused of the legal implications.\n24. A remedy on the other hand is an action taken by a court of law to enforce a right, impose a penalty, or\nmake some other court order in order to resolve a dispute. According to the Black's Law Dictionary, a\nremedy is the means by which a right is enforced or the violation of a right is prevented, redressed or\ncompensated.\n25. In the communication under consideration, the Complainants allege/claim that the Respondent State\nhas violated Articles 1, 2, 7(1), 9(1), 10(1), 13(1) and 14 of the African Charter, dealing with the State's\nobligations under the Charter, freedom from discrimination, the right to have one's cause heard, freedom of\nexpression, freedom of association, the right to participate in government and the right to property. These,\nin the opinion of the Commission, are the Complainants' allegations/claims put before the Commission,\nwhich the Complainants want to prove had been violated by the Respondent State and which they required\nthe Commission to pronounce itself on, based on the interpretation of the African Charter.\n26. Apart from making these allegations, the Complainants also called upon the Commission that, should it\nfind that they (the Complainants) have proven the allegations, it should adopt certain measures to reinstate\nthe victim to his rights, including, urging the Respondent State to restore all rights of the UFD/EN and\ninstruct it to restore all confiscated properties; requesting the Mauritanian authorities to harmonise national\nlegislation in accordance with the relevant provisions of the African Charter pertaining to fair trial and\nfreedom of association and expression; requesting the Mauritanian government to take necessary\nmeasures to ensure that such violation against political parties not repeat itself; call on the State to put an\nend to further violations; and requests the Mauritanian government to inform the Commission of measures\nit has taken to address the breaches elaborated in the Communication. In the opinion of the Commission,\nthe above requests represent the remedies sought by the Complainants.\n27. There is thus a clear distinction between an allegation/claim and a remedy/prayer. In the present\ncommunication, the Complainants are not disputing the fact that the Commission addressed the\nallegations. They are rather arguing that the Commission, having considered the allegations and found a\nviolation, did not provide them with the remedies they requested.\n28. Naturally, when a petitioner brings a complaint before a tribunal, he/she expects the tribunal to make a\ndetermination as to his/her rights vis-?-vis the other party (in this case the State). There is a legitimate\nexpectation on the part of the petitioner that where the tribunal (in this case, the African Commission) finds\nthat a State has violated the rights of the petitioner, he/she would be provided with remedies so as to\nrestore his/her rights; that the State would be cautioned to take measures to ensure that the act that\nresulted in the violation does not repeat itself; and the tribunal could make any other decision it deems\nnecessary in the particular circumstance. These are legitimate expectations from the Complainants.\n29. The right to a remedy for a violation has been firmly established under international law. This principle\nis provided in Article 63 (1) of the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights which provides that \"...if the\n[Inter-American Court] finds that there has been a violation of a right or freedom protected by the\nConvention, the Court shall rule that the injured party be ensured enjoyment of his right or freedom that\nwas violated. It shall also rule, if appropriate, that the consequences of the measure or situation that\n3\n\n\fconstituted the breach of such right or freedom be remedied and that fair compensation be paid to the\ninjured party\". In applying this provision, the Inter-American Court held in Yakye Axa v Paraguay5 that, \"any\nviolation of an international obligation that has caused damage entails the duty to provide appropriate\nreparations\".\n30. In the present communication, the Commission found that \"the dissolution of UFD/Ere nouvelle political\nparty by the Respondent State was not proportional to the nature of the breaches and offences committed\nby the political party and is therefore in violation of the provisions of Article 10(1) of the African Charter\". It\nmade no further determination, either by way of restoring the victim to his rights or proposing what the State\nshould do to prevent a recurrence of the violation.\n31. Does the fact that the Commission, after concluding that there was a violation of the Charter but failing\nto provide the remedies requested by the Complainants, renders its decision infra petita?\n32. To answer this question, the Commission will have to analyse the decision to examine the claims made\nby the Complainants and the extent to which the Commission addressed them.\n33. A tribunal will not be considered to have omitted to pronounce itself on a claim if it can be deduced from\nthe judgment that the claim was implicitly rejected, or on the contrary, that the tribunal implicitly admitted it.\nIt is usually the case for example, where a petition contains main, as well as, subsidiary claims.\n34. In the present communication, the allegation/claim of the Complainants before the Commission is clear\n- that by its action, the Respondent State has violated Articles 1, 2, 7(1), 9(2), 10(1), 13(1) and 14 of the\nCharter. These are mere allegations/claims which the Complainants have to prove before the Commission.\nAt the same time, the remedies the Complainants requested were also clear. (See para 17 above).\n35. After analysing the submissions made by both the Complainants and the State, the Commission held\nwith respect of the Complainants allegations/claims that Article 7(1) as alleged has not been violated (see\nCommissioner's arguments from paras 43-47 of the decision); that Articles 9(2), and 13(1) as alleged have\nequally not been violated; but that Article 10(1) has indeed been violated as alleged (see paras 76-85 of the\ndecision).\n36. In its analysis of the Complainants allegations/claims, the Commission failed to address three\nallegations/claims, that is, the alleged violation of Articles 1, 2 and 14, dealing with the state obligations\nunder the Charter, non-discrimination and the right to property, respectively.\n37. While it is important for the Commission to provide remedies to a victim whenever it finds that the State\nhas infringed the victim's right, failing to do so does not render the Commission's decision infra petita, if it\ncan be deduced from the decision that all the allegations mentioned in the communication have been\naddressed by the Commission.\n38. From the analysis above, it is evident that that the Commission failed to pronounce itself on all the\nallegations made by the Complainants, in particular, it failed to pronounce itself on the alleged violation of\nArticles 1, 2 and 14, the latter being a principal allegation. To the extent that the Commission did not\naddress all the allegations, the decision of the Commission is infra petita.\n39. Having established that the decision is infra petita, can the Commission supplement its decision? It is\nperfectly legal for a tribunal that has forgotten to decide on a claim (infra petita) to supplement its decision\nwithout affecting the res judicata character of the other claims decided upon. This procedure excludes\nrecourse to a higher court and can be undertaken suo moto or on the request of one of the parties. The\nCommission will therefore proceed to pronounce on the alleged violation of Articles 1, 2 and 14 of the\nCharter.\nAlleged violation of article 2\n\n40. The Complainants allege that there the Respondent State has violated Article2 of the African Charter.\nArticle 2 states that: \"Every individual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms\nrecognised and guaranteed in the present Charter without distinction of any kind such as race, ethnic\ngroup, colour, sex, language, religion, political or any other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth\nor any status\".\n41. The Complainants do not demonstrate how the Respondent State discriminated against the victim, and\nas such the Commission cannot hold that the State violated Article 2 of the Charter.\n\n4\n\n\fAlleged violation of Article 14\n\n42. The Complainants alleged that the State confiscated the property of the political party in violation of\nArticle 14 of the Charter which provides that '[t]he right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be\nencroached upon in the interest of public need or in the general interest of the community and in\naccordance with the provisions of appropriate laws'.\n43. The right to property is a traditional fundamental right in democratic and liberal societies. It is\nguaranteed in international human rights instruments as well as national constitutions, and has been\nestablished by the jurisprudence of the African Commission. 6 The role of the State is to respect and protect\nthis right against any form of encroachment, and to regulate the exercise of this right in order for it to be\naccessible to everyone, taking public interest into due consideration.\n44. The right to property encompasses two main principles. The first one is of a general nature. It provides\nfor the principle of ownership and peaceful enjoyment of property. The second principle provides for the\npossibility, and conditions of deprivation of the right to property. Article 14 of the Charter recognises that\nStates are in certain circumstances entitled, among other things, to control the use of property in\naccordance with the public or general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the\npurpose.\n45. However, in the situation described by the present Communication, the State has not demonstrated that\nthe property of the Complainant was confiscated for public interest or in accordance with any established\nlaw. The confiscation was done arbitrarily in a manner that violates Article 14 of the African Charter.\nAlleged violation of Article 1\n\n46. The African Commission concludes further that Article 1 of the African Charter imposes a general\nobligation on all State Parties to recognise the rights enshrined therein, and requires them to adopt\nmeasures to give effect to those rights. As such any finding of violation of those rights constitutes a\nviolation of Article 1.\nOn the question of partiality\n\n47. On the question relating to the participation of a Member of the Commission who is a national of the\nRespondent State, the Commission would like to reiterate that its Rule 109(1) requires that no Member\nshall take part in the consideration of a communication:\n• If s/he has any personal interest in the case, or\n• If he/she has participated, in any capacity in the adoption of any decision relating to the case which\nis the subject of the communication.\n48. Rule 109(2) further empowers the Commission to rule on the applicability of Rule 109(1) where it is\ncalled to do so.\n49. In the opinion of the African Commission 'take part' under Rule 109 (1) of its Rules of Procedure means\ncontributing in the deliberations of a subject matter. While it is recommended that a Commissioner who\nrecuses him/herself leaves the hall during deliberations, a Commissioner who recuses him/herself but\nchooses to sit in the hall cannot be considered to have taken part in the deliberations. In terms of Article 31,\nthe members are independent experts of the highest reputation, known for their high morality, integrity,\nimpartiality...and serve in their personal capacity. It is thus expected that Members of the Commission live\nup to the standards befitting their position.\n50. It is not necessarily the case that a Member of the Commission from a country against which a\ncomplaint has been lodged would have an interest in that particular case. However, it is important to take\ninto consideration the public perception or adopt the principle of a reasonable person in the consideration of\na communication. Would the public or a reasonable man believe that a member of the Commission would\n'take part' in the deliberation of a communication concerning his country and take a neutral decision?\n51. The African Commission adheres strictly to the natural justice principle of nemo judex in sua causa: \"no\nman is permitted to be a judge in his own cause\". This principle is very critical in the administration of\njustice, for justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done.\n52. The use of the word 'shall' in Rule 109 implies that the Commission would not compromise in the\nimplementation of this principle. In the Complainants' submissions, they quoted paragraphs 2 and 17 of the\n5\n\n\fFinal Communiqué of the 35th Ordinary Session of the African Commission to buttress their argument that a\nCommissioner, a national from the Respondent State, took part during deliberations of the communication\nin question.\n53. In terms of Rule 106 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure, communications are examined in private\nsession and the Complainants could not have been privy to what transpired during the examination of the\nCommunication in question.\n54. The African Commission's records indicate that the Commissioner in question did not take part in the\ndeliberations of the present Communication.\n55. The burden of proving that he did rests with the Complainants. Under such circumstances, and relying\non the presumption of regularity, it is presumed that the Commission complied with its procedures under\nRule 109.\n56. In terms of the presumption of regularity, there is a favourable presumption that all what the\nCommission does in the normal course of its duty is regular and valid. This evidentiary principle which has\nits historical roots in the presumption against misconduct of public officials, presupposes that every\nindividual in his or her private and official capacity, does his or her duty, until the contrary is proved. In other\nwords, it will be presumed that government officials (in this case, the Members of the Commission) have\ndischarged their duty rightly and in good faith, unless the circumstances of the case provide adequate proof\nto the contrary\n57. To overturn this presumption, the party that seeks to challenge the presumption, and in this case,\nalleges that the Commission did not comply with its Rules, bears the burden of proof.\n58. The Commission noted in this instance that the fact that the name of the Commissioner, a national of\nthe Respondent State, appeared in the Final Communiqué of the Commission does not signify that the\nlatter took part in the proceedings regarding the communication in question, in violation of Rule 109. The\nComplainants therefore have the burden to prove that the spirit and object of Rule 109 have been\nbreached. The only evidence that the Complainants adduced was the reference to the 2nd paragraph of the\nFinal Communiqué of the 35th Ordinary session of the Commission which indicated that the Commissioner\nwas one of the members that attended that session.\n59. In terms of the Commission's practice, the Final Communiqué lists the names of the members who\nattend a particular session. The Communiqué however does not indicate which members took part in the\ndeliberations of which any particular agenda item. In this case, the name of the Commissioner in question,\nlike the names of all the other Members who attended the session, was indicated in the Final Communiqué\nof the session. This does not however mean that he took part in the deliberations with respect to the\ncommunication in question.\n60. Admittedly, the Complainants could have been misled by the Final Communiqué to assume that all the\nmembers who attended the session also took part in deliberations on all the agenda items, especially as\nthe Final Communiqué did not indicate whether or not any member recused themselves on any particular\nitem.\n61. The African Commission is very strict in its application of its Rules of Procedure, and in particular, Rule\n109, and with respect to the said Rule, its application is not limited to the consideration of Communications,\nbut extends to all items considered by the Commission.\n62. The Commission is therefore of the view that the Complainants have not fully discharged their burden\nof proof, and to state that the Commissioner, a national of the Respondent State did not take part in the\nconsideration of the communication in question, and his participation at the session is not proof that he\nparticipated in the deliberation related to this Communication.\n\nDecision of the African Commission\n63. In view of the above, the Commission finds that:\ni the decision on the merits of Communication 242/2001 -Interights, Institute for Human Rights and\nDevelopment in Africa, and Association Mauritanienne des Droits de l'Homme/Islamic Republic of\nMauritania is infra petita, to the extent that it did not address itself to the allegation of violations of Articles 1,\n2 and 14 of the African Charter;\nii the Respondent State did not violate Article 2 of the African Charter;\niii the Respondent State violated Articles 1 and 14 of the African Charter;\niv the Complainants have not discharged their burden of proof with respect to the allegation of partiality,\nand relying on the presumption of regularity, concludes that the Commission acted correctly and in good\n6\n\n\ffaith.\n64. The African Commission recommends that:\n1. the Respondent State should pay adequate compensation to the victim for the loss suffered;\n2. the Respondent State should take steps to ensure that its law on freedom of association, in\nparticular the establishment and functioning of political parties, is in conformity with the provisions of\nthe Charter;\n3. the Respondent State should inform the African Commission on measures adopted to implement\nthese recommendations within 180 days of receipt of this decision.\n\nAdopted at the 8th Extraordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples'\nRights, Banjul, The Gambia.\n\nFootnotes\n1 See Rule 118(2)\n2 Communication 241/2001.\n3 Statute of the International Court of Justice.

The Complainant, Michael Majuru (hereinafter called the Complainant), submitted this communication\nagainst the Republic of Zimbabwe, (hereinafter called the Respondent State), a State Party to the African\nCharter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the African Charter). The Complainant is a citizen of the\nRespondent State and is currently residing in the Republic of South Africa.\n2. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State has committed gross violations of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms against him through acts committed by the Minister of Justice, Legal and\nParliamentary Affairs and the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) under the Office of the President and\nCabinet.\n3. The Complainant alleges further that in committing the gross violations, the aforementioned\norganisations, individuals and organs of the state were acting in the course and scope of their employment\nas Respondent State's agents.\n4. The Complainant submits further that his rights were abused because of his role as a presiding judge in\na case in which the Associated Newspaper Group of Zimbabwe (ANZ), a publishing house in the\nRespondent State, sought to challenge, before the Administrative Court, the Respondent State's act on\nbanning ANZ from publishing its two newspapers, the Daily News and the Daily News on Sunday. The\nmatter was lodged before the Administrative Court on or about 23rd September 2003 and he presided over\nthe matter.\n5. The Complainant states that following his decision in favour of the ANZ, he became a target of human\nrights abuses brought upon him by agents of the Respondent State and recounts the chronology of events\nthat depict incidents in which the Respondent State allegedly violated his human rights.\n6. The first incident is reported to have occurred on or about 24th September 2003. It is alleged that the\nMinister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, the Hon. Patrick Chinamasa invited the Complainant's\nworkmate, who was also a judge at the Administrative Court (Justice Chipo Machaka) to his office to issue\ninstructions that the matter relating to the ANZ case that was to be presided over by the Complainant\nshould be conducted in a manner that the said Minister was going to dictate. Justice Machaka was\ninstructed by the Minister to convey these instructions to the Complainant, with an order that Complainant\nshould comply with such orders.\n7. It is further alleged that the Minister also instructed that the Administrative Court should delay the court\nproceedings until February 2004, noting that the ANZ did not deserve impartial treatment by the Judiciary\nbecause it was a front of western nations and 'other imperialists'. Secondly, Justice Machaka is alleged to\nhave been told that if the ANZ were granted its application for urgent appeal hearing and thereafter allowed\npublication at that stage this would jeopardise continuing negotiations between ZANU PF and the\nMovement for Democratic Change (MDC), (the biggest opposition party in Zimbabwe), which according to\nthe Minister, had reached a delicate stage. As proof of this delicate relationship between ZANU PF and\nMDC, Justice Machaka was shown a draft constitution agreed upon between the two parties and some\nother supporting documents.\n8. The Complainant submits that the he disregarded the aforesaid instructions and upon considering the\nANZ's application on its merits ruled in favour of the ANZ by granting the application for an urgent appeal\nhearing on or about 27th September 2003. From 15th to 19th October 2003, the Complainant presided over\nthe appeal hearing between the two parties. He adjourned the matter for judgement to 24th October 2003.\n9. Subsequently, the Complainant states that he was summoned by Enoch Kamushinda, a suspected\nmember of the CIO for a meeting at Kamushinda's office on 22nd October 2003. This information was\nconveyed through another CIO operative with instructions that the Complainant should dismiss the ANZ\nappeal. As a reward for dismissing the ANZ appeal, Kamushinda promised the Complainant a fully\ndeveloped farm in Mashonaland West Province.\n10. The Complainant further states that on 23rd October 2003 at around 21:00 hours, the Minister of\nJustice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Hon. Patrick Chinamasa, telephoned and enquired from the\nComplainant whether he had finalised the judgement in the ANZ matter and what decision he had reached.\nThe Complainant advised him that he was in the process of finalising the judgement and that he was going\nto allow the appeal. The Complainant states that the Minister expressed his displeasure with the said\ndecision and further attempted to unduly influence and/or threaten the Complainant.\n1\n\n\f11. The Complainant claims that he went ahead to deliver the judgement in favour of ANZ at about 1600\nhours on 24rd November 2003. Subsequently, at about 21:30 hours, Hon. Chinamasa in an angry\ntelephone call to the Complainant, accused the latter of pre-determining the matter and berated him for\ndelivering a judgement dictated by British agents and other imperialist forces.\n12. Subsequently, the Media and Information Commission (MIC) appealed to the Supreme Court against\nthe decision of the Administrative Court. ANZ on the other hand decided to approach the Administrative\nCourt seeking an order that its original decision be rendered operative notwithstanding the institution of an\nappeal by the MIC.\n13. The Complainant claims that upon the lodging of this application by the ANZ, the Complainant was\nplaced under immense pressure from agents of the Respondent State urging him to desist from dealing\nwith the matter. The Complainant claims that the Respondent sent members of the CIO to track, trial and\nmonitor the Complainant's movements and interactions with other people.\n14. The Complainant alleges that on several occasions he was approached by Ben Chisvo, a suspected\nCIO informer, a former ruling ZANU PF Councillor of the City of Harare and also a war veteran. Chisvo\nsought to persuade the Complainant to rescue himself from presiding over the matter, claiming that the\ncase was serious and sensitive and that President Mugabe did not want the ANZ to be registered. Chisvo\nfurther indicated that the President had set up a team led by a senior assistant commissioner of Zimbabwe,\nChangara, to monitor the proceedings in the ANZ matter and confirmed that the Complainant was being\nmonitored by state security agents.\n15. On 23rd November 2003, at around 23:00 hours, the Complainant received a telephone call from\nChisvo in which he claimed that his car had had a puncture close to the Complainant's residence and\nrequested for assistance. Upon meeting the Complainant, Chisvo demanded to know whether the former\nwould preside over the ANZ matter or excuse him as previously ordered. The Complainant informed Chisvo\nthat he would be presiding over the ANZ matter.\n16. The Complainant further alleges that, on 24th November 2003, following the Complainant's\npostponement on the ANZ matter upon the request of the two parties to the case, he received a telephone\ncall from Hon. Chinamasa at around 21:00 hours. The Complainant states that the Minister alleged that he\nhad information linking the Complainant to British agents and other imperialists and that the Complainant\nwas under investigation for these alleged links with the British agents and imperialists. The Minister also\nindicated that he was aware through his informants that the ANZ was going to succeed in the second\nmatter which was pending before the Complainant and advised him that the Minister of Justice had also\nphoned her ordering her to meet him at his office the following morning. She informed the Complainant that\nthe Minister wanted to be advised on how the Complainant intended to decide the ANZ matter in order for\nhim to brief the Cabinet that morning. Soon after the telephone call from Justice Machaka, the Minister\ntelephoned the Complainant once again ordering that they meet the following morning at his office at 08:00\nhours.\n17. On 25th November 2003, the Complainant met with the Minister as instructed. The Minister wanted to\nknow what the Complainant's decision in the ANZ matter would be but the Complainant declined to inform\nstating that he had not yet heard the parties' arguments on the matter and was therefore in no position to\nknow the outcome. The Complainant alleges that the Minister informed him that the Police Commissioner\nAugustine Chuchuri had approached him previous night with information that the Complainant was under\ninvestigation for colluding with British agents over the ANZ matter and was considering arresting him.\n18. The Minister is also reported to have shown the Complainant the Herald newspaper which carried an\narticle on its front page alleging that the Complainant was under probe over the ANZ matter. The Minister\nalso produced an affidavit, which he said had been obtained from Chisvo by the Police Commissioner. In\nthe said affidavit, Chisvo had made statements to the effect that the Complainant had informed Chisvo that\nthe ANZ matter was predetermined.\n19. The Complainant claims that as a result of such sustained and relentless pressure he had no other\noption but to excuse himself from the matter. Notwithstanding the recusal, the Complainant remained under\nsurveillance by state security agents.\n20. The Complainant states that on 1st December 2003, he received a telephone call from a member of the\nlegal fraternity and the Police informing him that the Respondent State was fabricating a case against him\nand that he was to be arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for defying the\nRespondent's orders.\n21. The Complainant alleges that fearing for his safety and security; he decided to go into hiding until 9th\nDecember when he fled to South Africa, where he remains in exile.\n2\n\n\f22. The Complainant submits that he is not the only member of the Judiciary who has been persecuted but\nthat there is a systematic, consistent and sustained pattern of interference with the Judiciary by the\nExecutive in the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\nComplaint\n23. The Complainants allege that Articles 3, 5, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 26 of the African Charter on Human\nand Peoples' Rights have been violated.\n24. The Complainant requests that the African Commission should:1. Urge the Respondent State to institute an inquiry and investigation that should result in the\nGovernment of Zimbabwe bringing those who perpetrated the violations to justice;\n2. Order the Respondent State to pay compensation for the physical pain, psychological trauma, loss\nof earnings and job and access to family suffered by the Complainant.\n\nProcedure\n25. The Communication is dated 2th November 2005 and was sent by email to the Secretariat, and was\nreceived on 8th November 2005.\n26. On 17th November 2005, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Communication and informed the\nComplainant that the communication would be scheduled for consideration by the African Commission at\nits 38th Ordinary Session.\n27. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the\nAfrican Commission considered the communication and decided to be seized of it.\n28. By Note Verbale dated 8th December 2005, the Secretariat transmitted a copy of the communication to\nthe Respondent State by DHL and requested it to forward its submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\nThe Complainant was also requested to send his submissions on admissibility within 3 months.\n29. By letter and Note Verbale dated 20th March 2006, the parties to the communication were reminded to\nforward their written submissions on admissibility of the communication.\n30. On 3rd April 2006, the Secretariat received submissions on admissibility of the communication from one\nGabriel Shumba. By letter dated 12th April 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to Gabriel\nShumba informing him that the communication had been brought before the African Commission by\nMichael Majuru who had never made any indication to the African Commission that Gabriel Shumba could\nmake representations on his behalf. This letter was also copied to the Complainant Michael Majuru.\n31. As at the 40th Ordinary Session there had been no reply from the Complainant. The communication\nwas therefore deferred to the 41st Ordinary Session pending the reply of the Complainant and Mr Shumba,\nas well as the Respondent State's submission on admissibility.\n32. By letter and Note Verbale dated 11th December 2006, written to the Complainant and Respondent\nState respectively, the parties were informed by the Secretariat, about the decision of the African\nCommission during its 40th Session, to consider the admissibility of the communication during its 41st\nSession. The parties were asked to send their submissions on admissibility within 3 months of receiving the\nletters.\n33. The Complainant sent an email on 18th December 2006, confirming that Zimbabwe Exiles Forum to\nwhich Gabriel Shumba is the Executive Director are his agents in the matter and that the Secretariat should\nacknowledge submissions made by them.\n34. By Note Verbale dated 4th January 2007, the Secretariat reminded the Respondent State of the\nCommission's decision during its 40th Ordinary Session, and asked them to make their submissions on\nadmissibility within 3 months of receipt of the notification. Another reminder by way of a Note Verbale dated\n10th April 2007 was also sent to the Respondent State.\n35. On 24th April 2007, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submission on admissibility. The\nRespondent State's submission was forwarded to the Complainant by email and he was asked to make\nadditional submissions (if any), in order to address some important points which were raised by the\nRespondent State in its submission.\n\n3\n\n\f36. During its 41st Ordinary Session, the African Commission decided to defer consideration of the\ncommunication to its 42nd Ordinary Session for its decision on admissibility.\n37. By letter ACHPR/LPROT/COMM/308/2005/ZIM/TN dated 20th July 2007 and by Note Verbale\nACHPR/LPROT/COMM/308/2005/ZIM/RE, with the same date, the parties were informed of the decision of\nthe African Commission to defer consideration of the communication to its 42th Ordinary Session.\n38. At its 42nd Ordinary session held in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, the Commission considered this\ncommunication and decided to defer further consideration into the 43rd Ordinary Session due to lack of\ntime.\n39. By Note Verbale of 19th December 2007 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat of the Commission\nnotified both panics of the Commission's decision.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\nComplainant's submission on admissibility\n\n40. The Complainant submitted that he has local standing before the African Commission as the\ncommunication is brought by himself, a citizen of Zimbabwe, the Respondent State in this matter.\nRegarding compatibility, the Complainant submitted that the communication raises a prima facie violation of\nthe African Charter committed by the Respondent State. He submitted further that the evidence he has\nsubmitted reveals that the communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated by the mass\nmedia, adding that it is based on first hand evidence - including reports by reputable human rights\norganisations.\n41. On the exhaustion of local remedies, the Complainant submitted that the onus is on the State to\ndemonstrate that remedies are available, citing the Commission's decisions in the cases of 71.921 and\n147.95-149.96,2 . The Complainant added that he remedy in his particular circumstance is not available\nbecause he cannot make use of it that he was forced to flee Zimbabwe for fear of his life and that of his\nimmediate family. Because of his work as a judge of the Administrative Court. That he fled to the Republic\nof South Africa following threats of arrest and unspecified harm by the Respondent State.\n42. The Complainant drew the Commission's attention to its decision on 215.983 , where the Commission\nheld that a Complainant's inability to pursue local remedies following his flight for fear of his life to Benin,\nand was subsequently granted asylum was sufficient to establish a standard for constructive exhaustion of\nlocal remedies. He concluded by noting that considering the fact that he was no longer in the Respondent\nState's ternary where remedies could be sought. And that he fled the country against his will due to threat\nto his life; remedies could not be pursued without impediments.\n43. The Complainant also challenged the effectiveness of the remedies noting that remedies are effective\nonly where they offer a prospect of success. He claimed the Respondent State's reaction to court rulings\nthat go against it is well documented by reputable international and African NGOs, noting that the\nRespondent State treats court rulings that go against it with indifference and disfavour, and that he does\nnot expect that in his case, any decision of the court would be adhered to. He said there was a tendency in\nthe Respondent State to ignore court rulings that went against it and added that the Zimbabwe Lawyers for\nHuman Rights had documented at least 12 instances where the State had ignored court rulings since 2000.\nHe cited the ruling of the High Court in the Commercial Farmers Union, the Mark Chavunduka and Ray\nChoto cases, where, in the latter case, the duo were allegedly abducted and tortured by the army. He\nconcluded that given the prevailing circumstances and the nature of his complaint and the Respondent\nState's well publicised practice of non-enforcement of court decisions, his case had no prospect of success\nif local remedies were pursued and according to him, not worth pursuing. Finally, the Complainant\nsubmitted that he could not have exhausted local remedies as any such exhaustion would have to comply\nwith the States Liabilities Act which prevents the Complainant from suing the Respondent State after the\nexpiration of two months of the date of the incident complained of, no prior notice has been given.\n44. The Complainant further submitted that the communication was submitted 22 months after the violation\nbecause he hoped that the situation in the country would improve to enable him utilise domestic remedies.\nHe said there is instead a deterioration of the situation and hope of improvement is highly unlikely in the\nnear future, adding that \"continuing to wait whilst the Complainant is undergoing tremendous psychological\ntorture and suffering attributable to his persecution will undoubted cause irreparable harm\". The\n4\n\n\fComplainant added that since he fled to South Africa he has been undergoing psycho-therapy and was not\nin a position to submit his communication to the Commission.\n45. The Complainant indicated other reasons that prevented him from submitting his complaint on time,\nincluding the fact that the judiciary abides by a code of conduct in terms of which they do not ordinarily\nspeak out and take positions against the establishment, noting that out of eight or so members who have\nleft Zimbabwe because of persecution, he is the only one who was speaking out. He added that he was\nafraid for the lives of members of his immediate family that were at risk of persecution because of him and\nthat he was unable to submit immediately for want of resources and facilities, noting that the submission\nwas made possible through the assistance and support of well wishers.\n46. Finally, Complainant further submitted that the communication had not been before any other\ninternational body for settlement as required by Article 56(7).\nRespondent State's submission on admissibility\n\n47. The Respondent State briefly restated the facts of the communication and indicated that it will attend to\nthe matters of fact, pertaining to the complaint \"in order to put the communication in proper perspective\".\nThe State submitted that the Complainant was appointed to the Office of Administrative Court President in\nterms of Section 79\n× 79 Judicial authority (1) The judicial authority of Zimbabwe shall vest in-- (a) the Supreme Court; and (b)\nthe High Court; and (c) such other courts subordinate to the Supreme Court and the High Court as may be\nestablished by or under an Act of Parliament. (2) The provisions of subsection (1) shall not be construed as\npreventing an Act of Parliament from-- (a) vesting adjudicating functions in a person or authority other than\na court referred to in subsection (1); or (b) vesting functions other than adjudicating functions in a court\nreferred to in subsection (1) or in a member of the judiciary. [Section as substituted by section 10 of Act 30\nof 1990 - Amendment No. 11] 79A Judiciary\nThe judiciary of Zimbabwe shall consist of-- (a) the Chief Justice, who shall be the head of the judiciary;\nand (b) the judges of the Supreme Court; and (c) the Judge President and the other judges of the High\nCourt; and\n(d) persons presiding over other courts subordinate to the Supreme Court and the High Court that are\nestablished by or under an Act of Parliament. [Section as inserted by section 10 of Act 30 of 1990 Amendment No. 11] 79B Independence of judiciary\nIn the exercise of his judicial authority, a member of the judiciary shall not be subject to the direction or\ncontrol of any person or authority, except to the extent that a written law may place him under the direction\nor control of another member of the judiciary. [Section as inserted by section 10 of Act 30 of 1990 Amendment No. 11]\nof the Constitution at Zimbabwe, read together with the Administrative Court Act. The State added that\nwhile performing his functions as a Magistrate, Presidents of the Administrative Court are not judges, noting\nthat in essence, the Complainant was not a judge.\n48. According to the State, the Complainant was supposed to be in a court in Bulawayo, but due to his poor\nhealth and his relationship with the Minister of Justice, he was appointed to the Administrative Court in\nHarare. The State noted that Complainant was a sick man throughout his whole duration at the court and\nadded that \"in fact from the time of his appointment as a Court President, the Complainant used to travel to\nSouth Africa to seek medical attention\".\n49. The State claims that Complainant applied for two weeks vacation from 9th to 31st December 2003 and\nwent to South Africa for medical attention. That he then tendered his resignation on 14th January 2004. The\nState observed that even though the letter has a Zimbabwean address, an examination of the delivery slip\nshowed that it had been dispatched from South Africa. The State concluded that the above circumstances\nwhich show how Complainant left the country do not amount to forced flight as he claims.\n50. The State questioned why Complainant would take steps to regularise his absence from office by\napplying for vacation leave and tender his resignation to the Minister who was threatening him. Without\nproducing any document title, the State added that it is apparent from the documents available that he was\nmaintaining dialogue with a government which he claims was persecuting him. The State observed further\nthat the letter of resignation even showed the address Complainant was residing and \"assuming the\ngovernment of Zimbabwe really wanted his life, it would have used the address he had volunteered to track\nhim\". The State concluded by stating that the truth is that [the] \"Complainant was never threatened by\n5\n\n\fanyone, anywhere both within and outside Zimbabwe\".\n51. On the admissibility of the communication, the State argued that the communication be declared\ninadmissible for non-compliance with the provisions of Articles 56(2), (5) and (6) of the Charter.\n52. The State argued that the communication is not compatible as required by Article 56(2) of the Charter,\nas it makes general allegations without substantiating, adding that, for a complaint to be compatible with\nthe Charter or the Constitutive Act, it must prove a prima facie violation of the Charter. According to the\nState, the facts raised in the communication do not raise any violation of the Charter, noting that \"basically\nthe facts and issues in dispute do not fall within the rationae personae of the jurisdiction of the\nCommission\".\n53. On the exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56(5), the State submitted that local remedies were\navailable to the Complainant, citing section 24\n× 24 Enforcement of protective provisions (1) If any person alleges that the Declaration of Rights has been,\nis being or is likely to be contravened in relation to him (or, in the case of a person who is detained, if any\nother person alleges such a contravention in relation to the detained person), then, without prejudice to any\nother action with respect to the same matter which is lawfully available, that person (or that other person)\nmay, subject to the provisions of subsection (3), apply to the Supreme Court for redress. [Subsection as\namended by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10] (2) If in any proceedings in the High Court or\nin any court subordinate to the High Court any question arises as to the contravention of the Declaration of\nRights, the person presiding in that court may, and if so requested by any party to the proceedings shall,\nrefer the question to the Supreme Court unless, in his opinion, the raising of the question is merely frivolous\nor vexatious. [Subsection as amended by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10] (3) Where in\nany proceedings such as are mentioned in subsection (2) any such question as is therein mentioned is not\nreferred to the Supreme Court, then, without prejudice to the right to raise that question on any appeal from\nthe determination of the court in those proceedings, no application for the determination of that question\nshall lie to the Supreme Court under subsection (1).

[Subsection as amended by section 13 of Act 25 of 1981 - Amendment No. 2]\nof the Constitution of Zimbabwe which provides the course of action to be taken where there is human\nrights violation. The State added that there is no evidence to prove that the Complainant pursued local\nremedies. The State further indicated that in terms of Zimbabwe law, where one is engaged in acts that\nviolate the rights of another person, that other person can obtain an interdict from the court restraining the\nviolator from such act.\n54. On the effectiveness of the remedies, the State submitted that the Constitution provides for the\nindependence of the judiciary in the exercise of its mandate in conformity with both the UN Principles on an\nIndependent Judiciary and the African Commission's Guidelines on the Right to Fair Trial.\n55. The State dismissed the Complainant's argument that his case is similar to those brought by Sir Dawda\nJawara / The Gambia and Rights International (on behalf of Charles Baridorn Wiwa) / Nigeria, adding that\nin the latter cases, there was proof of real threat to life, the State went further to indicate instances where\nthe government has implemented court decisions that went against it.\n56. The State further indicated that in terms of Zimbabwe law, it is not a legal requirement for a\nComplainant to be physically present in the country in order to access local remedies, adding that both the\nHigh Court Act and the Supreme Court Act permit any person to make an application to either court through\nhis/her lawyer. The State added that in the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka case, the victims were\ntortured by State agents and they applied for compensation while they were both in the United Kingdom\nand succeeded in their claim. The State concluded that the Complainant is not barred from pursuing\nremedies in a similar manner.\n57. The State further submitted that since his resignation, the government of Zimbabwe continues to pay\nthe Complainant his pension benefits and argued that the excuse raised by the Complainant of lack of\nresources to enable him submit his complaint on time is therefore without merit adding that he could have\ninstructed his counsel in Zimbabwe to attend to his claim on his behalf.\n58. According to the State, the Complainant sought to mislead the Commission by claiming that under the\nState Liabilities Act, claims against the State are prescribed within a period of sixty days. The State\nindicated that section 6 of the Act is clear that the sixty days is in respect of a notice of intention to sue. The\nAct prescribes that a summons against [the] State in certain matters must be delivered sixty days after the\nnotice of intention to sue, and according to the State, this would actually work well for the Complainant,\nadding that the period of proscription of claims is three years and Complainant's claim was not yet three\nyears and thus not prescribed.\n59. The State also submitted that the complaint does not conform to Article 56(6) of the Charter indicating\nthat the communication should be lodged within a reasonable time after exhaustion of local remedies, but\nwhere Complainant realises that local remedies shall be unduly prolonged, he/she must submit the\ncomplaint to the Commission immediately. According to the State, although the Charter does not specify\nwhat constitute a reasonable time, the Commission should get inspiration from the other jurisdictions,\nincluding the Inter-American Commission which has fixed six months as reasonable time, adding that even\nthe draft protocol merging the African Court of Justice and the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights\nprovides for six months.\n60. The State argued that the communication was submitted 22 months after the alleged violation, which\naccording to the State \"was filed well out of time\". On Complainant's submission that he had been seeking\npsycho therapy treatment, the State argued that [the] Complainant had been the centre of attraction in\nSouth Africa since 2004, demonising the Respondent State, adding that articles published by [the]\nComplainant in the South African press do not show someone with a psychological ailment. The State\nadded that no proof had been given of the alleged treatment or an expert diagnosis of how such condition\nwas acquired. On [the] Complainant's claim that he had no resources, the State argued that he had his\npension benefits which he could have used to submit his complaint to the Commission.\n61. The State concluded its submissions by noting that \"no cogent reasons have been given for the failure\nto pursue local remedies or remedies before the Commission within a reasonable time\", and as such the\ncommunication should be declared inadmissible.\n\n7\n\n\fCompetence of the African Commission\n\n62. In the present communication, the Respondent State raises a question regarding the competence of the\nAfrican Commission to deal with this communication. The State avers that: \"... basically the facts and\nissues in dispute do not fall within the rationae materae and rationae personae of the jurisdiction of the\nCommission\". This statement thus challenges the competence of the African Commission to deal with this\ncommunication. The Commission will thus, first deal with the preliminary issue of its competence raised by\nthe Respondent State.\n63. Black's Law Dictionary defines rationae materae as \"by reason of the matter involved; in consequence\nof, or from the nature of, the subject-matter\". While rationae personae is defined as \"By reason of the\nperson concerned; from the character of the person\".4\n64. Given the nature of the allegations contained in the communication, such as allegations of violation of\npersonal integrity or security, intimidation and torture, the Commission is of the view that the\ncommunication raises material elements which may constitute human rights violation, and as such, it has\ncompetence rationae materae to deal with the matter, because the communication alleges violations to\nhuman rights protected in the Charter. With regards to the Commission's competence rationae personae,\nthe communication indicates the name of the author, an individual, whose rights under the African Charter,\nthe Respondent State is committed to respecting and protecting. With regards to the State, the Commission\nnotes that Zimbabwe, the Respondent State in this case, has been a State Party to the African Charter\nsince 1986. Therefore, both the Complainant and the State have locus standi before the Commission, and\nthe Commission thus has competence rationae personae to examine the communication.\n65. Having decided that it has competence rationae materae and rationae personae, the African\nCommission will now proceed to pronounce on the admissibility requirements and the contentious areas\nbetween the parties.\nDecision of the African Commission on admissibility\n\n66. The admissibility of communications before the African Commission is determined by the requirements\nof Article 56 of the African Charter. This article provides seven requirements which must all be met before\nthe Commission can consider and declare a communication admissible. It one of the\nconditions/requirements is not met the Commission shall declare the Communication inadmissible, unless\nthe Complainant provides justifications why any of the requirements could not be met.\n67. ln the present communication, the Complainant avers that his complaint meets the requirements under\nArticles 56 (1) to (4), (6) and (7). He admits that he did not attempt to comply with the requirement provided\nunder Article 56.5 dealing with the exhaustion of local remedies, but added that given the nature of his\ncase, and the circumstances under which he left the Respondent State, and is living in South Africa, the\nexception rule under this sub-section of Articles 56, should be invoked.\n68. The State on the other hand argues that the Complainant thus not complied with the provisions of\nArticles 56(2), (5) and (6) of the Charter, and urges the Commission to declare the communication\ninadmissible, based on non-compliance with these requirements.\n69. The African Commission will thus examine each of the provisions under Article56 of the African Charter,\nwhether it is disputed of not, as the African Commission has a responsibility to ensure that every\nrequirement in Article 56 has been fulfilled before admitting a communication.\n70. The requirements under Article 56 of the Charter are meant to ensure that a communication is properly\nbrought before the Commission, and seek to sieve frivolous and vexatious communications before they\nreach the merits stage. Thus declaring a communication admissible does not mean the Slate Party\nconcerned has violated the provisions of the Charter. It simply means that the communication meets the\nrequirements necessary for it to be considered on the merits. As indicated earlier, for a communication to\nbe declared admissible, it must meet all the requirements under Article 56. Therefore, it a party contends\nthat another party has not complied with one of the requirements, the Commission must pronounce itself on\nthe contentious issues between the parties, as well as the non-contentious issues.\n71. Article 56(1) of the African Charter provides that communications will be admitted if they indicate their\nauthors, even if they request anonymity. In the present case the author of this communication is identified\nas Michael Majuru, he has also not requested that his identity be hidden. The respondent State has also\nbeen cleared identified as the Republic of Zimbabwe. Therefore the provision of Article 56(1) has been\nadequately complied with.\n\n8\n\n\f72. Article 56(2) of the African Charter provides that a communication must be compatible with the Charter\nof the OAU (now Constitutive Act of the African Union) or with the African Charter on Human and Peoples'\nRights In the present communication, the Respondent State argues that the communication does not\ncomply with this requirement. The State asserts in this regard that, for a complaint to be compatible with the\nCharter or the Constitutive Act, it must prove a prima facie violation of the Charter.\n73. Compatibility denotes 'in compliance' or 'in conformity with' or 'not contrary to' or 'against'.5 In the\npresent communication, the Complainant alleges among others, violations of his right to personal integrity\nand being subjected to intimidation, harassment and psychological torture lie alleges further that agents of\nthe intelligence service of the Respondent State constantly harassed him and prevented him from\nexercising his duties freely. These allegations do raise a prima facie violation of human rights. In particular,\nthe right to the security of the person or personal integrity and the fight to work under satisfactory condition\nas stipulated in the Charter. In the jurisprudence of this Commission, Complainants need not specify which\narticles of the Charter have been violated, or even which right is being invoked, so long as they have raised\nthe substance of the issue in question. That, in the view of the Commission, has been established in this\ncase. Based on the above, the African Commission is satisfied that the requirement of Article 56(2) of the\nAfrican Charter has been sufficiently compiled with.\n74. Article 56(3) of the Charter provides that a communication will be admitted if they are not written in\ndisparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned and its institutions or to the\nOrganisation of African Unity (now the African Union). In the present case, the communication sent by the\nComplainant, does not, in the view of the, African Commission, contain any disparaging or insulting\nlanguage, and as a result of this, the requirement of Article 56(3) has been fulfilled.\n75. Article 56(4) of the Charter provides that the communication must not be based exclusively on news\ndisseminated through the mass media. This communication was submitted by the Complainant himself and\ngives an account of his personal experience with the law enforcement agents of the Respondent State. As\na result of this, the requirement of Article 56(4) has also been met.\n76. Article 56(5) of the Charter provides that a communication will be admitted only after all local remedies\nhave been exhausted. The Respondent State contends that the Complainant has not brought his case\nbefore the courts of the State in compliance with this provision of the Charter. The State argues that there\nare sufficient and effective local remedies available to the Complainant in the State, and the Complainant\nhas not sought these remedies before bringing the present communication before the Commission. On the\nother hand, the Complainant argues that since he had to flee the country due to fear for his life, he could\nnot come back to the country to pursue these local remedies.\n77. The rationale for the exhaustion of local remedies is to ensure that before proceedings are brought\nbefore an international body, the State concerned must have the opportunity to remedy the matter through\nits own local judicial system. This prevents the international tribunal from acting as a court of first instance,\nrather than as a body of last resort.6\n78. Three major criteria could be deduced from the practice and Jurisprudence of the Commission in\ndetermining compliance with this requirement namely: the remedy must be available, effective and\nsufficient.\n79. ln 147.95-149.96, the Commission stated that \"a remedy is considered available if the petitioner can\npursue it without impediment: it is deemed effective if it offers a prospect of success, and it is found\nsufficient if it is capable or redressing the complaint\". In 147.95-149.96, which both parties have cited, the\nCommission held that \"the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in\npractice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. ... Therefore, if the applicant\ncannot turn the judiciary of his country because of fear for his life (or even those of his relatives), local\nremedies would be considered to be unavailable to him\".\n80. The Complainant in the present communication on claims that he left his country out of fear for his life\ndue to intimidation, harassment and undue influence in the exercise of his duties. The Complainant has\nalso alleged a history of non-compliance with the orders of the court of the Respondent, and alleges that a\nhuman rights NGO in Zimbabwe - the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, has documented 12 cases\nsince the year 2000, where the State has ignored court rulings that go against it. According to the\nComplainant, it is noteworthy that although local remedies may be available in the Respondent State, there\nis no assurance of its effectiveness or its implementation due to the fact that if the court rules in favour of\nthe Complainant, there is no guarantee that the ruling will be complied with by the State.\n81. The Complainant cited the African Commission's decisions in the Jawara case and the cases of\nAlhassan Abubakar v Ghana7 and Rights International v Nigeria8 in which he said the Commission found\n9\n\n\fthat the Complainants in these cases could not be expected to pursue domestic remedies in their country\ndue to the fact that they had fled their country and were in fact residing outside their country at the time the\ncommunications were brought before the Commission.\n82. Having studied the Complainant's submissions, and comparing it with the above cases cited in support\nof his claim, this Commission is of the opinion that the above cases cited by the Complainant are not similar\nto his case. In the Jawara case for example, the Complainant was a former Head of State who had been\noverthrown in a military coup. Mr Jawara alleged that after the coup, there was, \"blatant abuse of power\nby.... the military junta\". The military government was alleged to have initiated a reign of terror, intimidation\nand arbitrary detention. He further alleged the abolition of the Bill of Rights as contained in the 1970\nGambia Constitution by Military Decree No. 30/31, ousting the competence of the courts to examine or\nquestion the validity of any such Decree. The communication alleged the banning of political parties and of\nMinisters of the former civilian government from taking part in any political activity. The communication\nfurther alleged restrictions on freedom of expression, movement and religion. These restrictions were\nmanifested, according to the Complainant, by the arrest and detention of people without charge,\nkidnappings, torture and the burning of a mosque.\n83. In the 147.95-149.96 case, the Commission concluded that \"the Complainant in this case had been\noverthrown by the military, he was tried in absentia former Ministers and Members of Parliament of his\ngovernment have been detained and there was terror and fear for lives in the country. There is no doubt\nthat there, was a generalised fear perpetrated by the regime as alleged by the Complainant. This created\nan atmosphere not only in the mind of the author but also in the minds of right thinking people that returning\nto his country at that material moment, for whatever reason would be risky to his life. Under such\ncircumstances, domestic remedies cannot be said to have been available to the Complainant\". The\nCommission finally noted that, \"it would be an affront to common sense and logic to require the\nComplainant to return to his country to exhaust local remedies\".\n84. In the 103.93 case, it should be recalled that Mr Alhassan Abubakar was a Ghanaian citizen who was\narrested by the Ghanaian authorities in the 1980s for allegedly cooperating with political dissidents. He was\ndetained without charge or trial for over 7 years until his escape from a prison hospital on 19th February\n1992 to Côte d'lvoire. After his escape, his sister and wife who had been visiting him in Côte d'lvoire, were\narrested and held for two weeks in an attempt to get information on the Complainant's whereabouts. The\nComplainant's brother informed him that the police have been given false information about his return, and\nhave on several occasions surrounded his house, searched it, and subsequently searched for him in his\nmother's village.\n85. In the early part of 1993, the UNHCR in Côte d'lvoire informed the Complainant that they had received\na report on him from Ghana assuring that he was free to return without risk of being prosecuted for fleeing\nfrom prison. The report further stated that all those detained for political reasons had been released. [The]\nComplainant on the other hand maintained that there is a law in Ghana which subjects escapees to\npenalties from 6 months to 2 years imprisonment, regardless of whether the detention from which they\nescaped was lawful or not. On the basis of the above, the Commission held that \"considering the nature of\nthe complaint it would not be logical to ask the Complainant to go back to Ghana in order to seek a remedy\nfrom national legal authorities. Accordingly, the Commission does not consider that local remedies are\navailable for the Complainant\".\n86. In Rights International9 , the victim, a certain Mr Charles Baridorn Wiwa, a Nigerian student in Chicago\nwas arrested and tortured at a Nigerian Military Detention Camp in Gokana. It was alleged that Mr Wiwa\nwas arrested on 3rd January 1996 by unknown armed soldiers in the presence of his mother and other\nmembers of his family and remained in the said Military detention camp from 3rd to 9th January 1996. While\nin detention, Mr Wiwa was horsewhipped and placed in a cell with forty-five other detainees. When he was\nidentified as a relative of Mr Ken Saro −Wiwa he was subjected to various forms at torture. Enclosed in the\ncommunication was medical evidence of Mr Wiwa's physical torture. After 5 days in the detention camp in\nGokana, Mr Wiwa was transferred to the State Intelligence Bureau (SIB) in Port Harcourt. Mr Wiwa was\nheld from 9-11 January 1996, without access to a legal counsel or relatives, except for a five minutes\ndiscussion with his grandfather. On 11th January 1996, Mr Wiwa and 21 other Ogonis were brought before\nthe Magistrate Court 2 in Port-Harcourt, charged with unlawful assembly in violation of Section 70 of the\nCriminal Code Laws of Eastern Nigeria 1963. Mr Wiwa was granted bail, but while out on bail some\nun-known people believed to be government agents abducted him and threatened his life by forcing him\ninto a car in Port-Harcourt. On the advice of human rights lawyers, Mr Wiwa fled Nigeria on 18th March\n1996 to Cotonou Republic of Benin, where the UN High Commissioner for Refugees declared him a\n10\n\n\frefugee. On September 17th 1996, the US government granted him refugee status and he has been\nresiding in the United States since then.\n87. In this case, the African Commission declared the communication admissible on grounds that there was\nlack of available and effective domestic remedies for human rights violations in Nigeria under the military\nregime. It went further to assert that \"the standard for constructive exhaustion of domestic remedies is\nsatisfied where there is no adequate or effective remedy available to the individual. In this particular case,\nMr Wiwa was unable to pursue any domestic remedy following his flight for fear of his life to the Republic of\nBenin and the subsequent granting of refugee status to him by the United States of America\".\n88. The present communication brought by Mr Michael Majuru should also be differentiated from Gabriel\nShumba v Republic of Zimbabwe10 . In the Shumba case, the Complainant alleged that, he, in the\npresence of 3 others, namely Bishop Shumba, Taurai Magayi and Charles Mutama was taking instructions\nfrom one of his clients, a Mr John Sikhala, in a matter involving alleged political harassment by members of\nthe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP). Mr John Sikhala is a Member of Parliament from the Movement for\nDemocratic Change (MDC), which is an opposition party in Zimbabwe. At about 11:00 pm riot police\naccompanied by plain-clothes policemen and personnel identified to be from the Central Intelligence\nOrganisation (CIO) stormed the room and arrested everyone present. During the arrest, the Complainant's\nlaw practising certificate, diary, files, documents and cell phone were confiscated and he was slapped and\nkicked several times by, among others, the Officer in Charge of Saint Mary's Police Station.\n89. The Complainant and the others were taken to Saint Mary's Police Station where he was detained\nwithout charge and denied access to legal representation. He was also denied food and water. The\nComplainant claimed that on the next day following his arrest he was removed from the cell, a hood was\nplaced over his head and he was driven to an unknown location where he was led down what seemed like\na tunnel to a room underground. The hood was removed, he was stripped naked and his hands and feet\nwere bound in a foetal position and a plank was thrust between his legs and arms. While in this position,\nthe Complainant was questioned and threatened with death by about 15 interrogators. The Complainant\nfurther alleged that he was also electrocuted intermittently for 8 hours and a chemical substance was\napplied to his body. He lost control of his bodily functions, vomited blood and he was forced to drink his\nvomit. The Complainant submitted a certified copy of the medical report describing the injuries found on his\nbody. Following his interrogation, at around 7pm of the same day, the Complainant was unbound and\nforced to write several statements implicating him and several senior MDC members in subversive\nactivities. At around 7:30pm he was taken to Harare Police Station and booked into a cell. On the third day\nof his arrest, his lawyers who had obtained a High Court injunction ordering his release to court were\nallowed to access him. The Complainant was subsequently charged under section 5 of the Public Order\nand Security Act that relates to organising, planning or conspiring to overthrow the government through\nunconstitutional means. He then fled Zimbabwe for fear of his life.\n90. In the above cases, there is one thing in common - the clear establishments of the element of fear\nperpetrated by identified state institutions fear which in the 147.95-149.96 case, the Commission observed\nthat \"it would be reversing the clock of justice to request me complainant to attempt local remedies\".\n91. In the communication under consideration however, Mr Michael Majuru alleges that he fled the country\nfor fear of his life, that he was intimidated and harassed by the Minister of Justice and by suspected state\nagents. He also indicated that he received \"a telephone call from a sympathetic member of the legal\nfraternity and the police that the Respondent State was fabricating a case against him and that he was to\nbe arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for defying the Respondent's orders\".\n92. In this communication, it is clear that the Complainant has simply made general accusations and has\nnot corroborated his allegations with documentary evidence, sworn affidavits or testimonies of others. He\nclaims the Minister sent an Instruction through a colleague of his but there is no way of ascertaining this\nfact. The applicant was the President of the Administrative Court, and has not show how the instruction\npurportedly sent by the Minister through the Complainant's colleague, who the Commission is not told the\nkind of influence he had over the Complainant, could have or did intimidate him. Apart from the direct\ntelephone call the Complainant claims he received from the Minister on 23rd October and 24th November\n2003, all the alleged threats intimidations and harassment he claims, were perpetrated by persons he\nsuspects were government agents. Most of his allegations are unsubstantiated. For example, he indicated\nin paragraph 2.5.4.7 of his submissions that \"the Minister expressed his displeasure with the said decision\nand further attempted to unduly influence and/or threaten the Complainant\". He fails to show how this\nattempted influence or threat by the Minister was carried out.\n\n11\n\n\f93. It is further observed by the Commission that the alleged threat or pressure claimed by the Complainant\nto have been meted by Enoch Kamushinda, who the complainant himself refers to as a suspected Central\nIntelligence Organisation (CIO) operative, has not been substantiated: neither has the purported pressure\nand entrapment alleged to have been made by Mr Ben Chisvo who according to the Complainant, is a\nsuspected CIO informer. Furthermore, the Complainant alleged he received a telephone call from a\nsympathetic member of the legal fraternity and the police that the Respondent State was fabricating a case\nagainst him, and that he was to be arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for\ndefying the Respondent's orders. All the above allegations are not substantiated take the latter for example,\nwhat if the \"sympathetic member of the legal fraternity\" was a hoax? What if he was acting on his own or\nwanted to benefit from the misfortune of the Complainant? His or her name is not even known.\n94. It is not possible for the Commission to determine the level of intimidation or harassment that is needed\nto instil fear in a person to force that person to flee for their life. However, in the instant case, there is no\nconcrete evidence to link the Complainant's fear to the Respondent State.\n95. It is therefore the opinion of the Commission that the Complainant has not sufficiently demonstrated\nthat his life or those of his close relatives were threatened by the Respondent State, forcing him to flee the\ncountry, and as such, cannot hold that the Complainant left the country due to threats and intimidation from\nthe State.\n96. However, the question is, having left the country, could the Complainant still have exhausted local\nremedies or better still is he required to exhaust local remedies?\n97. The first test that a local remedy must pass is that it must be available to be exhausted. The word\n\"available\" means \"readily obtainable\", [/quote]\"accessible\"[/quote]11 ; or \"attainable, reachable on call, on\nhand ready, present; ... convenient, at one's service, at one's command, at one's disposal, at one's beck\nand call\"12 . According to the African Commission, a remedy is considered to be available if the petitioner\ncan pursue it without impediments or if he can make use of it in the circumstances of his case.13 In the\npresent communication, the question to be asked is whether there were remedies available to the\nComplainant even from outside the Respondent State?\n98. The State indicates that in terms of its laws, a Complainant need not be physically present in the\ncountry in order to access local remedies, adding that both the High Court Act and the Supreme Court Act\npermit any person to make an application to either court through his/her lawyer. In support of this, the State\ncited the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka case where the victims were tortured by state agents and they\napplied for compensation while they were both in the United Kingdom and succeeded in their claim. The\nState concluded that the Complainant is not barred from pursuing remedies in a similar manner. The State\nfurther argues that since his resignation, the government of Zimbabwe continues to pay the Complainant\nhis pension benefits which he could have used to instruct his counsel in Zimbabwe to attend to his claim on\nhis behalf.\n99. The Complainant does not dispute the availability of local remedies in the Respondent State, but\nargues that in his particular case, having fled the country for fear of his life, and now out of the country,\nlocal remedies are not available to him.\n100. The African Commission holds the view that having failed to establish that he left the country\ninvoluntarily, and the view of the fact that in Zimbabwe law, one need not be physically in the country to\naccess local remedies; the Complainant cannot claim that local remedies were not available to him.\n101. The Complainant argues that even if local remedies were available, they were not effective because\nthe State has the tendency of ignoring court rulings taken against it, citing among others, the High Court\ndecision in the Commercial Farmers Union and the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka cases, and added\nthat the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights has documented at least 12 instances where the state has\nignored court rulings since 2000.\n102. The Rules of Procedure of the African Commission provide that \"the Commission shall determine\nquestions of admissibility pursuant to Article 56 of the Charter\"14 . Generally the rules require applicants to\nset out in their submissions the steps taken to exhaust domestic remedies. They must provide some prima\nfacie evidence of an attempt to exhaust local remedies. The Human Rights Committee has stated that the\nmere fact that a domestic remedy is inconvenient or unattractive, or does not produce a result favourable to\nthe petitioner does not, in itself, demonstrate the lack of exhaustion of all effective remedies.15 In the\nCommittee's decision on A v Australia16 , it held that [quote]\"mere doubts about the effectiveness of local\nremedies or prospect of financial costs involved did not absolve the author from pursuing such remedies\"17\n. In Article 19 v Eritrea, the Commission held that \"it is incumbent on the Complainant to take all necessary\nsteps to exhaust, or at least attempt the exhaustion of local remedies. It is not enough for the Complainant\n12\n\n\fto cast aspersion on the ability of the domestic remedies of the State due to isolated incidences\". The\nEuropean Court of Human Rights on its part has held that even if the applicants have reason to believe that\navailable domestic remedies and possible appeals will be ineffective, they should seek those remedies\nsince \"it is generally incumbent on an aggrieved individual to allow the domestic courts the opportunity to\ndevelop existing rights by way of interpretation\".18\n103. From the above analysis, this Commission is of the view that the Complainant ignored to utilise the\ndomestic remedies available to him in the Respondent State, which had he attempted, might have yielded\nsome satisfactory resolution of the complaint.\n104. Article 56(6) of the Charter provides that \"Communications received by the Commission will be\nconsidered if they are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted, or\nfrom the date the Commission is seized with the matter ...\" The Respondent State contends that the\npresent communication on was not submitted on time by the Complainant, as required by the African\nCharter.\n105. The present communication was received at the Secretariat of the Commission on 8th November 2005\n(even though dated 2nd November 2005). It was considered for seizure by the Commission in November\n2005, that is, two years after the Complainant allegedly fled from the country. The Complainant never\napproached the courts of the Respondent State. He left the country in December 2003 and only seized the\nCommission twenty two months later. The Complainant submits without substantiating that he had been\nundergoing psychotherapy while in South Africa, and also indicated that he did not have the financial\nmeans to bring the case before the Commission. He also stated that he had hoped the situation in the\ncountry would improve to enable him utilise domestic remedies but there was instead a deterioration.\n106. The Commission notes that the Complainant is not residing in the Respondent State and notes further\nthat the Complainant indicated that he was prevented from submitting his complaint on time, because the\njudiciary abides by a code of conduct in terms of which they do not ordinarily speak out and take positions\nagainst the establishment, noting that out of eight or so members who have left Zimbabwe because of\npersecution, he is the only one who was speaking out. He added that he was afraid for the lives of\nmembers of his immediate family that were at risk of persecution because of him.\n107. The State on its part argues that \"no cogent reasons have been given for the failure to pursue local\nremedies or remedies before the Commission within reasonable time\". The State submits that the\ncommunication was submitted 22 months after the alleged violation, which according to the State \"was filed\nwell out of time\". On Complainant's submission that he had been seeking psycho-therapy treatment, the\nState argued that Complainant had been the centre of attraction in South Africa since 2004 demonising the\nRespondent State adding that articles published by the Complainant do not show someone with a\npsychological aliment. The State added that no proof had been given of the alleged treatment or an expert\ndiagnosis of having such condition was acquired. On Complainant's claim that he had no resources, the\nState argued that he had his pension benefits which he could have used to submit his complaint to the\nCommission.\n108. The Charter does not provide for what constitutes \"reasonable period\". However, the Commission has\nthe mandate to interpret the provisions of the Charter19 and in doing so; it takes cognizance of its duty to\nprotect human and peoples' rights as stipulated in the Charter. The provisions of other international\nregional instruments like the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the\nInter-American Convention on Human Rights, are almost similar and state that they > 20 , after this period\nhas elapsed the Court/Commission will no longer entertain the communication.\n109. The Commission is urged in Articles 60 and 61 of the Charter to consider as subsidiary measures to\ndetermine the applicable principles of law \"other general or special international instruments, laying down\nrules expressly recognised by member states of the African Union.\" Going by the practice of similar\nregional human rights instruments, such as the inter-American Commission and Court and the European\nCourt, six months seem to be the usual standard. This not withstanding, each case must be treated on its\nown merit. Where there is good and compelling reason why a Complainant could not submit his/her\ncomplaint for consideration on time, the Commission may examine the complaint to ensure fairness and\njustice.\n110. In the present communication, the arguments advanced by the Complainant as impediments for his\nlate submission of the complaint do not appear convincing. The complainant does not supply the\nCommission with medical proof to indicate he was suffering from mental problems, he does not indicate\nwhat gave him the impression that things might improve in Zimbabwe, alter he himself noted in his\ncomplaint that since 2000 there has been documented evidence to show that things were deteriorating,\n13\n\n\fincluding the fact that the government does not respect court judgments. Even if the Commission accepts\nthat he fled the country and needed time to settle, or that he was concerned for the safely of his relatives,\ntwenty two (22) months after fleeing the country is clearly beyond a reasonable man's understanding of\nreasonable period of time. The African Commission thus holds that the submission of the communication\nwas unduly delayed and thus does not comply with the requirements under Article 56(6) of the Charter.\n111. Article 56(7) of the African Charter provides that the communication must not deal with cases which\nhave been settled by the States, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations, or the Charter of\nthe OAU or the African Charter. In the present case, this case has not been settled by any of these\ninternational bodies, and as a result of this, the requirement of Article 56(7) has been fulfilled by the\nComplainant.\n\nHolding\n\nThe African Commission finds that in the present communication, that is, Communication 308/05 - Michael\nMajuru/Zimbabwe, the Complainant has not complied with sub-sections (5) and (6) of Article 56 of the\nAfrican Charter, and thus declares the communication inadmissible.\nAdopted at the 44th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights,\n10th - 24th November 2008, Abuja, Nigeria.\n\nFootnotes\n1 Communication 71/92.\n2 Communication 147/95 and 149/96.\n3 Communication 215/98.\n4 H C Black, JN Nolan-Haley & J R Nolan, Black's Law Dictionary (6 Ed.) 1990, 1262-1263.

On 27 July 2012 the Secretariat of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the\nChild (henceforth, the Committee ) received a communication, pursuant to Article 44(1) of the African\nCharter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (herein after, the Charter ), submitted by the Centre for\nHuman Rights, University of Pretoria (South Africa) and La Rencontre Africaine pour la Défense des Droits\nde lHomme (RADDHO) of Senegal (all of which shall be referred later as the Complainants ).\n2. The Complainants are alleging that children as many as 100,000 (known as talibés ), aged between 4\nand 12 years, are sent away by their parents to live in Quranic schools known as daaras in the urban\ncentres of the Republic of Senegal (henceforth, referred to as the Respondent State ) allegedly to receive\nreligious education. The Complainants allege that the situation depicts the difficulties that such children are\nfacing in attaining government schooling.\n3. The Complainants, moreover, allege that the talibés are forced by their instructors 1 known as marabouts\n) to work on the streets as beggars. According to the Complainants, such forced child begging has been an\non-going practice in the Respondent State since the 1980s, despite the existence of provisions in the Penal\nCode 2 outlawing the practice of forcing a child to beg. 3 These penal provisions have been reinforced by\nthe Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Related Practices 4 and to Protect Victims adopted by the\nRespondent State in 2005, which prescribes 5-10 years imprisonment and a fine of five to twenty million\nCFA francs for a person found guilty of forcing a child to beg.\n4. According to the Complaints, despite the existence of these legislations, the Respondent State has made\nlittle efforts to enforce these provisions with a view to penalizing the marabouts who force talibés to beg,\nconsequent to which as of 2011 only 10 cases were brought to court resulting in nine convictions of\nmarabouts. The Complaints submit that the highest actual duration of imprisonment for all convictions\nunder the foregoing laws was one month imprisonment; which, according to them, represents a decrease in\nthe severity of penalties imposed on the marabouts as compared to past years.\n5. The Complainants also allege that the Respondent State's Constitution (2001) 5 allows only specific\nindividuals under specific mandates to bring cases and only to challenge the constitutionality of certain\nprovisions of any law. And, as such, there is no actio popularis in the Respondent State's legal system.\nCases for vindication of human rights violations may only be brought to court by individuals who have been\ndirectly affected by a violation and any decision will provide remedy only for those litigants, or for those who\nare directly connected to the case or have un interest et qualite pour agir .\n6. According to the Complainants, where a non-state agency wants to represent victims of violations of\nhuman rights, like the talibés in this matter, the consent of parents must first be obtained. The only other\navenue to bring such a claim to court is to petition the Chief Prosecutor, whose decision is made\ndiscretionary and in consultation with the Minister responsible for justice.\n7. In addition, the Complainants allege that the Respondent State has not provided minimum standards to\n1\n\n\fregulate non-state schools and that it does not conduct inspections of the daaras to check if there are\nviolations of the rights of the talibés attending schooling and living therein.\n8. The Complainant allege further that the conditions in many daaras are deplorable; usually housed in\nunsafe and unhygienic structures where children sleep in over-crowded rooms or outside, with little or no\naccess to clean water or sanitation. Talibés living in daaras rarely obtain enough food resulting in chronic\nmalnourishment and frequently contract diseases where the marabouts do not provide the talibés with\nmedical care or assistance. In some instances, according to the Complainants, the talibés are injured by\nspeeding motor vehicles in the course of begging on the streets\n9. The Complainants also allege that the talibés are required to bring a daily quota (in the form of rice,\nsugar or money) that they collected from begging in the streets to the daaras , failure to attain which results\nin beatings and punishments to defaulting talibés . On average, talibés spend between six and eight hours\nbegging, which leaves them with less than five hours to spend on Qur'anic education per day. As result of\ntheir concentration on attaining their daily quotas, many talibés do not learn the Qur'an as it is\ncontemplated.\n10. Furthermore, the Complainants allege that the talibés are normally separated from living with their\nparents and are deprived of any contact with their families. The talibés are also physically assaulted and\nharshly punished when they attempt to leave the daaras .\n\nThe Complaints\nAdmissibility\nComplainants' submission on admissibility\n\n11. The Complainants allege that, as a result of the foregoing situation and due to the failure by the\nRespondent State to protect the talibés , there are continuous violations of numerous rights and freedoms\nof such children, to which they are entitled under the Charter. It is the Complainants' allegation that the\nRespondent State has violated, and continues to violate, the provisions of Article 4 (best interests of the\nchild); Article 5 (the right to survival and development); Article 11 (the right to education); Article 12 (the\nright to leisure, recreation and cultural activities); Article 14 (the right to health and health services); Article\n15 (prohibition of child labour); Article 16 (protection against child abuse and torture); Article 21 (protection\nagainst harmful social and cultural practices); and Article 29 (prohibition of sale, trafficking and abduction of\nchildren) of the Charter.\n12. The Complainants have indicated that they have submitted the present Communication on behalf of the\ntalibes in the Respondent State, whose rights under the Charter have been violated by the Respondent\nState. And, as such, they have the competence to do so under Chapter 2 Article 1(I)(2)\n× The Author of the communication shall specify either to have been a victim of violations of the rights spelt\nout in the Charter, or to act on behalf of a victim or of other eligible parties.\nof the Committee's Communication Guidelines. The Complainants are of the view that they can submit the\nCommunication even if the consent of the victims was not obtained since they are acting in the overall best\ninterest of the child . The Complainants further argue that the consent of the victims is not a requirement\nwhen there is evidence of serious, massive and systematic violations of the rights of talibes as it was\nindicated in Commission's decision in Amnesty International v Sudan6 .\n13. Concerning the form of the Communication, the Complainant submit that the present communication\nsatisfies the requirement as to form as set out in Chapter 2 Article 1(II)(1)\n× No communication shall be considered by the Committee if:\n• it is anonymous;\n2\n\n\f• it is not written;\n• it concerns a State non-signatory to the Charter.\nof the Communication Guidelines, which requires that a communication should not be anonymous; should\nbe written; and should concern a State signatory to the Charter.\n14. In relation to the content of the Communication, the Complainants submit that the communication has\nsatisfied the requirements as to content as per Chapter 2 Article 1 (III) (1) (a) (b) &(c) of the Communication\nGuidelines since the communication concerns violations of the provisions of the African Children's Charter;\nit is not solely based on information circulated by the media; it has not been considered according to\nanother investigation, procedure or international regulation.\n15. The Complainants submit that exhaustion of local remedy in this matter is unnecessary considering the\nbest interests of the number of children whose rights are being violated relying on a decision of the African\nCommission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR/the Commission) in African Institute for Human\nRights and Development (sic!) v Guinea . 7 . In the cited Decision, the Commission held that a local remedy\ncould not be exhausted given the number of potential victims who were in the region since it would be\nimpractical for them to approach the courts. The Complainants are of the view that international law\nrequires that the exhaustion of domestic remedies should only be in respect of those that are available,\neffective and adequate. And the Complainants argue that there is no effective judicial remedy for the talibes\ninsofar as actio popularis in the Respondent State's courts is not in favour of the talibes as they do not have\nstanding to do so. In addition, the Complainants have invoked the jurisprudence of the Commission which\nreveals that in cases of serious and massive violations , local remedies need not be exhausted. 8 In this\ncase, it is the Complainants' submission that the failure by the Respondent State to protect so many\nchildren on the streets in the State's major cities where they suffer egregious violations of their rights\nenshrined in the Charter for so many years amount to serious and massive violations.\nACERWC's analysis and decision on admissibility\n\n16. The Committee notes that the Complainants are non-governmental organizations recognized by the\nAfrican Union through the Commission; and are doing so on behalf of victim talibes in the Respondent\nState and therefore can be the authors of the Communication.\n17. The Committee also notes that the Complainants have satisfied the conditions and requirement as to\nform as laid down in Chapter 2 Article 1(I)\n× No communication shall be considered by the Committee if:\n• it is anonymous;\n• it is not written;\n• it concerns a State non-signatory to the Charter.\nof the Committee's Communication Guidelines, i.e. the communication explicitly states the name of the\nauthors, is well written and concerns a State Party to the Charter.\n18. In the matter of content of the Communication, the Committee agrees that the communication is\ncompatible with the Constitutive Act of the AU and the Charter as it concerns violations of the provisions of\nthe Charter. The Committee notes the Commission's Decision in Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum v\nZimbabwe9 to the effect that to be compatible with the Charter, the communication has only got to invoke\nprovisions of the law which are presumed to have been violated. 10 The Committee in this matter also\nagrees with the Complainant that the Communication is not solely based on information circulated by\nmedia; rather it is based on information provided, inter alia, by the alleged victims primarily through\npersonal interviews of the talibes made by the complaining NGOs and information obtained from reports\nmade by credible organisations. In addition, the Committee has undertaken investigation and confirmed\n3\n\n\fthat the issue at hand has not been considered in another international procedure.\n19. In considering whether or not the Complainants have exhausted local remedies available in the\nRespondent State, the Committee would like to reiterate its position that is stated in Children of Nubian\nDescents Case . 11 In that communication, the Committee held that Article 46 of the Charter mandates it to\ndraw inspiration from International Law on Human Rights. Basing this explicit legislative mandate, the\nCommittee made reference to laws, and jurisprudence from other countries or treaty bodies in Africa and\nelsewhere. 12\n20. The Committee would also like to draw inspiration from the ACHPR in considering the requirement to\nexhaust local remedy. In Sir Dawda Jawara v The Gambia13 , the Commission held that a remedy is\nconsidered available if the complainant can pursue it without impediment 14 ; it is deemed effective if it\noffers a prospect of success; and it is found sufficient if it is capable of redressing the complaint. 15\nTherefore, it is a well-established jurisprudence of the Commission that only domestic remedies that are\navailable, effective, and adequate (sufficient) that need to be exhausted . 16 As such, the Commission has\nrecognized that the exhaustion of prior domestic remedies implies and assumes the availability,\neffectiveness and sufficiency of domestic adjudication procedures. If local remedies are unduly prolonged,\nunavailable, ineffective or insufficient, the exhaustion rule will not bar consideration of the case by the\nCommission. 17\n21. From this analysis of the jurisprudence of the Commission, the following exceptions to the rule of prior\nexhaustion of local remedy are remarkable. First, domestic remedies must be of judicial nature ; second,\ndomestic remedies must not be unduly prolonged ; third, where there are ouster clauses domestic\nremedies are rendered unavailable; and, fourth, local remedies cannot be exhausted where there are a\nlarge number of potential victims of violations of human rights.\n22. The Complainants have amply demonstrated that the Respondent State's penal laws (Penal Code) 18\nand Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Related Practices and to Protect Victims adopted by the\nRespondent State in 2005 19 proscribe forcing a child to beg. 20 However, the Respondent State has made\nlittle efforts to enforce these provisions with a view to penalizing the marabouts who force talibes to beg. It\nis in record that, as of 2011 only 10 cases were brought to court resulting in nine convictions on marabouts\n. The Complaints have submitted that the highest actual duration of imprisonment for all conventions under\nthe foregoing laws was one month imprisonment and the Committee is of the view that this avenue\ninefficient.\n23. The Committee also finds the avenue to petition the Chief Prosecutor to bring a claim to court on behalf\nof the talibes victims of violations of their rights by marabouts in the daaras to be ineffective because the\nChief Prosecutor's decision is made discretionary and in consultation with the Minister responsible for\njustice, which does not amount to a remedy that is judicial in nature. Another avenue that the Complainants\nalso have indicated to be in place in the Respondent State is the requirement that only the victim talibes or\nsomeone directly affected by the alleged violations can bring cases in domestic courts. In practice, this\nwould entail each of the estimated 100,000 talibes would bring their own claim in courts. The Committee\nconcurs with Complainants' submission that this avenue is so impractical as to be virtually impossible .\nTherefore, the Committee is of the view that the Complainants should avail from the exceptions of the\nrequirement of exhaustion of local remedies as there is no effective and sufficient remedy for the talibes .\n24. In view of the forgoing reasons, during its 21 st Ordinary Session, which was held 15 to 19 April 2013,\nthe Committee found the Communication to have fulfilled all the admissibility conditions as laid down in the\nCommittee's Guidelines on the Consideration of Communications and as such, the Committee declared the\nComplaint admissible.\nProcedure\n\n25. After the decision on admissibility, the Committee transmitted the complaint to the Respondent State,\n4\n\n\fwhich duly filed its written reply, after which the matter was scheduled for a public hearing. During its 23 rd\nOrdinary Session, from 9 - 16 April 2014 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, a public hearing was held where\nrepresentatives of the Complainants and the Respondent State made their oral submissions.\nThe Respondent State's Arguments\n\n26. Both in its written reply to the Complaints and oral submissions, the Respondent State has not\nspecifically rejected the allegations. It has actually admitted that the alleged violations of the various\nCharter provisions exist, and continue to take place.\n27. In recognition of the existence of the alleged violations, the Respondent State submitted that it has\nadopted various constitutional, policy, legislative and administrative measures aimed at, inter alia ,\nprotecting all children, particularly those forced to beg. In particular, the Respondent State contended that\nas a result of a workshop that was held early 2013 to formulate strategic plans of action for the eradication\nof child begging, an inter-ministerial council on the managing of child begging was convened on Friday, 8\nFebruary 2013, under the auspices of the Honourable Prime Minister. Consequent to this event, an ad-hoc\nCommittee was set up and it has adopted a number of recommendations which revolve around three\nstrategic options:\n\n1. The withdrawal of all child beggars from the street and their temporary placement in public\ninstitutions, community centres and voluntary families, as well their integration with their family or\ncountry of origin. This would also involve the implementation of measures relative to the educational\naspects and to economic support for the family;\n2. Social Policy Communication for a positive and lasting behavioural change that occurs through\neffective application of the law and with the strong will of political, religious, social, and cultural\nactors aimed at eradicating child begging; and\n3. The prevention aspect; that is, while particularly emphasising policy and law enforcement, there is a\nneed for utilising existing initiatives by the communities to assist children in their villages of origin\nand the strengthening of public and community social services.\n\n28. In respect of eliminating worst forms of child labour, the Respondent State submitted that it has\nundertaken various measures; including establishing the Project for the Fight against the Worst Forms of\nChild Labour within the Ministry of Labour. Regarding the improvement of the quality of education in the\ndaaras , the Respondent State contended that it has set up the Trilingual Project of the Direction of\nAlphabetisation and of National Languages within the Ministry of National Education (i.e. Le Projet\nTrilinguisme de la Direction de l'Alphabétisation et des Langues Nationales ). This project strives to\nintervene in the daaras in order to offer the opportunity to the talibés of learning and mastering three (3)\nlanguages (i.e. French, Arabic and a national language translated in Arabic characters), in addition to\nvocational skills training.\n29. With reference to the protection of talibés and other children on the street from physical abuses, the\nRespondent State submitted that its Ministry of Interior has a specialised police force, the Minors Brigade ,\nwhose mission is to protect morally threatened children, to identify them and to ensure their reintegration, in\ncollaboration with the other structures. In addition, the Ministry of Health is developing numerous initiatives\nfor the development of the welfare of children, including l'Ecole Nationale des Travailleurs Sociaux\nSpécialisés (ENTSS), which has, since 2005, introduced a training module on the rights of the child. There\nis also the Support Cell to the Protection of the Child, which is located at the Presidency to support different\ninitiatives from state and civil society structures.\n30. The Respondent State also submitted that it has been striving to involve non-state actors, particularly\nlocal and international NGOs (including Community-based organisations) to provide assistance, advocacy\n5\n\n\fand prevention interventions. Moreover, communities and families play a primary role in the protection of\nchildren, in order to develop a common understanding of the existing structures, to create a public\nconsensus and to guide the taking of decisions at the national level.\n31. Furthermore, the Respondent State pointed out that it has ratified various international human rights\ntreaties, particularly the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and ILO Conventions on the\nElimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour and the Minimum Age Convention, namely the Conventions\n138\n× [ http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C138\nand 182\n× http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C182\n. These international treaties have been domesticated in the State Party's legislation in the context of the\n2001 Constitution, particularly through the enactment of the Code of Criminal Procedures, which\nentrenches the best interests of the child. Other pieces of legislations include the Penal Code 21 ; the\n79-1165 Decree of 20 December 1975, which prohibit punishment and physical abuse in schools and\neducation centres which are not conventional; the 2004-38 law of 28 December 2004, which has abolished\ndeath penalty and applies to all children without exception, even to foreign and migrant children; and the\n2005-06 law of 10 May 2005, which criminalizes trafficking in persons, including children, and similar\npractices, as well as prohibiting forced begging.\n32. The Respondent concluded its submission by indicating that the eradication of child begging has\nalways been a source of constant problem for the Senegalese authorities, despite the enactment of several\nprovisions of the law, decrees, policies, and various administrative measures.\nConsideration on Merits\nA. Alleged Violation of Article 4 (best interest of the child)\n\n33. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has violated Article 4 of the African Children's\nCharter, which provides for the best interest of the child, as the State has failed to protect talibés from\nviolations in the daaras . They also allege that the Respondent State is duty bound to assert the best\ninterest of children by regulating the conduct of non-state actors and ensuring that they do not violate\nchildren's rights.\n34. The Committee notes that Article 4 of the African Children Charter requires the best interest of the child,\none of the four general principles, to be the primary consideration in all actions to be taken by any person\nor authority. The principle of the best interest of the child aims at safeguarding the realization of children's\nrights effectively and contributing to their holistic development. 22\n35. In guaranteeing the best interest of the child, a State Party has the obligation to ensure the\nconsideration of the best interest of the child in all actions taken by any person or authority affecting the life\nof the child. In this context, any person is broadly interpreted and entails that entails that the principle of the\nbest interest of the child must be applied in all actions concerning children, regardless whether those\nactions are undertaken by private or public entities. The Committee also notes that action includes\nomissions and commissions that are manifested in decisions, proposals, services, procedures and other\nmeasures. 23\n36. Applying the principle of the best interest of the child to the vase at hand, the Committee notes that\napart from the interest of parents to send their children to receive religious education, Talibés children in\nthe Respondent State go to the daaras mainly because of the difficulties of attaining government schooling\nin their precincts. In the daaras , the children are forced to beg by their teachers ( marabouts ), where on\naverage, they spend six to eight hours begging with five hours or less left to spend on Qur'anic studies per\nday.\n6\n\n\f37. The Respondent State, being a State Party to the Charter, accepts the explicit prohibition of child\nbegging under Article 29(b) and it has complied with this obligation through its prohibition of child begging\nas provided for under Article 245 to 247(b) of its Penal Code. However, the Respondent State has failed to\ndischarge its obligation to enforce these provisions by not taking the necessary administrative measures,\nincluding supervision of the daaras and bringing to justice the marabouts who force talibés into begging.\nThe State Party has the obligation to protect the rights enshrined in the Charter, which requires measures\nby the State to ensure that third parties (individuals, institutions, etc.) do not deprive of children's rights. In\nthis regard the Committee refers to the jurisprudence as established by the African commission on Humans\nand Peoples' Rights. In Mouvement Burkinabe des Droits de l'Homme et des Peuples v Burkina Faso , the\nAfrican Commission on Human and Peoples Rights (henceforth, the Commission ) has set the\njurisprudence to the effect that a State Party is responsible for violation of human rights committed by\nnon-state actors as its obligation to ensure the respect for human rights demands it to take all the\nnecessary measures to ensure that non-state actors also respect the rights of children. 24 The Commission\nhas also stipulated that failure to prevent violation against children's rights by non-state actors makes the\nState internationally responsible. 25 An obligation of this type is called an obligation to protect the human\nrights standard, or, in short, the obligation to protect . Building on the Commission's jurisprudence, the\nCommittee states that the individual responsibility of non-State actors to respect the rights of children does\nnot relieve the concerned State of its obligations under human rights law to respect, protect and fulfill\nhuman rights.\n38. In the case at hand, despite the obligation set under the principle of the best Interests of the child, the\nCommittee notes that the Government of Senegal has failed to enforce current national, regional, and\ninternational laws and agreements already in place by taking measures, including prosecuting, against\nperpetrators and abusive religious leaders; and hence the Respondent State has failed its responsibility to\nprotect.\n39. Therefore, the Respondent State is responsible under Article 4 of the Charter for not taking necessary\nadministrative and other measures against the daaras , marabouts as well as parents who send their\nchildren to the daaras .\nB. Alleged violation of Article 5 (survival and development)\n\n40. The Complainants in this communication allege that the Respondent State has violated the right to\nsurvival and development of the talibés as enshrined in the Charter by not taking any action against the\nforced begging. The Complainants further state that the forced begging of the talibés causes the disregard\nof their rights to health care, education, clean and safe environment, and clean water, which in effect are\nfundamental components of the right to survival and development. Furthermore, the fixed quota imposed\non talibés for begging subjects them to an extensive, institutionalized child labour.\n41. Considering the allegation made by the Complainants, the Committee carefully analysed the situation of\nthe children in light of the elements of the right to survival and development. Article 5(1) of the African\nChildren's Charter provides that every child has an inherent right to life and this right must be protected by\nlaw. Article 5(2) complements the recognition of this right by obliging states to ensure to the maximum\nextent possible the survival, protection and development of the child. The Committee notes the\ncomplementary nature of the right to survival and development as essential preconditions to the enjoyment\nof the rights protected in the African Children's Charter. In other words, the Committee supports the\nconceptualization of the right to life survival and development as a general principle that serves to reinforce\nthe raison d'?tre of each of the rights enshrined in the Charter. 26\n42. Survival and development encapsulates the right to life and imposes an obligation on states to ensure\nan adequate standard of living for children including the right to life and their physical, mental, spiritual,\nmoral, psychological and social development. The obligations of the State Party under this principle also\nencompass protection of children's rights to access healthcare and education services, access to clean\n7\n\n\fwater, the right to live in safe and clean environment, and protection from any form of abuse and degrading\ntreatment, including child labour.\n43. In the case at hand, the Committee notes that most talibés are suffering from extreme hunger on a daily\nbasis, often eating at best one or two small meals a day, usually consisting of bread and rice. Reports and\nstudies reveal that the majority of begging children in Dakar, including talibés , were observed to be\nmalnourished, often severely. The Committee also note that deprived of food by their guardians, many\ntalibés are forced to beg in markets or door-to-door in neighborhoods to try to fulfill their daily nutritional\nneeds. As a result of the long hours talibés spend on the street, the malnutrition they suffer from\ninadequate food, and the deplorable conditions in many daaras, resulted in suffering of the children from\nfrequent illnesses.\n44. The Committee also notes that there is a reported case where nine Talibés in the dense Medina\nneighborhood died after a daara burned down on 03 March 2013. Cases of talibés being crushed in traffic\nwhile begging are also frequently reported.\n45. Despite the gravity of the problem, the Respondent State has not taken adequate measures to curb the\nsituation. The Committee strongly believe that in the face of this tragedy, the Senegalese Government must\nfinally tackle the country's widespread abuse and exploitation of young boys through forced begging. Tens\nof thousands of boys continue to live and beg in extremely precarious conditions, enriching teachers who\nhave twisted the country's tradition of religious education. The Committee, therefore, found the situation\nunacceptable and it contradicts the principles enshrined in the African Children's Charter and other\ninternational child rights instruments. Hence, the Government of Senegal has failed to ensure to the\nmaximum extent possible, the survival, protection, and development of the talibés children, As such, the\nRespondent State is in violation of Article 5 of the African Children's Charter.\nC. Alleged violation of Article 11 (education)\n\n46. Article 11 of the Charter posits that States Parties have the obligation to provide free and compulsory\nbasic education without any discrimination. 27 In realizing the right to education, the State must ensure,\ninter alia , the availability, accessibility and acceptability of the education provided to children. Availability is\nassessed in terms of quality; accessibility is determined in terms of equal opportunity, economic and\nphysical accessibility and acceptability is inferred from the quality of education provided. 28 A State Party is\nnot only obliged to provide education but also to ensure that the education so provided is of acceptable\nquality. In the context of Article 11(2)(a) of the Charter, education should be directed towards the\ndevelopment of child's personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential. The\nCommittee has noted the importance of education in relation to the responsibility of the child in its decision\nof the Children of Nubian Descents Case . 29 Children have responsibility to their family, society and\ncountry under Article 31 of the Charter; and, as such, they can discharge these obligations only when they\nget the necessary education. Furthermore, education is a tool to enhance the protection of children from\ndangerous and hazardous labour. 30 As the Commission has accentuated that the failure to provide access\nto institutions of learning would amount to a violation of the right to education under the African Charter on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights. 31\n47. The responsibility of a State in realizing the right to education includes the obligation to protect, fulfill,\nrespect and promote. The protection mandate entails a responsibility up on the State to protect children's\nright to education from being violated by third parties. To this end the State Party should set minimum\nstandards for all educational institutions 32 including the daaras . Article 11(5) of the Charter moreover\nstates that: States Parties to the present Charter shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that a child\nwho is subjected to schools or parental discipline shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the\ninherent dignity of the child and in conformity with the present Charter.\n48. The Respondent State, however, has failed to provide free and compulsory education to all children in\naccordance with the Charter. Consequently, the talibés are forced to attend in the daaras where they are\n8\n\n\fnot subjected to school fees except for the daily quota they should bring by begging. Nevertheless, the\nchildren do not get the necessary education they are entitled to in the daaras. The talibés do not get\neducation in daaras as they spend more time in begging to fulfill their daily quota. In addition, the\ngovernment failed to provide the necessary curriculum and facilities in which the daaras function in\ndelivering education.\n49. The Committee refers to the General Comment of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on the\naims of education, which states that education should be designed to empower the child by developing his\nor her skills, learning and other capacities, human dignity, self-esteem and self-confidence. 33 Moreover,\nthe Committee also refers to Article 9(b) of the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam which states\nthat every human being has a right to receive both religious and worldly education . Therefore, the\nCommittee holds a view that while many marabouts in Senegal continue the traditional practice of teaching\ntheir students the Quran, others have twisted the practice into a form of economic exploitation, as a result a\nsignificant number of talibés in Senegal are failing to receive either a religious education or an education in\nother basic skills. It is in consideration of this fact that the International Labour Organization (ILO)'s\nCommittee of Experts criticized Senegal on March 2, 2012, for its failure to protect talibés from abusive\nconditions and demanded that Senegal do more to prosecute those responsible for forced begging and to\ncarry out \" daara modernization \" - ensuring that the schools meet basic international standards of\neducation and child protection.\n50. The government must enforce its own laws to protect talibés from this abuse and ensure that the\neducation received in daaras equips these children with a rounded education, and does not allow forced\nbegging. The Senegalese government enacted legislation in 2005 that criminalized forcing others into\nbegging for personal financial gain. But the authorities have largely failed to take concrete steps to enforce\nthe law and end the exploitation and abuse of the talibés . Therefore, the Government of Senegal has\nviolated the right to education of the talibés by failing to ensure the availability, accessibility and\nacceptability of the education and supervising the daaras .\nD. Alleged violation of Article 14 (health and health services)\n\n51. The Charter under Article 14 provides that State Parties should take measures to ensure the provision\nof necessary medical assistance and health care to all children with emphasis on the development of\nprimary health care; and to ensure the provision of adequate nutrition and safe drinking water . In Purohit\n&Moore V The Gambia the Commission stated that:\nEnjoyment of human right to health as it is widely known is vital to all aspects of a person's life and\nwellbeing and is crucial to the realization of all the other fundamental human rights and freedoms. This right\nincludes the right to health facilities, access to goods and services to be guaranteed to all without\ndiscrimination of any kind. 34\n52. The efforts undertaken by the State Party in realizing this right should be directed towards the\nprevention of diseases and health problems, and the provision of the necessary health care services. In\nensuring adequate nutrition and safe drinking water to all children, the CRC committee emphasized that\nschool feeding programmes, and the provision of safe and clean drinking water are essential to combat\ndisease and malnutrition. 35 Failure to provide safe drinking water amounts to a violation of the right to the\nbest attainable health under the Charter. 36\n53. Looking at the case under consideration, the poor conditions in the daara , combined with a lack of\nclothes and shoes for the long days on the street, increase the vulnerability of the talibés to different forms\nof health challenges. Forced to beg for food, many are also extremely malnourished. The Committee notes\nthat when the talibés get sick their marabout rarely provides medicines, in some instances requiring them to\nbeg even greater hours in order to pay for their own treatment. More often, despite their ill health the talibés\ncontinue begging to satisfy the quota.\n\n9\n\n\f54. The Respondent State has the obligation to assure that children are not deprived of access to health\ncare services. It should further take all the necessary steps to avert any kind of institutional, cultural and\nfinancial obstacle to accessing health care services. 37 The State should not tolerate any practice which\nviolates the right to health of children. 38 It must assert that third parties do not deprive children of their right\nto access medical service.\n55. As submitted by the complainants, the talibés are not practically entitled to adequate sanitation and\nnutrition which in effect endangers their health. The Committee notes that the marabouts as caregivers\nhave failed to ensure that the talibés get medical service.\n56. Hence the Committee concluded that the Respondent State has failed to provide the necessary\nsanitation and nutrition to the talibés and it has also failed to take measures against the marabouts , who\naccommodate talibés in squalid health conditions. The Respondent State has not taken appropriate steps\nwithin its available resource to prevent disease and malnutrition, as well as to avoid barriers to access the\nhealth services of those children in need of medical care. Therefore, the Committee finds the Respondent\nState in violation of Article 14 of the Charter.\nE. Alleged violation of Article 15 (child labour)\n\n57. The Complainants allege that the urban talibés are an identifiable group of children vulnerable to be\nexploited for the worst forms of child labour. Accordingly they submit that the number of hours the children\nspent per day begging, the beatings for not bringing a sufficient quota of goods per day and the health and\nsafety risks caused by standing in busy streets is contrary to international laws which categorize child\nbegging as a practice of exploitive labour. 39\n58. Art 15 of the African Children's Charter obliges State Parties to take legislative and administrative\nmeasures for the formal and informal employment sector to protect children from all types of economic\nexploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with their physical,\nmental, spiritual, moral or social development. Further the International Labour Organization's (ILO)\nConvention 182 under Art 1\n× Each Member which ratifies this Convention shall take immediate and effective measures to secure the\nprohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour as a matter of urgency.\nand 9\n× The formal ratifications of this Convention shall be communicated to the Director-General of the\nInternational Labour Office for registration.\nrequires States to ensure the effective abolition of child labour and implementation of the Convention.\n59. In the case at hand, contrary what is prescribed under the regional and international instruments, the\nCommittee notes that many marabous force the talibés to beg on the streets for long hours-a practice that\nmeets the ILO definition of a worst form of child labor. The Committee is of the view that the forced\nbegging, physical abuse, and dangerous daily living conditions endured by these talibés violate domestic\nand international law. Despite being party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter\non the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and all major international and regional treaties on child labor and\ntrafficking, which provide clear prohibitions against the worst forms of child labor, physical violence, and\ntrafficking, Senegal has scantily enforced the laws.\n60. The Committee notes that in the last decade, the government has notably defined forced begging as a\nworst form of child labor and criminalized forcing another into begging for economic gain, but this adequate\nlegislation has so far led to little concrete action. No marabout was held accountable for forced begging,\ngross neglect, and severe physical abuse against the talibés .\n61. In view of this, the Committee believes that forced begging places children in a harmful situation on the\nstreet and therefore meets the ILO's definition of a worst form of child labor. Moreover, the Committee\n10\n\n\fnotes that the forced begging and gross neglect is done with a view toward exploitation, with the marabout\nreceiving the child from his/her parents and profiting from the child's labor, which resulted in continuous\nsuffering oftens of thousands of talibés in Senegal. Though the Respondent State has ratified international\nlaws and prohibits the act of child begging under its national law, it has failed to take any effective\nadministrative measures against the marabouts and to protect the talibés from exploitation. Therefore, the\nGovernment of Senegal has violated Article 15(2) of the African Children's Charter which requires the State\nParty to take appropriate administrative measures to ensure the full protection of children from child labor\nhaving regard to the relevant provisions of the ILO's instruments.\nF. Alleged violation of Article 16 (protection against child abuse and torture)\n\n62. In this communication the Complainants submit that the fact that the talibés are regularly subjected to\nbeatings and fear in cases where they do not reach the minimum daily begging quota, leads to high levels\nof stress and anxiety which amounts to violation of their right to be protected from abuse and torture under\nArt 16 of the African Children's Charter.\n63. Considering the complaint, the Committee notes that as prescribed under the African Children's\nCharter, protecting children from abuse and torture requires States to adopt legislative, administrative,\nsocial and educational measures through effective establishment of special monitoring units to provide\nnecessary support for the child and for those who have the care of the child, as well as other forms of\nprevention and identification, reporting referral investigation, treatment, and follow-up of instances of child\nabuse and neglect.\n64. Taking into consideration the elements of the provision of the law and the acts as alleged by the\nComplainants, the Committee discusses whether the beatings committed by marabouts amounts to child\nabuse and torture. In this regard the Committee refers to the jurisprudences of the ACHPR. In Curtis\nFrancis Doebbler v Sudan the African Commission found the act of lashing as it constitutes a cruel\ntreatment. 40 Moreover, in International Pen and Others v Nigeria , the ACHPR defines inhumane and\ndegrading treatment to include not only actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering, but\nwhich humiliate the individual or force him or her to act against his will or conscience . 41\n65. In the case at hand, the Committee notes that the beating of the talibés qualifies as a physical\npunishment since physical force is used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort for not\nbringing the required quota. There are also reported cases where talibés typically described being taken to\na room, stripped of their shirt, and beaten with an electric cable or a club. 42 In some instances the beatings\nand physical abuse may rise to the level of torture under the Convention against Torture. According to the\nConvention torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is\nintentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a\nconfession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having\ncommitted, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of\nany kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or\nacquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity 43 .\n66. With regard to the accountability of State actors for acts committed by non-state actors, the Committee\nrefers to the explanation given by the Committee on the Convention against Torture. The Committee on the\nConvention against Torture states that where state authorities or others acting in official capacity or under\ncolour of law, know or have reasonable grounds to believe that acts of torture or ill-treatment are being\ncommitted by non-State officials or private actors and they fail to exercise due diligence to prevent,\ninvestigate, prosecute and punish such non-State officials or private actors consistently with the\nConvention, the State bears responsibility and its officials should be considered as authors, complicit or\notherwise responsible under the Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in such impermissible act . 44\n67. Legislative, administrative, social and educational measures are the means through which States can\nfulfill their obligation to protect children from any form of violence. 45 Although there are legislative and\n11\n\n\fsocial initiatives in Senegal to protect the rights of children in general, the government failed to take specific\nadministrative and judicial measures against the marabouts . The Respondent State did not deny the fact\nthat since 2010 only 10 cases have been brought against marabouts who exploits children resulting in only\nnine convictions. Apart from the social term orientation for children in the street and destitute families and\n24 Department Committees for the Protection of the Child (CDPE), 46 the Committee notes that there are\nno educational and sufficient social measures that aim at changing the situation of the talibés .\n68. As the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has stated that the prohibition against physical and\nmental violence also applies to corporal punishment in schools. 47 The physical abuse likewise places the\nmarabout in conflict with Senegal's penal code, which provides particular care to children. 48 The severe\nphysical abuse that many marabouts inflict on the talibés , as well as the looming threat of violence,\ntherefore violates the children's right to freedom from physical and mental violence and abuse and torture.\nThe Government of Senegal therefore is in clear violation of Article 16 of the African Children's Charter\nwhich requires the State Party to protect children from physical, mental, injury, abuse, neglect,\nmaltreatment and torture.\nG. Alleged violation of Article 21 (protection against harmful social and cultural practices)\n\n69. According to Article 21(1)(a) of the African Children's Charter, States Parties are under obligation to\ntake measures towards the elimination of harmful social and cultural practices which endanger the health or\nlife of the child. Furthermore, Article 1(3) of the Charter provides that:\nAny custom, tradition, culture or religious practice that is inconsistent with the rights, duties and obligations\ncontained in the present Charter shall to the extent of such inconsistency be discouraged.\n70. A harmful practice, according to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the\nConvention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), should meet the\nfollowing criteria;\n\n1. They constitute a denial of the dignity and/or integrity of the individual and a violation of human\nrights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the two Conventions;\n2. They constitute discrimination against women or children and are harmful insofar as they result in\nnegative consequences for them as individuals or groups, including physical, psychological,\neconomic and social harm and/or violence and limitations on their capacity to participate fully in\nsociety or develop and reach their full potential;\n3. They are traditional, re-emerging or emerging practices that are prescribed and/or kept in place by\nsocial norms that perpetuate male dominance and inequality of women and children, based on sex,\ngender, age and other intersecting factors;\n4. They are imposed on women and children by family, community members, or society at large,\nregardless of whether the victim provides, or is able to provide, full, free and informed consent.\n49\n\n71. Therefore, States Parties must take legislative, administrative and other appropriate measures to\nabolish any practice inconsistent with the Charter. Using children in any form of begging is one form of\nharmful practice which is clearly prohibited under Article 29 of the African Children's Charter; and the State\nmust take all the necessary steps to restrict such practice.\n72. Even though the Respondent State has outlawed the practice of forced begging under Article 3 of Law\nNo. 2005-06, the talibés are still being forced to beg and bring back to the daaras a daily quota the failure\nof which incurs punishment. The State has not taken any measures against these schools. The talibés are\nrequired to bring a daily quota, in order to fulfill their quota they have to beg on the street where they will be\nexposed to exploitation. The forced begging has compromised their right to life and development as they\n12\n\n\fare often injured from traffic accidents. Moreover, this cultural practice by the marabouts causes the\nviolation of other provisions of the Charter. The talibés are not enjoying their legal right to play, leisure and\ncultural activities which can advance their mental and psychological developments. This activity of begging\nis deep rooted in the Qur'anic schools and the Committee is of the view that it is a harmful practice.\n73. The government of Senegal has failed to take measures against the marabouts , to monitor the\nsituation of children in the Qur'anic schools, and to ensure that the talibés are getting the necessary\neducation to which they are entitled. Even though the marabouts are non-state actors, the State of Senegal\nis responsible for the violation caused by such actors due to its obligation to protect the rights of children.\nThe Committee thus finds a violation of Article 21(1) of the African Children's Charter by the Respondent\nState.\nH. Alleged violation of Article 29 (sale, trafficking and abduction, and using children in the form of begging)\n\n74. Citing Article 29 of the African Children's Charter, the complainants argued that the State Party has\nviolated the Charter which expressly forbids forced begging and States Parties to take appropriate\nmeasures to prevent the abduction, the sale of, or traffic of children for any purpose or in any form, by any\nperson including parents or legal guardians of the child; and the use of children in all forms of begging. The\ncomplainants also made reference to the ILO Conventions which make it clear that states are responsible\nfor the prevention of child labour through effective enforcement. Further, they expressly state that work akin\nto slavery (which includes trafficking of children and compulsory labour) and work that harms the health,\nsafety or morals of children comprises the worst forms of child labour. 50\n75. Considering the alleged fact, the Committee finds it important to expound on what amounts to child\nsale, trafficking and abduction. The Committee notes that children are one of the most vulnerable groups\ntargeted for the trafficking in human beings. Children are trafficked as they can be easily recruited and\nquickly replaced. The exploitation of children violates the human rights of children to have a safe childhood\nin their family setting, to receive education, to have time to play and to be protected from exploitation. Child\ntrafficking involves the recruitment of victims, their transportation, transfer and harbouring of children for the\npurpose of exploitation. Coercion, violence or threats are not necessary elements in cases of child\ntrafficking as children cannot consent. 51 Children are trafficked for the same purposes as adults: for sexual\nexploitation, for labour exploitation but also for exploitation in a range of criminal activities, including\nbegging.\n76. The use of children in all forms of begging is strictly forbidden under Article 29(b) of the Africa\nChildren's Charter. Article 29(a) in addition prohibits trafficking of children for any purpose in any form. In\nthis regard, the Committee refers to the definition provided by the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC). Under Article 3 the Protocol defines trafficking\nas;\n[T]he recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use\nof force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a\nposition of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a\nperson having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a\nminimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or\nservices, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs\n77. The Ouagadougou Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, Especially Women and\nChildren as adopted by the African Union Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development, Tripoli,\n22-23 November 2006, also conceptualizes trafficking in persons as it happens within and between states,\nurges States to take measures to eliminate harmful customs and traditional practices, including forced child\nbegging, which can lead to trafficking in human beings, including children.\n\n13\n\n\f78. Looking at the case at hand, the Committee realized that the talibés are forcibly subjected to economic\nexploitation through forced labour; and they are used for begging by the marabouts . Given the ILO's views\non forced begging, the Committee concludes that marabouts , when transporting talibés with the primary\nintention of obtaining labour from them, are engaging in child trafficking. Article 3(c) of the Trafficking in\nPersons Protocol includes in the definition of trafficking in persons the recruitment, transportation, transfer,\nharbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation.\n79. Moreover, the Committee learns from reports that only about half the talibés in Senegal are\nSenegalese. The rest are trafficked from neighboring countries, including Guinea Bissau and Mali, where\npoor families are promised their sons will be remunerated as they will receive a proper Islamic education\nunder the care of a marabout at the daaras . The boys often have no contact with their families once they\nleave home, and because most do not know anyone in Senegal, they become entirely reliant on marabout\nfor food, health care and shelter.\n80. These acts, according to the Committee violate the children's rights to be protected from sale, trafficking\nand abduction. The Respondent State has not contested this allegation of the Complainants. The\nCommittee has observed that the Respondent State has taken legislative measures against begging and\ntrafficking. However, the Committee is of the view that legislative measures alone cannot sufficiently protect\nthe rights of children; and the State Party should also take administrative and other appropriate measures\nto ensure that children are not subjected to begging or trafficking as stipulated under Article 1 of the\nCharter. Reaffirming this position in Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum v Zimbabwe , 52 the ACHPR\nstates that an act by a private individual or (non-state actor) and therefore not directly imputable to a state,\ncan generate responsibility of the State, not because of the act itself, but because of the lack of due\ndiligence on the part of the state to prevent the violation or for not taking the necessary steps to provide the\nvictims with reparation. 53\n81. The Committee, therefore, has found the Respondent State in violation of Article 29 of the African\nChildren's' Charter which with no exception prohibits forced begging and requires States Parties to take\nappropriate measures to prevent the abduction, the sale of, or trafficking of children.\n\nDecision of the African Committee\n\n82. Because of the foregoing reasons, the Committee finds multiple violations of the African Children's\nCharter as follows: Article 4 (best interest of the child); Article 5 (survival and development); Article 11 (the\nright to education); Article 14 (health and health services); Article 15 (child labour); Article 29 (sale,\ntrafficking and abduction); Article 16 (protection against child abuse and torture); and {[21,Article 21}}\n(protection against harmful social and cultural practices). Therefore, the Committee recommends that the\nRespondent State should, in accordance with its obligations under the African Children's Charter,\nundertake the necessary measures:\n\n1. To ensure that all talibés are immediately taken back from the streets to their families;\n2. Through cooperation with the neighboring countries (from where some of the children are coming),\ninternational and national organisations, facilitate the reunion of the talibés with their families; [[/li]]\n3. To establish functioning and effective institutions and mechanisms to provide the talibés with shortand long-term, appropriate psychological, medical and social assistance in order to promote their\nfull recovery;\n4. To establish minimum norms and standards for all daaras relating to health, safety, hygiene,\neducation content and quality, and accommodation;\n5. To integrate the daaras into the formal education system;\n6. To inspect the daaras regularly to ensure that standards set out in the Charter and local legislation\nare complied with and close all the daaras which are not in compliance with the required standards;\n7. With a view of fighting impunity and preventing forced begging, sale, abduction and trafficking of\nchildren, ensure that all the perpetrators are brought to justice and held accountable for their actions\n14\n\n\fwith penalties commensurate with the severity of their crimes;\n8.

I am in agreement with the views of my colleagues in regard to the conclusions reached by the Court on\nthe question of its jurisdiction and on that of the costs and expenses of the case, and consequently I have\nvoted in favour of the said conclusions. However, I believe that these two issues deserved to be developed\nin a more comprehensive manner.\n2. The Applicant indeed has the right to know why it has taken nearly one year between the date of receipt\nof his application at the Registry and the date on which the Court took its decision thereon. Senegal, on the\nother hand, has the right to know why the Court chose to make a solemn ruling on the application by\nmeans of a Judgment, rather than reject it de plano with a simple letter issued by the Registry. The two\nParties also have the right to know the reasons for which their prayers in respect of the costs and\nexpenses, respectively, of the case, have been rejected; the Applicant should also know why his prayer in\nthis regard was addressed on the basis of Rule 30 of the Interim Rules of the Court (hereinafter referred to\nas the \"Rules\") on Legal Costs, whereas the Court could have equally, if not exclusively, treated this prayer\non the basis of Rule 31 on Legal Assistance.\n3. However, only the question of the jurisdiction of the Court seems to me to be sufficiently vital, to lead me\nto append to the Judgment, an exposé of my separate opinion in regard to the manner in which this\nquestion should have been treated by the Court.\n4. In the present case, the question of the jurisdiction of the Court is relatively simple. It is that of the\nCourt's \"personal jurisdiction\" or \"jurisdiction ratione personae\" in respect of applications brought by\nindividuals. This is governed by Article 5 (3) of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples'\nRights on the Establishment of an African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (hereinafter referred to as\n\"Protocol\") and Article 31 (6) of the said Protocol which set forth the modalities by which a State shall\naccept the said jurisdiction.\n5. However, paragraph 31 of the Judgment states, not without ambiguity, that for the Court to hear a case\nbrought directly by an individual against a State Party, there must be compliance with, inter alia, Article 5(3)\nand Article 34 (6) of the Protocol.\n6. If the only issue referred to here is that of the jurisdiction of the Court, then the expression \"inter alia\"\nintroduces confusion because it lends itself to the understanding that the said jurisdiction is predicated on\none or several other conditions that have not been spelt out. However, in my view, there are no other\nconditions to the jurisdiction of the Court in the case than that which has been specified in Article 34 (6) of\nthe Protocol, reference to which was made in Article 5 (3).\n7. Nevertheless, if the expression \"inter alia\" also refers to the conditions for admissibility of the application,\nthere would no longer be any logical linkage between paragraph 31 and paragraph 29 of the Judgment in\nwhich the Court indicated that it would start by considering the question of its jurisdiction. It would be\nparticularly difficult to understand the meaning of paragraph 39 in which the Court gives its interpretation of\nthe word \"receive\" as used in Article 34 (6) of the Protocol. In paragraph 39, the Court indeed points out\nthat the word \"receive\" as applied to the application should not be understood in its literal meaning as\nreferring to \"physically receiving\" nor in its technical sense as referring to \"admissibility\"; rather it refers to\nthe \"jurisdiction\" of the Court to \"examine\" the application; that is to say, its jurisdiction to hear the case, as\nit states very clearly in paragraph 37 in fine of the Judgment.\n8. Read in light of paragraph 39 of the Judgment, paragraph 31 should therefore be interpreted as referring\nexclusively to the question of the Court's jurisdiction. Since the meaning of the expression \"inter alia\" is\nunclear, the Court had better do away with it.\n9. Even if the expression is removed therefrom, paragraph 31 of the Judgment, and also paragraph 34\nthereof, pose the question of the Court's jurisdiction in terms that do not faithfully reflect the Court's liberal\napproach to the treatment of the application.\n10. In the foregoing two paragraphs of the Judgment, the question of the Court's jurisdiction is indeed\nposed by the exclusive reference to Article 5(3) and Article 34 (6) of the Protocol. However, Article 5\nessentially deals with the question of \"Access to the Court\" as the title clearly indicates. Thus, the question\nof the personal jurisdiction of the Court in this case cannot but receive the response set forth in paragraph\n37 of the Judgment, i.e., that since Senegal has not made the declaration provided for in Article 34 (6) of\nthe Protocol, the Court has no jurisdiction to hear cases instituted directly against this State by individuals.\n1\n\n\fThis ruling could have been made expeditiously in terms of the preliminary consideration of the Court's\njurisdiction as provided for in Rule 39 of the Rules.\n11. Though of fundamental importance to the question of the personal jurisdiction of the Court, Article 5 (3)\nand Article 34 (6) of the Protocol should be read in their context, i.e. in particular in light of Article 3 of the\nProtocol entitled \"Jurisdiction\" of the Court.\n12. Indeed, although the two are closely related, the issues of the Court's \"jurisdiction\" and of \"access\" to\nthe Court are no less distinct, as paragraph 39 of the Judgment in fact suggests1 ; it is precisely this\ndistinction that explains why the Court did not reject de plano the application given the manifest lack of\njurisdiction, by means of a simple letter issued by the Registry, and why it took time to rule on the\napplication by means of a very solemn Judgment.\n13. The application was received at the Court Registry on 29 December 2008 and it was placed on the\ngeneral list as No. 001/2008. The application was served on Senegal on 5 January 2009; and on the same\nday, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission was informed about the filing of the application and\nthrough him the Executive Council and the other Parties to the Protocol.\n14. Thus, upon submission, the application was subject to a number of procedural acts including its\nregistration on the general list of the Court2 and its service on Senegal.\n15. For their part, applications or communications addressed to the African Commission on Human and\nPeoples' Rights3 , the defunct European Commission of Human Rights4 , the Inter-American Commission\nof Human Rights5 , the United Nations Human Rights Committee6 or the International Court of Justice, for\nexample7 , undergo a process of vetting prior to being registered or served on the States against which\nthey were instituted.\n16. In this case, the application did not go through this initial procedural phase of vetting. It was treated in\nthe same way as the applications brought before the International Court of Justice before 01 July 1978,\ndate of entry into force of its new Rules8 . Prior to that date, all cases brought before the Court, including\nthose instituted against States that had not previously accepted the Court's jurisdiction by making the\noptional declaration accepting the compulsory jurisdiction provided for in Article 36 (2)\n× The states parties to the present Statute may at any time declare that they recognize as compulsory ipso\nfacto and without special agreement, in relation to any other state accepting the same obligation, the\njurisdiction of the Court in all legal disputes concerning: a. the interpretation of a treaty; b. any question of\ninternational law; c. the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an\ninternational obligation; d. the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an\ninternational obligation.\n* of the Statute, were indeed placed on the general list and served on the States against which they were\ninstituted, and on the United Nations Secretary General and, through him, on all the other members of the\nOrganisation.\n17. As indicated in the foregoing paragraph 13, procedural acts similar to the aforesaid were undertaken in\nconnection with Mr. Yogogombaye's application; this was, inter alia, served on Senegal under covering\nletter dated 5 January 2009.\n18. Senegal acknowledged receipt thereof by letter dated 10 February 2009 in which it also transmitted the\nnames of those to represent it before the Court. At that stage, Senegal could have limited itself to indicating\nthat it had not made the declaration provided for in Article 34 (6) of the Protocol and that, consequently, the\nCourt had no jurisdiction to deal with the application on the grounds of the provisions of Article 5 (3) of the\nProtocol. However, by notifying the Court of the names of its representatives, it gave room for the\nsuggestion that it did not exclude appearing before the Court and of participating in its proceedings, with\ndoubts as to the object of its participation: to contest the Court's jurisdiction, contest the admissibility of the\napplication or to defend itself on the merits of the case.\n19. By a second letter dated 17 February 2009, Senegal requested the Court to extend the time limit for\nsubmission of its observations to \"enable it to better prepare a reply to the application\". By so doing,\nSenegal signaled its intention to comply with the provisions of Rule 37 of the Rules according to which \"the\nState Party against which an application has been tiled shall respond thereto within sixty (60) days provided\nthat the Court may, if the need arises, grant an extension of time\". Even in this letter. Senegal did not\nexclude the eventual acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction. Still at this stage, it could have put up the\nargument that it has not made the declaration provided for in Article 34 (6) of the Protocol and, on that\nground, contested the jurisdiction of the Court.\n20. Even though it would not have made the aforementioned declaration, Senegal, by its attitude, left open\nthe possibility, however slim, that it might accept the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with the application.\n2\n\n\f21. The fundamental principle regarding the acceptance of the jurisdiction of an international Court is\nindeed that of consent, a principle which itself is derived from that of the sovereignty of the State. A State's\nconsent is the condition sine qua non for the jurisdiction of any international Court9 , irrespective of the\nmoment or the way the consent is expressed10 .\n22. This principle of jurisdiction by consent is also upheld by the Protocol. Thus, in contentious matters, the\nCourt can exercise jurisdiction only in respect of the States Parties to the Protocol. The scope of the Court's\njurisdiction in such cases and the modalities of access thereto are defined in Articles 3 and 5, respectively,\nof the Protocol.\n23. By becoming Parties to the Protocol, member States of the African Union ipso facto accept the\njurisdiction of the Court to entertain applications from other States Parties, the African Commission or\nAfrican Inter-governmental Organisations. The jurisdiction of the Court in respect of applications from\nindividuals or Non-Governmental Organisations against States Parties is not, for its part, automatic; it\ndepends on the optional expression of consent by the States concerned.\n24. This is provided for in Article 34(6) of the Protocol which states that: \"At the time of ratification of this\nProtocol or any time thereafter, the State shall make a declaration accepting the competence of the Court\nto receive cases under Article 5 (3) of this Protocol. The Court shall not receive any petition under Article 5\n(3) involving a State Party which has not made such a declaration\". As it is drafted, this provision raises two\nquestions:\n25. The first is the meaning to give to the word \"shall\" used in the first sentence which suggests that filing of\nthe declaration by the State Party is an \"obligation\" for the State Party and not simply \"a matter of choice\".\n26. Understood in this way, Article 34 (6) would make it obligatory for State Parties to make such a\ndeclaration after depositing their instruments of ratification (or accession)11 . This prescription does not\nhowever have any real legal effect because it does not set any time limit. It also does not make much\nsense when read in light of its context and particularly of Article 5 (3) and the second sentence of 34 (6)\nwhich states that \"The Court shall not receive any petition under Article 5 (3) involving a State Party which\nhas not made such a declaration\". It can thus be said in conclusion that the filing of the declaration is\noptional: this conclusion is corroborated by an analysis of the \"travaux préparatoires\" of the Protoco1.12\n27. The second question raised in Article 34 (6) is that of whether the filing of the optional declaration by\nStates Parties is the only means of expressing their recognition of the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with\napplications brought against them by individuals.\n28. In this regard, it should first be noted that Article 34 (6) does not require that the filing of the optional\ndeclaration be done \"before\" the filing of the application; it simply provides that the declaration may be\nmade \"at the time of ratification or any time thereafter\". Nothing therefore prevents a State Party from\nmaking the declaration \"after\" an application has been introduced against it. In accordance with Article 34\n(4) of the Protocol, the declaration, just as ratification or accession, enters into force from the time of\nsubmission and takes effect from this date. Senegal was therefore free to make such a declaration after the\napplication was introduced.\n29. If a State can accept the jurisdiction of the Court by filing an optional declaration \"at any time\", nothing\nin the Protocol prevents it from granting its consent, after the introduction of the application, in a manner\nother than through the optional declaration.13\n30. Therefore, the second sentence of Article 34 (6) must not, as the first sentence, be interpreted literally.\nIt must be read in light of the object and purpose of the Protocol and, in particular, in light of Article 3\nentitled \"Jurisdiction\" of the Court. Indeed, Article 3 provides in general manner that: \"the jurisdiction of the\nCourt shall extend to all cases and disputes submitted to it\"; it also provides that \"in the event of dispute as\nto whether the Court has jurisdiction, the Court shall decide\". It therefore lies with the Court to determine in\nall sovereignty the conditions for the validity of its seizure; and do so only in the light of the principle of\nconsent.\n31. Consent by a State Party is the only condition for the Court to exercise jurisdiction with regard to\napplications brought by individuals. This consent may be expressed before the filing of an application\nagainst the State Party, with the submission of the declaration mentioned in Article 34 (6) of the Protocol. It\nmay also be expressed later, either formally through the filing of such a declaration, or informally or\nimplicitly through forum prorogutum.14\n32. Forum prorogatum or \"prorogation of competence\" may be understood as the acceptance of the\njurisdiction of an international Court by a State after the seizure of this Court by another State or an\nindividual, and this either, expressly or tacitly, through decisive acts or an unequivocal behaviour.15 It was\nin particular this possibility that the letters issued by Senegal dated 10 and 17 of February 2009 led the\n3\n\n\fCourt to foresee in this case.\n33. Up to 9 April 2009, the date on which the Registry received the written observations of Senegal, there\nwas the possibility that Senegal might accept the jurisdiction of the Court. It was only on this date that it\nbecame unequivocally clear that Senegal had no intention of accepting the Court's jurisdiction to deal with\nthe application.\n34. It was therefore up to the Court to take into account Senegal's refusal to consent to the jurisdiction of\nthe Court to deal with the application and to draw the consequences thereof by putting an end to the matter\nand removing the case from the general list.\n35. Under the former Rules of the International Court of Justice (before 01 July 1978), when a case was\nbrought against a State which has not previously accepted the jurisdiction of the Court by filing the optional\ndeclaration and such a State did not accept the Court's jurisdiction in regard to the case after having been\ninvited to do so by the Applicant State, such a case was closed by the issuance of a succinct order.16 In the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights where the problem of jurisdiction occurs less frequently than that of\nadmissibility of applications, when there is no serious doubt as to the inadmissibility of an application, the\ncorresponding decision is notified to the applicant through a simple letter.17\n36. In the present case, Senegal having formally raised preliminary objections in its \"statement of\ndefense\"18 dated 9 April 2009, the Court deemed it necessary to comply with the provisions of Rule 52 (7)\nof its Rules which stipulates that \"The Court shall give reasons for its ruling on the preliminary objection\"19 .\n[Ed. Note: The expression \"arr?t motive\" in French appears as \"ruling\" in the English version of Rule 52 (7)\nof the Rules].\n37. However, consideration by the Court of Senegal's preliminary objections, in a judgment, required that it\naddresses the question of it's [sic] jurisdiction in a more comprehensive manner by developing in particular\nthe possibility of a forum prorogatum. This possibility is all the more suggested in paragraph 37 of the\nJudgment where the Court, on the grounds of its ruling that Senegal has not made the optional declaration,\nconcluded that the said State, on that basis, \"has not accepted the jurisdiction of the Court to hear cases\ninstituted directly against the Country by individuals or non governmental organizations\". [Ed. Note: The\nexpression \"sur cette base\" in French does not appear in the English version of paragraph 37 of the\nJudgment.]\n38. Nevertheless, it is this possibility of a forum prorogatum, however slight, that explains why the\napplication of Mr. Yogogombaye was not rejected right after 10 February 2009; and it is the filing of\npreliminary objections by Senegal which explains why the Court did not close the case in a less solemn\nmanner by issuing an order or by simple letter by the Registry.\n39. The submission of preliminary objections by Senegal may, in turn, be explained by scrupulous\ncompliance by this State with the provisions of Rule 37 and 52 (1) of the Rules.\n40. Today, the question is whether \"all\" applications filed with the Registry should be placed on the Court's\ngeneral list, notified to the States against which they are directed, and above all, as provided for under\nArticle 35 (3) of the Rules, notified to the Chairperson of the African Union Commission and, through him,\nto the Executive Council of the Union, as well as to all the other States Parties to the Protocol. As a judicial\norgan, once the Court receives an application, it has the obligation to ensure, at least in a prima facie\nmanner, that it has jurisdiction in the matter20 . Certainly, here lies the object of preliminary consideration by\nthe Court of its jurisdiction as provided for in Rule 39 of its Rules. A selection should then be made between\nindividual applications in respect of which, at a glance, the Court has jurisdiction and those in respect of\nwhich it has not, which is the case when the State party concerned has not made the optional declaration.\nIn this latter hypothesis, the application should be rejected de plano by simple letter by the Registry. It could\neventually be communicated to the State Party concerned, but it is only if such a State accepts the\njurisdiction of the Court that the application could be placed on the Court's general list21 and notified to the\nother States Parties. The idea is to avoid giving untimely or undue publicity to individual applications in\nrespect of which the Court clearly lacks jurisdiction.\n41. In this regard, it is important to point out that the potential authors of individual applications may in the\npresent circumstances experience difficulties knowing the situation of an African State vis-?-vis the optional\ndeclaration. Indeed, only the list of the States Parties to the Protocol is being published on the African\nUnion Commission website and this list does not mention the States that have made the optional\ndeclaration. It would therefore be desirable that the list of the States that have made the said declaration be\nsimilarly published on the website for the purposes of bringing the information to the knowledge of\nindividuals and non governmental organisations.\n\n4\n\n\f42. The Court, for its part, cannot be satisfied with such publication as it does not have official value, and is\nnot a \"real time\" reflection of the status of participation in the Protocol and in the system of the optional\ndeclaration. To date, the list of States Parties to the Protocol and that of the States Parties that have made\nthe optional declaration, while being of primary interest to the Court, are not automatically notified to the\nCourt by the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, depository of the Protocol. The Protocol does\nnot oblige the depository to communicate declarations to the Court Registry, its Article 34 (7) contenting\nitself with providing that declarations should be deposited with the Chairperson of the African Union\nCommission \"who shall transmit copies thereof to the State parties\". The Statute of the International Court\nofJustice22 and the American Convention of [sic] Human Rights23 , for their part, provide that the\ndepositories of the optional declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of\nJustice and the Inter-American Court, respectively, should file copies thereof in the Registries of the said\ncourts. Although the relevant department of the African Union Commission is not legally bound to do so, it\nwould also be desirable that in future the said department inform the Court of any update of the two\nabove-mentioned lists.\nFatsah Ouguergouz\nAboubakar Diakité Registrar\n\nFootnotes\n* Editor's note: Link accessed on 30/03/2012 at 4.00pm\n1 On this point, see for example, Prosper Weil who notes as follows: \"jurisdiction and seizure are not only\ndistinct, conceptually; they are separate in time, normally, jurisdiction preceeds seizure [...].

In the Inter-American Court,\nindividuals having no direct access to the Court, the question of personal jurisdiction indeed arises only in\nregard to State Parties; in the European Court where individuals have direct access to the Court, it has\nautomatic jurisdiction solely on the ground of the participation of the member States of the Council of\nEurope in the European Convention on Human Rights.\n8 Rule 38, paragraph 5, of the current Rules of Procedure of the International Court of Justice states that:\n\"When the Applicant State proposes to found the jurisdiction of the Court upon a consent thereto yet to be\ngiven or manifested by the State against which such application is made, the application shall be\ntransmitted to that State. It shall not however be entered in the General List, nor any action be taken in the\nproceedings, unless and until the State against which such application is made consents to the Court's\njurisdiction for the purposes of the case\" (emphasis added).\n9 \"It is a well established principle in International Law that no State can be compelled to submit its disputes\nwith other States to mediation, arbitration or to any method of peaceful solution without its consent\",\nPermanent Court of International Justice, Statute of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion of 23 July 1923,\nSeries B, p.27.\n10 \"Such consent may be given once and for all in the form of a freely accepted obligation: it may however\nbe given in a specific case beyond any pre-existing obligation\". id\n6\n\n\f11 Paragraph 6 of the English version, unlike the French, provides that the declaration may be freely made\non two different occasions: \"at the time of the ratification of this Protocol or any time thereafter\" (emphasis\nadded); the Arab and Portuguese versions of the said Paragraph 6 are identical to the English version.\n12 See Article 6 (1) (Special jurisdiction) of the Cape Town draft (September 1995), Draft Protocol to the\nAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the establishment of an African Court on Human and\nPeoples' Rights, Government Legal Experts Meeting on the establishment of an African Court on Human\nand Peoples' Rights, 6-12 September 1995, Cape Town, South Africa, Doc.

[Translation by the Registry]\n15 \"Forum prorogatum: Latin expression usually translated by the expression \"prorogated jurisdiction\".\nAcceptance by a State of the jurisdiction of an international judicial body, such as the International Court of\nJustice, after a matter has been referred thereto, either by an express declaration to that effect, or by a\ndecisive act implying tacit acceptance. The decisive acts may consist in effective participation in the\nproceedings, either by pleading on the merits, or by making findings on the merits or any other act implying\nlack of objection against any future decision on the merits. In the opinion of the International Court of\nJustice, such conduct can be tantamount to tacit acceptance of its jurisdiction, which cannot subsequently\nbe revoked, by virtue of the bona fide or estoppel principle, Jean Salmon (Ed.). op. cit., p. 518. On this\ndoctrine, see Mohammed Bedjaoui & Fatsah Ouguergouz, \"Le forum prorogatum devant la Cour\ninternational de Justice: les resources d'une institution ou la face cachée, du consensualisme>> in African\nYearbook of International Law, 1998, Vol. V, pp 91-114.\n16 See for example, \"Treatment in Hungary of Aircraft and Crew of the United States of America\", Order of\n12 July 1954, I.C.J.

Report 1956, p. 10.\n17 Personal jurisdiction of the European Court in matters of individual communications is indeed automatic;\nthe Court must therefore first deal with the issue of admissibility of applications and, in this respect, Article\n53 of its Interim Rules, entitled \"Proceedings before a Committee\", provides in its paragraph 2 that \"in\naccordance with Article 28 of the Convention, the Committee may, unanimously, declare an application to\nbe inadmissible or strike it off the cause list, when such a decision can be made without any further\nexamination. The decision shall be final and shall be brought to the attention of the applicant by letter\".\n(emphasis added)\n7\n\n\f18 Expression used in the testimonium clause on page 17 of Senegal's written observations.\n19 The reference to Article 39 of the Rules in Paragraph 29 of the Judgment is not timely as this provision\nconcerns preliminary examination by the Court of its jurisdiction, i.e. a stage of the proceedings during\nwhich it must ensure that it has at least prima facie jurisdiction to entertain an application. At the stage of\nexamining a preliminary objection for lack of jurisdiction, the Court must make a definitive ruling on its\njurisdiction.\n20 On this issue, see for example Gérard Niyungeko, La preuve devant les jurisdictions internationales,\nEditions Bruylant, Editions de l'Université de Bruxelles, Brussels, 2005 p. 55. Thus, according to the\nInternational Court of Justice: \"In accordance with its Statute and established jurisprudence, the Court\nmust, nonetheless, examine [i]proprio motu the issue of its own jurisdiction in order to entertain the request\nof the Government of Greece\", Aegean Continental Shelf, Judgment, ICJ Report I978, p. 7, paragraph 15.\nWith regard to practice at the Inter-American Court, see Ludovic Hennebel, La Convention américaine des\ndroits de l'homme - Mécanismes de protection et étendue des droits et libertés Bruylant, Brussels, 2007, p.\n238, paragraph 277, or the practice of quasi-judicial organs such as the human Rights Committee for\nexample, see Ludovic Hennebel La jurisprudence du Comité des droits de I'homme des Nations Unies - Le\nPacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques et son mécanisme de protection individuelle,\nBruylant, Brussels, 2007 p. 346.\n21 As has been rightly emphasized by an author, registration of an application on the general list of a\njudicial organ \"is in essence a means of eliminating frivolous correspondence or other irrelevant\ncommunications that cannot he considered as applications\", Carlo Santulli. op.cit., p. 400.\n22 Article 36, paragraph 4\n× Such declarations shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall transmit\ncopies thereof to the parties to the Statute and to the Registrar of the Court.\n.\n23 Article 62 paragraph 2\n× Such declaration may be made unconditionally, on the condition of reciprocity, for a specified period, or\nfor specific cases.

These communications were submitted to the African Commission by International Pen, the\nConstitutional Rights Project, INTERIGHTS [and Civil Liberties Organisation] respectively. They were\njoined because they all concern the detention and trial of Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa, a writer and Ogoni\nactivist, president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People. The communications 139/94 and\n154/96 also complain of similar human rights violations suffered by Mr Saro-Wiwa's co-defendants, also\nOgoni leaders.\n2. The communications 137/94 and 139/94 were submitted in 1994 before any trial began. After the murder\nof four Ogoni leaders on 21st May 1994, following riot during a public meeting organised by Movement for\nthe Survival of the Ogoni Peoples (MOSOP) representing the rights of those who lived in oil producing\nareas of Ogoni land, Saro-Wiwa and many hundreds of others were arrested, Saro-Wiwa himself on 22nd\nMay 1994 and the vice-president of MOSOP, Ledum Mitee, shortly thereafter. Both communications allege\nthat Mr Saro-Wiwa was severely beaten during the first days of his detention and was held for several days\nin leg irons and handcuffs. He was also denied access to his lawyer and the medicine he needed to control\nhis blood pressure, at times prevented from seeing his family, and held in very poor conditions.\n3. In its communication, submitted on 9th September 1994, the Constitutional Rights Project included a list\nof 16 other Ogonis who had been held without charge or bail for what was at that time over three months.\nBoth communications alleged that Mr Saro-Wiwa had been detained because of his political work in relation\nto MOSOP. He had been detained five times for brief periods since the beginning of 1993, and released\neach time without charge, except on one occasion in mid-1993 where he was held for several weeks and\ncharged with unlawful assembly.\n4. The State Military Administrator declared that Mr Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants had incited members\nof MOSOP to murder four rival Ogoni leaders, but no charges were brought until 28th January 1995. In the\nmonths between arrest and the beginning of the trial, the defendants were not allowed to meet with their\nlawyers, and no information on the charges was provided to the defence.\n5. In February 1995 the trial of the defendants began before a tribunal established under the Civil\nDisturbances Act. The three members of this tribunal were appointed directly by General Abacha in\nNovember 1994, although counsel for the Rivers State Administrator argued in August that the cases were\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the Rivers State High Court, since Rivers State is where the offences\noccurred.\n6. In June 1995 the Constitutional Rights Project submitted a supplement to its communication, alleging\nirregularities in the conduct of the trial itself: harassment of defence counsel, a military officer's presence at\nwhat should have been confidential meetings between defendants and their counsel, bribery of witnesses,\nand evidence of bias on the part of the tribunal members themselves. In October 1995 PEN also copied to\nthe Commission a letter it sent to General Abacha protesting the lack of concrete evidence and the unfair\nconduct of the trial.\n7. On 30th and 31st October 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of the co-defendants (Saturday Dobee, Felix\nNuate, Nordu Eawo, Paul Levura, Daniel Gbokoo, Barinem Kiobel, John Kpunien and Baribor Bera) were\nsentenced to death, while six others including Mr Mitee were acquitted. The CRP submitted an emergency\nsupplement to its communication on 2nd November 1995, asking the Commission to adopt provisional\nmeasures to prevent the executions.\n8. The Secretariat of the Commission faxed a Note Verbale invoking interim measures under revised Rule\n111 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria, the Secretary\nGeneral of the OAU, the Special Advisor (Legal) to the Head of State, the Ministry of Justice of Nigeria, and\nthe Nigerian High Commission in The Gambia. The Note Verbale pointed out that as the case of Mr\nSaro-Wiwa and the others was already before the Commission, and the government of Nigeria had invited\nthe Commission to undertake a mission to that country, during which mission the communications would be\n1\n\n\fdiscussed, the executions should be delayed until the Commission had discussed the case with the\nNigerian authorities.\n9. No response to this appeal was received before the executions were carried out.\n10. On 7th November 1995 the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) confirmed the sentences of death and on\n10th November 1995 all the accused persons were executed in secret at the Port Harcourt Prison. By\nsection 7 of the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunals) Decree No. 2 of 1987, under which the executed\npersons were tried, the PRC are required to receive the records of the trial Tribunal before confirmation of\nthe decision is possible. These records were not prepared by the Tribunal and so were not available for the\nPRC.\n11. In 1996 the Secretariat received a communication from INTERIGHTS representing Ken Saro-Wiwa Jr.\nIt alleged that the condemned persons had been detained arbitrarily prior to and during the trial and that\nthey had been subjected to torture in the Army camp. Furthermore it alleged serious irregularities\nconcerning the conduct of the trial: that the tribunals that convicted the accused persons were not\nindependent; that there was no presumption of innocence; that the accused persons had not been given\ntime or facilities in which to prepare their defence; that they had been denied legal representation by a\ncounsel of their choice; that there was no right of appeal and that following the sentencing the persons\nwere held incommunicado. INTERIGHTS asserted that they were tried, convicted and sentenced to death\nfor the peaceful expression of their views and opinions on the violations of the rights of the Ogoni people.\n12. In December 1996 the Secretariat received a communication from the Civil Liberties Organisation,\nalleging that the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunal) Decree is invalid because it was made without\nparticipation of the people; that its composition with military officers and members of the Provisional Ruling\nCouncil meant that it could not be impartial; and that the lack of judicial review of the decisions of this\ntribunal amount to a violation of the right to appeal and fair trial. The communication alleges that the trial,\nconviction and sentencing of Ken Saro-Wiwa and others violated Articles 7(1) (b), 7(1) (c) and 7(1)(d) of\nthe African Charter, and that the execution of these persons violates Article 4. The communication alleges\nthat the arraignment of 19 more alleged suspects constitutes another potential violation of the Charter.\n\nComplaint\n13. The communications allege violation of Articles 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16 and 26 of the African Charter.\nThe State response and observations\n\n14. The government argues that its actions were necessary to protect the rights of the citizens who had\nbeen murdered; that the tribunal which tried Saro-Wiwa was competent because two of its three members\nwere lawyers; that the process of confirmation by a state government was an adequate appeal; that the\nCivil Disturbances Decree had not been protested upon its enactment in 1987 and that it had been set up\nto deal with a crisis situation.\n\nProcedure before the Commission\n15. Communication 137/94 is dated 28th September 1994 and was submitted by International Pen.\n16. Communication 139/94 is submitted by Constitutional Rights Project and dated 9th September 1994.\n17. The Commission was seized of the communications at its 16th Session in October 1994, but deferred its\ndecision on admissibility pending notification and receipt of additional information from the Nigerian\nGovernment.\n18. At the 16th session the Commission decided to merge the communications.\n19. On 9th November 1994, a notification of the two communications was sent to the Nigerian Government\nand Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure was invoked, requesting the Nigerian Government not to cause\nirreparable prejudice to Mr. Saro-Wiwa.\n20. On 6th February 1995 a letter was received from International Pen stating that Mr Saro-Wiwa was being\nill-treated and that he was facing the death penalty.\n21. On 13th February a letter was sent to the Nigerian Government re-emphasising the need for Rule 109 to\nbe applied.\n22. On 22nd February 1995, a letter was received from Complainants stating that Ken Saro-Wiwa had been\ncharged and was scheduled to appear before a three person tribunal from which there was no right of\n2\n\n\fappeal. The tribunal members are chosen by General Abacha in violation of international fair trial\nstandards. The complainant recognised that local remedies had yet to be exhausted and announced its\nintention to present an update of the case to the Commission once the trial was completed.\n23. At the 17th Session the Commission declared the communications admissible. They were to be heard\non their merits at the 18th Session.\n24. On 20th April 1995, letters were sent to the Government of Nigeria and the complainants informing them\nof this.\n25. On 28th June 1995 a letter was received from the Constitutional Rights Project describing developments\nin the case.\n26. On 1st September 1995, a letter was sent to the government of Nigeria stating that the communication\nwould be heard on the merits at the 18th Session of the Commission and inviting the government to send a\nrepresentative.\n27. At the 18th Session the Commission decided that the communications should be taken up by the\nmission planned for Nigeria.\n28. On 9th October 1995 a letter was received from PEN American Centre expressing concern for the state\nof health of Mr Saro-Wiwa.\n29. On 1st November 1995, upon hearing that a death sentence had been passed on Mr Saro-Wiwa and\neight of his co-defendants, the Secretariat faxed a Note Verbale to the government of Nigeria, invoking the\nrevised Rule 111 of Procedure (formerly 109) asking that the executions should be delayed until the\nCommission had taken its mission and spoken with the competent authorities. This Note Verbale was also\nfaxed to the Secretary General of the OAU, the Nigerian High Commission in Banjul, and the Special\nAdviser (Legal) to the Head of State of Nigeria.\n30. On 2nd November 1995 a letter was received from the Constitutional Rights Project notifying the\nSecretariat of the death sentences and requesting that provisional measures be invoked.\n31. On 9th November 1995 Commissioner Dankwa, hearing that the death sentence had been confirmed,\nwrote to the Secretariat requesting such action. He was faxed a copy of the Note Verbale.\n32. On 20th November 1995 the Secretariat received a Note Verbale from the Nigerian High Commissioner\nin Banjul, attempting to justify the executions.\n33. On 21st November 1995 the Secretariat wrote a Note Verbale to the Nigerian High Commission in\nBanjul, requesting the official judgement in the Saro-Wiwa case, which had been mentioned in the Note\nVerbale.\n34. On 30th November 1995 a letter was sent to the Complainants stating that the communications would\nbe taken up by the Commission's mission to Nigeria.\n35. On 13th December 1995, the Secretariat received a letter dated 13th November 1995 from the office of\nthe Special Adviser to the Head of State, attempting to justify the executions.\n36. On 18th and 19th December 1995, the Commission held an extraordinary session on Nigeria in\nKampala.\n37. On 26th January 1996 a letter was sent to the Constitutional Rights Project informing it of the interim\nmeasures taken with regard to Ken Saro-Wiwa.\n38. At the 19th Session, held in March/April 1996 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, the Commission heard\nstatements from the government of Nigeria and the Complainants. Mr Chidi Anselm Odinkalu was duly\nauthorised to appear for the Complainants, and Mr Osah and Mr Bello appeared for the Nigerian\nGovernment. At the end of the hearing the Commission took a general view on the cases and deferred\ntaking final decision in each case pending the accomplishment of its proposed mission to Nigeria. The\nCommission proposed May 1996 as the dates for the visit. The Nigerian delegation said they will\ncommunicate these dates to the Government of Nigeria for confirmation.\n39. On 8th May 1996 the Commission wrote to the Nigerian Government, Constitutional Rights Project and\nInternational PEN informing them that a decision had been taken at the 19th Session to send a mission to\nthe country where the cases would be taken up.\n40. At the 20th Session held in Grand Bay, Mauritius, October 1996, the Commission decided to postpone\nthe final decision on the merits of the communications to the next session, awaiting the result of the\nplanned mission to Nigeria. The Commission also decided to join communication 154/96 with these\ncommunications.\n41. On 10th December 1996 the Secretariat sent letters to the Complainants informing them of the\ndecisions of the Commission.\n\n3\n\n\f42. On 10th December 1996 the Secretariat sent a Note Verbale to the government informing it of the\ndecisions of the Commission.\n43. On 29th April, the Secretariat received a letter from Mr Olisa Agbakoba entitled 'Preliminary objections\nand observations to the Mission of the Commission which visited Nigeria from March 7th-14th 1997. The\ndocument was submitted on behalf of INTERIGTS with regard to 14 communications, including this one.\n44. Among the objections raised and or observations made were: a) \"the neutrality, credibility and\nrelevance; and composition of the mission\".\n45. At its 21st Session held in April 1997, the Commission postponed taking decision on the Merits to the\nnext session, pending the submission of scholarly article and court decisions by the complainants to assist\nit in its decision. The Commission also awaits further analysis of its report of the mission to Nigeria. It must\nbe stated that Mr Chidi Odinkalu did send the article mentioned above.\n46. On 22nd May, the Complainants were informed of the Commission's decision, while the State was\ninformed on May 28th.\n47. Communication 154/96 is dated 6th November 1995 and received at the Secretariat on 4th March 1996.\n48. The communication requested the Commission to take interim measures to prevent the executions. A\nsupplementary submission was sent with the communication informing the Commission that the executions\nhad taken place on 10th November but that the communication was reaffirmed.\n49. On 13th November 1995 the Nigerian Government wrote to the Commission informing it of the\nGovernment's view of the situation.\n50. On 20th November 1995 the High Commission of Nigeria in The Gambia giving its opinion on the\nmatter.\n51. On 21st November 1995 the Commission wrote to the High Commission of Nigeria in The Gambia\nrequesting a copy of the Justice's judgement in the case.\n52. On 12th March 1996 a confirmation was sent to this effect by the Complainant.\n53. At the 19th Session in March 1996 the communication was not considered, but the Commission took a\ngeneral view of all the communications against Nigeria and deferred any decision on cases pending the\naccomplishment of its proposed mission to Nigeria.\n54. On 13th August 1996 a complete copy of the communication was sent to the government of Nigeria.\n55. On 13th August 1996 a letter was sent to the Complainant informing him of the status of the case.\n56. On 4th February 1997, the Secretariat received a letter entitled supplementary submissions with respect\nto communication No. 154/96.\n57. On 4th April, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the letter.\n58. On 29th April, the Secretariat received a letter from Mr Olisa Agbakoba entitled 'Preliminary objections\nand observations' to the Mission of the Commission which visited Nigeria from March 7th-14th 1997. The\ndocument was submitted on behalf of INTERIGHTS with regard to 14 communications, including this one.\n59. Among the objections raised and or observations made were: a) the neutrality, credibility and\nrelevance; and composition of the mission\".\n60. At its 21st Session held in April 1997, the Commission postponed taking decision on the merits to the\nnext session, pending the submission of scholarly articles and court case by the Complainants to assist it in\nits decision. The Commission also awaits further analysis of its report of the mission to Nigeria.\n61. On 22nd May, the Complainants were informed of the Commission's decision, while the State was\ninformed on May 28th.\n62. On May 27th, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant entitled 'Additional Information on\nOuster Clauses in Nigerian Law' in which he promised to furnish the Secretariat with the information\nrequested by the Commission at its 21st Session \"within the next three weeks\".\n63. From this day on the procedure is identical to communications 137/94 and 139/94.\n64. Communication 161/97 was received on 10th January 1997.\n65. On 14th January 1997 a Note Verbale with a copy of the communication was sent to the Ministry of\nExternal Affairs, copy to the Special Legal Adviser to the Head of State, the Nigerian High Commission,\nand the Embassy of Nigeria in Addis Ababa.\n66. On 23rd January 1997 an acknowledgement of receipt was sent to the Complainant.\n67. At its 21st Session held in April 1997, the Commission postponed taking decision on the merits to the\nnext session, pending the submission of scholarly articles and court case by the Complainants to assist it in\nits decision. The Commission also awaits further analysis of its report of the mission to Nigeria.\n68. On 22nd May, the Complainants were informed of the Commission's decision, while the State was\ninformed on May 28th.\n4\n\n\f69. At the 22nd Ordinary Session, the Commission postponed taking a decision on the cases pending the\ndiscussion of the Nigerian Mission report.\n70. At the 23rd Ordinary Session held in Banjul The Gambia, from 20th-29th April 1998, the Commission was\nunable to consider the communication due to lack of time.\n71. On 25th June 1998, letters were sent from the Secretariat of the Commission to all parties concerned\nregarding the status of the communications.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n72. Article 56 of the African Charter reads:\nCommunications...shall be considered if they: ...5. Are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it\nis obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged...\n73. This is just one of the 7 conditions specified by Article 56, but it is that which usually requires the most\nattention. Because Article 56 is necessarily the first considered by the Commission, before any substantive\nconsideration of communications, it has already been the subject of substantial interpretation; in the\njurisprudence of the African Commission, there are several important precedents.\n74. Specifically, in the four decisions the Commission has already taken concerning Nigeria, Article 56(5) is\nanalysed in terms of the Nigerian context. Communication 60/91 (Decision ACHPR/60/91) concerned the\nRobbery and Firearms Tribunal; Communication 87/93 (Decision ACHPR/87/93) concerned the Civil\nDisturbances Tribunal; Communication 101/93 (Decision ACHPR/101/93) concerned the Legal\nPractitioners Decree; and Communication 129/94 (ACHPR/129/94) concerned the Constitution\n(Modification and Suspension) Decree and the Political Parties (Dissolution) Decree.\n75. All of the Decrees in question in the above communications contain \"ouster\" clauses. In the case of the\nspecial tribunals, these clauses prevent the ordinary courts from taking up cases placed before the special\ntribunals or from entertaining any appeals from the decisions of the special tribunals. ( ACHPR/60/91:13\nand ACHPR/87/93:13). The Legal Practitioners Decree specifies that it cannot not be challenged in the\ncourts and that anyone attempting to do so commits a crime ( ACHPR/129/94:14 and ACHPR/129/94:15 ).\nThe Constitution Suspension and Modification legally prohibited their challenge in the Nigerian Courts (\nACHPR/129/94:14 and ACHPR/129/94:15).\n76. In all of the cases cited above, the Commission found that the ouster clauses render local remedies\nnon-existent, ineffective or illusory. They create a legal situation in which the judiciary can provide no check\non the executive branch of government. A few courts in the Lagos district have occasionally found that they\nhave jurisdiction; in 1995 the Court of Appeal in Lagos, relying on common law, found that courts should\nexamine some decrees notwithstanding ouster clauses, where the decree is \"offensive and utterly hostile to\nrationality\" (Reprinted in the Constitutional Rights Journal). It remains to be seen whether any Nigerian\ncourts will be courageous enough to follow this holding, and whether the government will abide by their\nrulings should they do so.\n77. In the present case, while the above reasoning was used in the initial decisions on admissibility, it is at\nthe present time unnecessary. In light of the fact that the subjects of the communications are now\ndeceased, it is evident that no domestic remedy can now give the complainants the satisfaction they seek.\nThe communications are thus admissible.\nMerits\n78. Article 5 of the Charter reads:\nEvery individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being and to the\nrecognition of his legal status. All forms of exploitation and degradation of man particularly slavery, slave\ntrade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and treatment shall be prohibited.\n79. Article 5 prohibits not only torture, but also cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. This includes not\nonly actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering, but which humiliate the individual or\nforce him or her to act against his will or conscience.\n5\n\n\f80. International PEN alleges that Ken Saro-Wiwa was kept in leg irons and handcuffs and subjected to\nill-treatment including beatings and being held in cells which were airless and dirty, then denied medical\nattention, during the first days of his arrest. There was no evidence of any violent action on his part or\nescape attempts that would justify holding him in irons. Communication 154/96 alleges that all the victims\nwere manacled in their cells, beaten and chained to the walls in their cells.\n81. The government has made no written submission in these cases, and has not refuted these allegations\nin its oral presentation. It is well-established jurisprudence of the Commission that where allegations go\nentirely unchallenged, it will proceed to decide on the facts presented (See, e.g., the Commission's\ndecisions in communications 59/91, 60/91, 64/92, 68/92, 78/92, 87/93 and 101/93). Thus, the\nCommission holds a violation of Article 5 of the Charter.\n82. Article 6 of the African Charter reads:\nEvery individual shall have the right to liberty and to the security of his person. No one may be deprived of\nhis freedom except for reasons and conditions previously laid down by law. In particular, no one may be\narbitrarily arrested or detained.\n83. All the victims were arrested and kept in detention for a lengthy period under the State Security\n(Detention of Persons) Act of 1984 and State Security (Detention of Persons ) Amended Decree No. 14\n(1994), that stipulates that the government can detain people without charge for as long as three months in\nthe first instance. The decree also states that the courts cannot question any such detention or in any other\nway intervene on behalf of the detainees. This decree allows the government to arbitrarily hold people\ncritical of the government for up to 3 months without having to explain themselves and without any\nopportunity for the complainant to challenge the arrest and detention before a court of law. The decree\ntherefore prima facie violates the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained protected in Article 6.\n84. The government has made no defence of this decree, either for its general validity or its justice as\napplied in this case. Thus, the Commission holds a violation of Article 6.\n85. Article 7 of the African Charter reads:\n1. Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This comprises:\nthe right to appeal to competent national organs against acts of violating his fundamental rights;\nthe right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\nthe right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;\nthe right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\n86. As regards the conduct of the trial itself, it is unnecessary for the Commission to delve into the specific\ncircumstances, because by the Commission's own precedent the tribunal was defective. As will be recalled,\nin its decision on Communication 87/93, the Commission considered that special tribunals established\nunder the Civil Disturbances Act violate Article 7(1)(d) of the African Charter, because their composition is\nat the discretion of the executive branch. Removing cases from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and\nplacing them before an extension of the executive branch necessarily compromises their impartiality, which\nis required by the African Charter. This violation of the impartiality of tribunals occurs in principle,\nregardless of the qualifications of the individuals chosen for a particular tribunal.\n87. The Note Verbale of the Nigerian High Commissioner in The Gambia points out that the tribunal was\nnot a military one, but was presided over by a judge of the Nigerian Court of Appeal, and that tribunals are\nproperly constituted in the Nigerian judicial system to deal with specific issues and for speedier\ndispensation of justice. The Note Verbale makes other specific points on the conduct of the trial, arguing for\nits fairness: the placement of evidence, its conduct in public, and the fact that some of the defendants were\nultimately acquitted.\n88. In its oral presentation at the 19th Session, the government argued that the confirmation of sentence\ngiven by the state governors is an adequate appeal.\n89. The Commission might cite opposing facts, casting doubt upon the fairness of the tribunal. For\nexample, The Head of State personally chose its members consisting of three instead of the five persons\nrequired by the Civil Disturbances Act. When defence counsel wrote to the Chief Judge of the Federal High\nCourt on 27th November 1994 for information on when the trial would begin, the judge responded, \"This\nCourt has nothing to do about the Tribunal. It is the responsibility of the Presidency\".\n90. There is a great deal of information available from Nigerian and international sources on the day-to-day\nconduct of the tribunal and the significance of its legal rulings. Yet in reaching its decision, the Commission\nneed only rely upon its earlier holding, made in less politically charged circumstances, that the special\n6\n\n\ftribunals established under the Civil Disturbances Act are in violation of the African Charter. As a result, it\nfinds that Ken Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants were denied the right to a fair trial, in violation of Article\n7(1)(d).\n91. Section 7 of the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunals) Decree No. 2 of 1987 decides that the confirming\nauthority of judgments given under the act is the PRC, that is the ruling council of the Federal Military\ngovernment, the members of which are exclusively members of the armed forces.\n92. Section 8(1) of the same Decree stipulates:\nThe validity of any decision, sentence, judgement, confirmation, direction, notice or order given or made, as\nthe case may be, or any other thing whatsoever done under this Act shall not be inquired into by any court\nof law.\n93. In this case, it is not safe to view the Provisional Ruling Council as impartial or independent. Section\n8(1) effectively ousts all possibility of appeal to the ordinary courts. Thus, the accused persons had no\npossibility of appeal to a competent national organ, and the Commission finds a violation of Article 7(1)(a).\n94. Article 26 of the African Charter reads:\nStates parties to the present Charter shall have the duty to guarantee the independence of the Courts... .\n95. As stated above, the Special Tribunal and the Provisional Ruling Council are not independent. The\nCommission also finds that there is a violation of Article 26 of the African Charter.\n96. The government has not contradicted the allegations contained in communication 154/96 that at the\nconviction in October 1995 the Tribunal itself admitted that there was no direct evidence linking the\naccused to the act of the murders, but held that they had each failed to establish that they did not commit\nthe crime alleged. Communication 154/96 has also affirmed that prior to and during the trial, leading\nrepresentatives of the government pronounced MOSOP and the accused guilty of the crimes at various\npress conferences and before the United Nations. As the allegations have not been contradicted, the\nCommission find a violation of the right to be presumed innocent, Article 7(1)(b)\n97. Initially, the accused were defended by a team of lawyers of their own choice. According to\nCommunication 154/96 and Communication 139/94, this team withdrew from the case because of\nharassment, both in the conduct of the trial and in their professional and private lives outside.\nCommunication 154/96 alleges that two of the lawyers were seriously assaulted by soldiers claiming to be\nacting on the instruction of the military officer responsible for the trial. On three occasions defence lawyers\nwere arrested and detained and two of the lawyers had their offices searched. When these lawyers\nwithdrew from the case, the harassment subsided.\n98. After the withdrawal of their chosen counsel, the accused were defended by a team assigned by the\nTribunal. However, this team also resigned, complaining of harassment. After that, the accused declined to\naccept a new team appointed by the Tribunal, and the court proceedings were closed without the accused\nhaving legal representation for the duration.\n99. Communication 154/96 also claims that the defence was denied access to the evidence on which the\nprosecution was based and that files and documents which were required by the accused for their defence\nwere removed from their residences and offices when they were searched by security forces on different\noccasions during the trial.\n100. The government claims that: \"Their [the accused] defence team which comprised sly human rights\nactivists such as Femi Falana and Gani Fawehinmi, known to be more disposed towards melodrama than\nthe actual defence of their clients, inexplicably withdrew from the Special Tribunal at a crucial stage of the\ntrial in order to either play to the gallery or delay and frustrate the process\".\n101. This statement does not contradict the allegations of Communication 154/96, that two different\ndefence teams were harassed into quitting the defence of the accused persons; it merely attributed\nmalicious motives to the defence. The government has not responded to the allegations of withholding\nevidence from the defence. The Commission therefore finds itself with no alternative but to conclude that a\nviolation of Article 7(1)(c) has occurred.\n102. Article 4 of the African Charter reads:\nHuman beings are inviolable. Every human being shall be entitled to respect for his life and the integrity of\nhis person. No one may be arbitrarily deprived of this right.\n103. Given that the trial which ordered the executions itself violates Article 7, any subsequent\nimplementation of sentences renders the resulting deprivation of life arbitrary and in violation of Article 4.\n7\n\n\fThe violation is compounded by the fact that there were pending communications before the African\nCommission at the time of the executions, and the Commission had requested the government to avoid\ncausing any \"irreparable prejudice\" to the subjects of the communications before the Commission had\nconcluded it consideration. Executions had been stayed in Nigeria in the past on the invocation by the\nCommission of its rule on provisional measures (Rule 109 now Rule 111) and the Commission had hoped\nthat a similar situation will obtain in the case of Ken Saro-Wiwa and others. It is a matter of deep regret that\nthis did not happen.\n104. The protection of the right to life in Article 4 also includes a duty for the state not to purposefully let a\nperson die while in its custody. Here at least one of the victims' lives was seriously endangered by the\ndenial of medication during detention. Thus, there are multiple violations of Article 4.\n105. Article 11 of the African Charter provides:\nEvery individual shall have the right to assemble freely with others...\n106. Communication 154/96 alleges that Article 11 was violated because the murder trial directly followed\npublic meetings of MOSOP. In its judgement, the Tribunal held that the condemned persons \"created the\nfire that consumed the four Ogoni chiefs\" by wrongfully organising election campaign rallies and permitting\na large crowd of fanatical MOSOP and NYCOP youths to congregate. It appears that the Tribunal holds the\naccused responsible for the murders because they organised the rally after which the murders took place,\nalthough Ken Saro-Wiwa for one was prevented by government officials from attending the rally. The\nCommission has considerable difficulty with this position as it can adversely affect the right to assembly.\n107. Article 10(1) of the African Charter reads:\nEvery individual shall have the right to free association provided that he abides by the law.\n108. Communication 154/96 alleges that Article 10(1) was violated because the victims were tried and\nconvicted for their opinions, as expressed through their work in MOSOP. In its judgement, the Tribunal held\nthat by their membership in MOSOP, the condemned persons were responsible for the murders, guilt by\nassociation, it would seem furthermore that, government officials at different times during the trial declared\nMOSOP and the accused guilty of the charges, without waiting for the official judgement. This\ndemonstrates a clear prejudice against the organisation MOSOP, which the government has done nothing\nto defend or justify. Therefore the Commission finds a violation of Article 10(1).\n109. Article 9(2) of the African Charter reads:\nEvery individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinions within the law.\n110. There is a close relationship between the rights expressed in the Articles 9(2), 10(1) and 11.\nCommunication 154 alleges that the actual reason for the trial and the ultimate death sentences was the\npeaceful expression of views by the accused persons. The victims were disseminating information and\nopinions on the rights of the people who live in the oil producing area of Ogoniland, through MOSOP and\nspecifically a rally. These allegations have not been contradicted by the government, which has already\nbeen shown to be highly prejudiced against MOSOP, without giving concrete justifications. MOSOP was\nfounded specifically for the expression of views of the people who live in the oil producing areas, and the\nrally was organised with this in view. The Government's actions is inconsistent with Article 9(2) implicit\nwhen it violated Articles 10(1) and 11.\n111. Article 16 of the Charter reads:\n1. Every individual shall have the right to enjoy the best attainable state of physical and mental health.\n2. States parties to the present Charter shall take the necessary measures to protect the health of their\npeople and to ensure that they receive medical attention when they are sick.\n112. The responsibility of the government is heightened in cases where an individual is in its custody and\ntherefore someone whose integrity and well-being is completely dependent on the actions of the\nauthorities. The State has a direct responsibility in this case. Despite requests for hospital treatment made\nby a qualified prison doctor, these were denied to Ken Saro-Wiwa, causing his health to suffer to the point\nwhere his life was endangered. The government has not denied this allegation in any way. This is a\nviolation of Article16.\n113. Nigeria has been a State Party to the African Charter for over a decade, and is thus bound by Article 1\nof the African Charter.\n8\n\n\f114. The Commission assists States parties to implement their obligations under the Charter. Rule 111 of\nthe Commission's Rules of Procedure (revised) aims at preventing irreparable damage being caused to a\ncomplainant before the Commission. Execution in the face of the invocation of Rule 111 defeats the\npurpose of this important rule. The Commission had hoped that the Government of Nigeria would respond\npositively to its request for a stay of execution pending the former's determination of the communication\nbefore it.\n115. This is a blot on the legal system of Nigeria that will not be easy to erase. To have carried out the\nexecution in the face of pleas to the contrary by the Commission and world opinion is something that we\npray will never happen again. That it is a violation of the Charter is an understatement.\n116. The Nigerian Government itself recognises that human rights are no longer solely a matter of domestic\nconcern. The African Charter was drafted and acceded to voluntarily by African States wishing to ensure\nthe respect of human rights on this continent. Once ratified, States Parties to the Charter are legally bound\nto its provisions. A state not wishing to abide by the African Charter might have refrained from ratification.\nOnce legally bound, however, a state must abide by the law in the same way an individual must.\n\nHolding\n\nFor the above reasons, the Commission\n\nDecides that there has been a violation of Articles 5 and 16 in relation to Ken Saro-Wiwa's detention in\n1993 and his treatment in detention in 1994 and 1995;\nDecides that there has been a violation of Article 6 in relation to the detention of all the victims under the\nState Security (Detention of Persons) Act of 1984 and State Security (Detention of Persons) Amended\nDecree No. 14 (1994). The government therefore has the obligation to annul these Decrees;\nReiterates its decision on communication 87/93 that there has been a violation of Article 7(1)(d) and with\nregard to the establishment of the Civil Disturbances Tribunal. In ignoring this decision, Nigeria has\nviolation Article 1 of the Charter;\nDecides that there has been a violation of Article 4 and 7 (1) (a), (b)(c) and (d) in relation to the conduct of\nthe trial and the execution of the victims;\nHolds that there has been a violation of Articles 9(2), 10(1) and 11, 26, 16;\n\nHolds that in ignoring its obligations to institute provisional measures, Nigeria has violated Article 1.\nBanjul, 31st October 1998.\n\n9\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"activity_report":"","keywords":"","instruments_type":"","date":"","outcome":"","country":"2","language":"","mechanism":"1","date_issued":"","type_of_document":""},"published":true},{"_id":"c955fe0ecf85c09bd948dde4500036e4","title":"147 95 149 96 Sir Dawda K.

Jawara / Gambia (The)\nSummary of Facts\nCommunication 147/95\n1. The Complainant is the former Head of State of the Republic of The Gambia. He alleges that after the\nMilitary coup of July 1994, that overthrew his government, there has been \"blatant abuse of power by ... the\nmilitary junta\". The military government is alleged to have initiated a reign of terror, intimidation and\narbitrary detention.\n2. The Complainant further alleges the abolition of the Bill of Rights as contained in the 1970 Gambian\nConstitution by Military Decree No. 30/31, ousting the competence of the courts to examine or question the\nvalidity of any such decree.\n3. The communication alleges the banning of political parties and of ministers of the former civilian\ngovernment from taking part in any political activity. The communication alleges restrictions on freedom of\nexpression, movement and religion. These restrictions were manifested, according to the complainant, by\nthe arrest and detention of people without charge, kidnappings, torture and the burning of a mosque.\n4. He further alleges that two former Ministers of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC)\nwere killed by the regime, asserting that the restoration of the death penalty through Decree No. 52 means,\n\"the arsenal of the AFPRC is now complete\".\n5. He also alleges that not less than fifty soldiers were killed in cold blood and buried in mass graves by the\nmilitary government during what the Complainant terms \"a staged-managed attempted coup\". Several\nmembers of the armed forces were allegedly detained (some for up to six months), without trial, following\nthe introduction of Decree No. 3 of July 1994. This Decree gives the Minister of Interior the power to detain\nand to extend the period of detention ad infinitum. The Decree further prohibits the proceedings of habeas\ncorpus on any detention issued under it.\n6. The Complainant alleges further that Decree No. 45 of June 1995, the National Intelligence Agency (NIA)\nDecree empowers the Minister of Interior or his designate to issue search warrants, authorise interference\nwith correspondence, be it wireless or electronic.\n7. Finally, the communication alleges disregard for the judiciary and contempt of court following the\nregime's disregard of a court order; the imposition of retroactive legislation following the Economic Crimes\n(Specified Offences) Decree of 25th November 1994, thus infringing on the rule and the due process of law.\nCommunication 149/96\n8. Communication 149/96 alleges violation of the right to life, freedom from torture and the right to a fair\ntrial. The Complainant alleges that not less than fifty soldiers have been summarily executed by the\nGambian military government and buried in mass graves following an alleged attempted coup on 11th\nNovember 1994.\n9. The Complainant attaches the names of thirteen of the fifty soldiers alleged to have been killed and\nfurther alleges that a former Finance Minister, Mr Koro Ceesay was killed by the government. He attaches\na document from a former member of the AFPRC, Captain Sadibu Hydara, to support this allegation.\n10. He went further to state that a former AFPRC member and former Interior Minister did not die from high\nblood pressure as claimed by the government but was tortured to death.\nThe Government's Response\n11. In its submission on the question of admissibility, the government raised the following objections:\n12. The first point raised is what the government called lack of 'proofs in support', claiming that a\ncommunication should only be received by the Commission if the individual alleges, 'with proofs in support'\na serious or massive case of violations of human and peoples' rights.\n13. The government asserts that the decrees complained of may on their face value be seen to be contrary\nto the provisions in the Charter, but claims that they must be \"studied and placed in the context of the\nchanged circumstances in The Gambia\". Commenting on the freedom of liberty, the government claimed it\nwas acting in conformity with laws previously laid down by domestic legislation. The government claims that\n1\n\n\fthe decrees do not prohibit the enjoyment of freedoms; they are merely there to secure peace and stability,\nand only those who want to disrupt the peace will be arrested and detained.\n14. The submission further claims that since the take-over, not a single individual has been deliberately\nkilled; and that during the counter - coup of 11th November 1994, soldiers of both sides lost their lives due\nmainly to the fact that the rebels were fighting back with soldiers loyal to the government.\n15. The government also claims that Mr Koro Ceesay and Mr Sadibu Hydara alleged to have been killed by\nthe government died from an accident and natural causes, respectively. Post-mortem reports on the two\ndeaths are attached.\n16. The government further pointed out that the communication does not fulfil some of the conditions laid\ndown in Article 56 of the Charter. Specifically, that the communications fails to meet the conditions set\ndown in sub-article 4 and Article 56(5), which state that communications:\nArticle 56(4)...are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media;\nArticle 56(5)...are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any unless it is obvious that this procedure is\nunduly prolonged.\n\nComplaint\n17. The Complainant alleges violation of the following Articles of the Charter: Articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7(1)(d),\n7(2), 9(1), 9(2), 10(1), 11, 12(1), 12(2), 20(1) and 26.\n\nProcedure\n18. Communication 147/95 is dated 6th September 1995 and was received on 30th November 1995 at the\nSecretariat of the Commission.\n19. Communication 149/96 was received on 12th January 1996 at the Secretariat of the Commission.\n20. At the 19th Session in March 1996, the Commission decided to be seized of the communication and to\nnotify the government accordingly, and stated that a decision on admissibility would be taken at the 20th\nSession in October 1996.\n21. At its 21st Session in April 1997, the Commission decided to renumber the communication as 147/95 to\nreflect the length of time it has been with the Commission, it also decided to join the communication with\n149/96 and declare both of them admissible. The Commission also requested further information from both\nsides and stated that a decision on the merits would be taken at its 22nd Session.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n22. Article 56 of the African Charter governs the admissibility of communications by the Commission. This\narticle lays down seven conditions that, under normal circumstances must be fulfilled for a communication\nto be admissible. Have the seven, the government claims that two conditions have not been fulfilled;\nnamely; Article 56(4) and 56(5).\n23. Article 56(4) of the Charter provides that communications '... are not based exclusively on news\ndisseminated through the mass media'.\n24. The government claims that the communication should be declared inadmissible because it is based\nexclusively on news disseminated through the mass media, and specifically made reference to the attached\nletter of Captain Ebou Jallow. While it would be dangerous to rely exclusively on news disseminated from\nthe mass media, it would be equally damaging if the Commission were to reject a communication because\nsome aspects of it are based on news disseminated through the mass media. This is borne out of the fact\nthat the Charter makes use of the word \"exclusively\".\n25. There is no doubt that the media remains the most important, if not the only source of information. It is\ncommon knowledge that information on human rights violations is always gotten from the media. The\ngenocide in Rwanda, the human rights abuses in Burundi, Zaire, Congo, to name but a few, were revealed\nby the media.\n2\n\n\f26. The issue therefore should not be whether the information was gotten from the media, but whether the\ninformation is correct. Did the Complainant try to verify the truth about these allegations? Did he have the\nmeans or was it possible for him to do so, given the circumstances of his case?\n27. The communication under consideration cannot be said to be based exclusively on news disseminated\nthrough the mass media because the communication is not exclusively based on Captain Jallow's letter.\nThe Complainant alleges extra-judicial execution and has attached the names of some of those he alleges\nhave been killed. Captain Jallow's letter made no mention of this fact.\n28. Article 56(5) of the Charter states that communications '... are sent after exhausting local remedies, if\nany, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged'.\n29. The government also claims that the author has not attempted to exhaust local remedies. The\ngovernment claims that the author should have sent his complaint to the police who would in turn have\ninvestigated the allegations and prosecuted the offenders 'in a court of law'.\n30. This rule is one of the most important conditions for admissibility of communications, there is no doubt\ntherefore, that in almost all the cases, the first requirement looked at by both the Commission and the state\nconcerned is the exhaustion of local remedies.\n31. The rationale of the local remedies rule both in the Charter and other international instruments is to\nensure that before proceedings are brought before an international body, the State concerned must have\nhad the opportunity to remedy the matter through its own local system. This prevents the Commission from\nacting as a court of first instance rather than a body of last resort.1 Three major criteria could be deduced\nfrom the practice of the Commission in determining this rule, namely: the remedy must be available,\neffective and sufficient.\n32. A remedy is considered available if the petitioner can pursue it without impediment, it is deemed\neffective if it offers a prospect of success, and it is found sufficient if it is capable of redressing the\ncomplaint.\n33. The government's assertion of non-exhaustion of local remedies will therefore be looked at in this light.\nAs aforementioned, a remedy is considered available only if the applicant can make use of it in the\ncircumstance of his case. The applicants in cases Nos. ACHPR/60/91, ACHPR/87/93, ACHPR/101/93\nand ACHPR/129/94 had their communications declared admissible by the Commission because the\ncompetence of the ordinary courts had been ousted either by decrees or the establishment of special\ntribunals.\n34. The Commission has stressed that, remedies, the availability of which is not evident, cannot be invoked\nby the State to the detriment of the complainant. Therefore, in a situation where the jurisdiction of the courts\nhave been ousted by decrees whose validity cannot be challenged or questioned, as is the position with the\ncase under consideration, local remedies are deemed not only to be unavailable but also non- existent.\n35. The existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing\nwhich, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Therefore, if the applicant cannot turn to the\njudiciary of his country because of generalised fear for his life (or even those of his relatives), local\nremedies would be considered to be unavailable to him.\n36. The Complainant in this case had been overthrown by the military, he was tried in absentia, former\nMinisters and Members of Parliament of his government have been detained and there was terror and fear\nfor lives in the country. It would be an affront to common sense and logic to require the Complainant to\nreturn to his country to exhaust local remedies.\n37. There is no doubt that there was a generalised fear perpetrated by the regime as alleged by the\nComplainant. This created an atmosphere not only in the mind of the author but also in the minds of right\nthinking people that returning to his country at that material moment, for whatever reason, would be risky to\nhis life. Under such circumstances, domestic remedies cannot be said to have been available to the\ncomplainant.\n38. According to the established case law of the Commission, a remedy that has no prospect of success\ndoes not constitute an effective remedy. The prospect of seizing the national courts, whose jurisdiction\nhave been ousted by decrees, in order to seek redress is nil. This fact is reinforced by the government's\nresponse of 8th March 1996, Note Verbale No. PA 203/232/01/(97-ADJ), in which it stated that 'The\nGambian Government...does not intend to spend valuable time responding to baseless and frivolous\nallegations by a deposed despot...'\n39. As to whether there were sufficient remedies, one can deduce from the above analysis that there were\nno remedies capable of redressing the complaints of the authors.\n\n3\n\n\f40. Considering the fact that the regime at that material time controlled all the arms of government and had\nlittle regard for the judiciary, as was demonstrated by its disregard of a court order in the T. K Motors' case,\nand considering further that the Court of Appeal of The Gambia in the case of Pa Salla Jagne v The State,\nruled that 'Now there are no human rights laws or goals and objective laws in the country', it would be\nreversing the clock of justice to request the Complainant to attempt local remedies.\n41. It should also be noted that the government also claims that the communication lacks 'proofs in\nsupport'. The position of the Commission has always been that a communication must establish a prima\nfacie evidence of violation. It must specify the provisions of the Charter alleged to have been violated. The\nstate also claims that the Commission is allowed under the Charter to take action only on cases that reveal\na series of serious or massive violations of human rights.\n42. This is an erroneous proposition. Apart from Article 47 and Article 49 of the Charter, which empower the\nCommission to consider inter-state complaints, Article 55 of the Charter provides for the consideration of\n\"communications other than those of States Parties\". Further to this, Article 56 of the Charter stipulates the\nconditions for consideration of such communications (see also Chapter XVII[sic] of the Rules of Procedure\nentitled \"Procedure for the Consideration of The Communications Received in Conformity with Article 55 of\nthe Charter\"). In any event, the practice of the Commission has been to consider communications even if\nthey do not reveal a series of serious or massive violations. It is out of such useful exercise that the\nCommission has, over the years, been able to build up its case law and jurisprudence.\n43. The argument that the action of the government is in conformity with regulations previously laid down\nby law is unfounded: the Commission decided in its decision on communication 101/93, with respect to\nfreedom of association, that, \"competent authorities should not enact provisions which limit the exercise of\nthis freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional provisions or undermine\nfundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution and international human rights standards\". And more\nimportantly, the Commission in its Resolution on the Right to Freedom of Association had also reiterated\nthat: \"The regulation of the exercise of the right to freedom of association should be consistent with States'\nobligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights\". It follows that any law, which is\npleaded for curtailing the enjoyment of any of the rights provided for in the Charter, must meet this\nrequirement.\n\nFor these reasons, the Commission declared the communications admissible.\nMerits\n44. The Complainant alleges that by suspending the Bill of Rights in the 1970 Gambian Constitution, the\ngovernment violated Articles 1 and 2 of the African Charter.\n45. Article 1 of the Charter provides that \"The Member States ... parties to the present Charter shall\nrecognise the rights, duties and freedoms enshrined in this Charter...\", while Article 2 reads: \"Every\nindividual shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognised and guaranteed in the\npresent Charter...\".\n46. Article 1 gives the Charter the legally binding character always attributed to international treaties of this\nsort. Therefore a violation of any provision of the Charter automatically means a violation of Article 1. If a\nState party to the Charter fails to recognise the provisions of the same, there is no doubt that it is in\nviolation of this Article. Its violation, therefore, goes to the root of the Charter.\n47. The Republic of the Gambia ratified the Charter on 6th June 1983. In its first periodic report to the\nCommission in 1992, the Gambian government asserted that \"Most of the rights set out in the Charter have\nbeen provided for in Chapter 3, Sections 13 to 30 of the 1970 Constitution...The Constitution predicts the\nGambian accession to the covenants, but in fact gave legal effect to some of the provisions of the Charter\".\nThis therefore means that the Gambian government gave recognition to some of the provisions of the\nCharter (i.e. those contained in chapter 3 of its Constitution), and incorporated them into its domestic law.\n48. By suspending Chapter 3, (the Bill of Rights), the government therefore restricted the enjoyment of the\nrights guaranteed therein, and, by implication, the rights enshrined in the Charter.\n49. It should however be stated that the suspension of the Bill of Rights does not ipso facto mean the\nsuspension of the domestic effect of the Charter. In Communication 129/94, the Commission held that \"the\nobligation of ... a government remains unaffected by the purported revocation of the domestic effect of the\n4\n\n\fCharter\".\n50. The suspension of the Bill of Rights and consequently the application of the Charter was not only a\nviolation of Article 1 but also a restriction on the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms enshrined in the\nCharter, thus violating Article 2 of the Charter as well.\n51. Article 4 of the Charter states that \"Every human being shall be entitled to respect for his life and the\nintegrity of his person. No one may be arbitrarily deprived of this right''.\n52. While the Complainant alleges that there have been extra-judicial killings, no concrete evidence was\nadduced to support this allegation. The military government has provided official post-mortem reports on\nthe causes of the deaths of Messrs. Koro Ceesay and Sadibu Hydara. The government does not dispute\nthe fact that soldiers died during the counter coup in November 1994, but claims, \"soldiers of both sides lost\ntheir lives due mainly to the fact that the rebels were fighting back with soldiers loyal to the government\". It\nalso claims that since the take-over, not a single individual has been deliberately killed.\n53. It is not for the Commission to verify the authenticity of the post-mortem reports or the truth of the\ngovernment's defence. The burden is on the Complainant to furnish the Commission with evidence of his\nallegations. In the absence of concrete proof, the Commission cannot hold the latter to be in violation of\nArticle 4 of the Charter.\n54. Article 5 of the Charter reads: \"... All forms of ... torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and\ntreatment shall be prohibited\".\n55. The Complainant alleges that the military perpetrated a reign of terror, intimidation and torture when it\nseized power. While there is evidence of intimidation, arrests and detentions, there is no independent\nreport of torture.\n56. The Complainant further alleges that detention of persons incommunicado and preventing them from\nseeing their relatives constitutes torture. The State has refuted this claim and has challenged the\nComplainant to verify the truth from those who were detained. To date, the Commission has received no\nevidence from the complainant. In the absence of proof therefore, the Commission cannot hold the\ngovernment to be in violation of Article 5. In this regard, the Commission is relying on its decision in\ncommunication ACHPR/60/91: 27 [sic]* where it held that \" without specific information as to the nature of\nthe acts themselves, the Commission is thus unable to find a violation of Article 5\".\n57. Article 6 of the Charter reads: \"Every individual shall have the right to liberty and to the security of his\nperson. No one may be deprived of this freedom except for reasons and conditions previously laid down by\nlaw. In particular, no one may be arbitrarily arrested\".\n58. The Military government has not refuted the allegations of arbitrary arrests and detentions, but has\ndefended its position by stating that, its action must be \"studied and placed in the context of the changed\ncircumstances in The Gambia\". It also claims that it is acting within the confines of legislation 'previously\nlaid down by law', as required by the wordings of Article 6 of the Charter.\n59. The Commission in its decision on communication 101/93 laid down a general principle with respect to\nfreedom of association that \"competent authorities should not enact provisions which limit the exercise of\nthis freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional provisions or undermine\nfundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution or international human rights standards\" . This principle\ntherefore applies not only to freedom of association but also to all other rights and freedoms. For a State to\navail itself of this plea, it must show that such a law is consistent with its obligations under the Charter. The\nCommission finds the arrests and incommunicado detention of the aforementioned persons inconsistent\nwith Gambia's obligations under the Charter. They constitute arbitrary deprivation of their liberty and thus a\nviolation of Article 6 of the Charter. Decree No. 3 is, therefore, contrary to the spirit of Article 6.\n60. Article 7(1)(d) of the Charter reads: Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This\ncomprises:... the right to be tried within a reasonable period of time by an impartial court or tribunal.\n61. Given that the Minister of Interior could detain anyone without trial for up to six months, and could\nextend the period ad infinitum, his powers in this case, are analogous to that of a court, and with all intents\nand purposes, he is more likely to use his discretion at the detriment of the detainees, who are already in a\ndisadvantaged position. The victims will be at the mercy of the Minister who, in this case, will render favour\nrather than vindicating a right. This power granted to the Minister renders valueless the provision enshrined\nin Article 7(1)(d) of the Charter.\n62. Article 7(2) of the Charter reads:\nNo one may be condemned for an act or omission which did not constitute a legally punishable offence at\nthe time it was committed. No penalty may be inflicted for an offence for which no provision was made at\n5\n\n\fthe time it was committed.\n63. This provision is a general prohibition on retroactivity. It is to ensure that, citizens at all times are fully\naware of the state of the law under which they are living. The Economic Crimes (Specified Offences)\nDecree of 25th November 1994, which was deemed to have come into force in July 1994, is therefore, a\nserious violation of this right.\n64. Article 9 of the Charter reads:\n1.\n2. Every individual shall have the right to receive information.\n3. Every individual shall have the right to express and disseminate his opinion within the law.\n65. The government did not provide any defence to the allegations of arrests, detentions, expulsions and\nintimidation of journalists, made by the Complainant. The intimidation and arrest or detention of journalists\nfor articles published and questions asked deprives not only the journalists of their rights to freely express\nand disseminate their opinions, but also the public, of the right to information. This action is clearly a breach\nof the provisions of Article 9 of the Charter.\n66. The Complainant alleges that political parties have been banned, and that an Independent Member of\nParliament and his supporters were arrested for planning a peaceful demonstration. In addition, Ministers\nand Members of Parliament in the former regime have been banned from taking part in any political activity\nand some of them restricted from traveling out of the country; with a maximum sentence of three years for\nany default.\n67. The imposition of the ban on former Ministers and Members of Parliament is in contravention of their\nrights to participate freely in the government of their country provided for under Article 13(1) of the Charter.\nArticle 13(1) reads: Every citizen shall have the right to participate freely in the government of his country,\neither directly or through freely chosen representatives in accordance with the provisions of the law.\n68. Also, the banning of political parties is a violation of the Complainants' rights to freedom of association\nguaranteed under Article 10(1) of the Charter. In its decision on communication 101/93, the Commission\nstated a general principle on this right, to the effect that \"competent authorities should not enact provisions\nwhich limit the exercise of this freedom. The competent authorities should not override constitutional\nprovisions or undermine fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution and international human rights\nstandards\". And more importantly, the Commission in its Resolution on the Right to Freedom of Association\nhad also reiterated that: \"The regulation of the exercise of the right to freedom of association should be\nconsistent with States' obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights\". This principle\ndoes not apply to freedom of association alone but to all other rights and freedoms enshrined in the\nCharter, including, the right to freedom of assembly. Article 10(1) provides:\nEvery individual shall have the right to free association provided that he abides by the law.\n69. The Commission also finds the ban an encroachment on the right to freedom of assembly guaranteed\nby Article 11 of the Charter. Article 11 reads:\nEvery individual shall have the right to assemble freely with others\n70. The restrictions to travel placed on the former Ministers and Members of Parliament is also a violation\nof their right to freedom of movement and the right of ingress and egress provided for under Article 12 of\nthe Charter. Article 12 provides: (1) Every individual shall have the right to freedom of movement and\nresidence within the borders of a state provided he abides by the law. (2) Every individual shall have the\nright to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. This right may only be subject to\nrestrictions, provided for by law for the protection of national security, law and order, public health or\nmorality.\n71. Section 62 of the Gambian Constitution of 1970 provides for elections based on universal suffrage, and\nSection 85(4) made it mandatory for elections to be held within at most five years. Since independence in\n1965, The Gambia has always had a plurality of parties participating in elections. This was temporarily\nhalted in 1994 when the military seized power.\n72. The Complainant alleges that the right of Gambian people to self-determination has been violated. He\nclaims that the policy that the people freely choose to determine their political status, since independence\nhas been \"hijacked\" by the military. That the military has imposed itself on the people.\n6\n\n\f73. It is true that the military regime came to power by force, albeit, peacefully. This was not through the will\nof the people who have known only the ballot box since independence, as a means of choosing their\npolitical leaders. The military coup was therefore a grave violation of the right of Gambian people to freely\nchoose their government as entrenched in Article 20(1) of the Charter. Article 20(1) provides:\nAll peoples shall ... freely determine their political status... according to the policy they have freely chosen. 2\n74. The rights and freedoms of individuals enshrined in the Charter can only be fully realised if\ngovernments provide structures which enable them to seek redress if they are violated. By ousting the\ncompetence of the ordinary courts to handle human rights cases, and ignoring court judgements, the\nGambian military government demonstrated clearly that the courts were not independent. This is a violation\nof Article 26 of the Charter. Article 26 of the Charter reads:\nStates Parties to the Charter shall have the duty to guarantee the independence of the Courts...and shall\nallow the establishment and improvement of appropriate national institutions entrusted with the promotion\nand protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the present Charter.\n\nDecision of the African Commission\n\nFor the above reasons, the Commission\nHolds a violation of the following provisions of the Charter: Articles 1, 2, 6,7(1)(d), 7(2), 9(1), 9(2), 10(1),\n11, 12(1), 12(2), 20(1) and 26 of the Charter (for the period within which the violations occurred).\nRequests the Government of The Gambia to bring its laws in conformity with the provisions of the Charter.\n\nAlgiers, Algeria, 11th May 2000.\n\nFootnotes\n* Editor's note: Decision 60/91 has only 14 paragraphs in English and in French.

The Complainant alleges that sometime in the second quarter of 1998 there was an international armed\nconflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia that led to the beginning of active hostilities between the two\ncountries.\n2. During this period it is alleged by the Complainant that thousands of persons of Ethiopian nationality\nwere expelled from Eritrea, either directly or constructively by the creation of conditions in which they had\nno choice other than to leave Eritrea. In particular, over 2,500 were forcibly expelled and dumped at the\nborder where there was ferocious fighting and heavily infested with anti-personnel land mines.\n3. It is also alleged that between June 1998 and July 1999, more than sixty one thousand people of\nEritrean ethnic descent who are legal residents or citizens of Ethiopia were deported from Ethiopia. Most of\nthese are urban deportees.\n4. The Complainant asserts that in both cases, thousands of persons of Ethiopian origin and those of\nEritrean origin were arrested and interned in Eritrea and Ethiopia respectively under harsh conditions with\nno visitation rights for their families, no food, clothing and toilet facilities for extended periods of time.\n5. The Complainant alleges that some Ethiopian women and young girls were tortured and raped in the\naffected areas by Eritrean soldiers.\n6. The Complainant also alleges that most of the deportees were subjected to cruel, inhuman and\ndegrading treatment. Furthermore, the governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia arbitrarily deprived most of the\ndeportees [of] their property.\n7. Specifically in the case of those persons deported by the government of Eritrea, some deportees were\nforced to work without salaries in exchange for protection. Yet others were forced out of their rental\naccommodation, suffering forcible eviction and homelessness as a result.\n8. While in the case of those persons deported by the government of Ethiopia, the deportees, prior to their\ndeportation were required to transfer their rights over their property in Ethiopia by a power of attorney to a\nlegal agent. In compliance with this, husbands often designated their wives as their legal agents, only to\nfind that their wives were given a month or two to sell their properties and were then deported a week or\ntwo after they were told to sell. In effect, the deportation was accompanied in most cases by an\nexpropriation of the property of the deportees. In some cases some deportees also had their rental\nproperties taken over. Some bank accounts were frozen, and some savings books were destroyed, making\nit impossible for the deportees or their designated agents to gain access to such savings.\n9. The Complainant claims that while effecting the said deportations, parents and children were forcibly\nseparated without any provision for the care, feeding, and housing of the children. As at the time of\nsubmission of the complaints, neither parents nor children can travel across the Eritrean-Ethiopian border\nand even telephone communication is impractical.\n\nComplaint\n10. The Complainant alleges violations of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7(1), 12(1), (2), (4) and (5), 14, 15, 16 and\n18(1) of the African Charter.\n\nProcedure\n11. The complaint lodged by INTERIGHTS against Eritrea and Ethiopia was received at the Secretariat of\nthe African Commission on 5th October 1999.\n12. At its 26th Ordinary Session held in Kigali, Rwanda, the African Commission decided to be seized of\ncommunications 233/99 and 234/99 and requested the parties to furnish it with additional information on its\n1\n\n\fadmissibility in accordance with Article 56 of the Charter.\n13. On 17th January 2000, the Secretariat conveyed the above decision to the parties and forwarded a copy\nof the summary of the communication and the original text of the complaint together with the documents\nattached thereto.\n14. On 30th April 2000, during the 27th Ordinary Session of the African Commission, the Allard K.\nLowenstein International Human Rights Law Clinic at the Yale Law School in the United States submitted\nan amicus curiae brief to the African Commission on the complaint brought against Ethiopia.\n15. At its 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria, the African Commission heard the representatives of the\nparties on the admissibility of the case. It declared both communications admissible and requested parties\nto submit their arguments on the merits. The various parties were informed accordingly of the decision of\nthe African Commission.\n16. At its 28th Ordinary Session held in Cotonou, Benin, the African Commission heard both parties.\n17. At its 29th Ordinary Session held in Libya, the African Commission heard both parties and decided to\nconsolidate communications 233/99 and 234/99. The African Commission deferred consideration both\ncommunications on the merits to the 30th Ordinary Session and invited parties to the communications\n233/99 and 234/99 to submit arguments for the purpose of clarifications in terms of Rule 104 of the Rules of\nProcedure of the African Commission:\n1. On the desirability or otherwise of considering the communications under the provisions of Article 47\nto Article 54 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights on communications between\nStates and to follow the procedure laid down thereunder;\n2. On the extent to which matters covered by the complaint are the subject of the Peace Agreement\nbetween the Government of Democratic Federal Republic of Ethiopia and the Government of State\nof Eritrea signed in Algiers on 12th December 2000, including the mechanism for the consideration\nof claims by individuals in either State whose citizenship may be in dispute Article 5(8)\n× Article 5.\n8) Claims shall be submitted to the Commission by each of the parties on its own behalf and on\nbehalf of its nationals, including both natural and juridical persons. All claims submitted to the\nCommission shall be filed no later than one year from the effective date of this agreement. Except\nfor claims submitted to another mutually agreed settlement mechanism in accordance with\nparagraph 16 or filed in another forum prior to the effective date of this agreement, the Commission\nshall be the sole forum for adjudicating claims described in paragraph 1 or filed under paragraph 9\nof this Article, and any such claims which could have been and were not submitted by that deadline\nshall be extinguished, in accordance with international law.\n;\nAnd in the alternative:\n3. Indicate the relevance or otherwise of Article 56 (7); and\n4. Whether a final decision on the merits at this stage will have an impact and what effect, if any, that\nwould have on the peace process between the two countries.\n18. On 18th June 2001 both parties were informed of the African Commission's decision and were invited to\nforward their submissions on the above-mentioned questions.\n19. At its 30th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, the African Commission heard oral\nsubmissions from all the parties and decided as follows :• the Governments of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the State of Eritrea should\nsubmit claims relating to the abovementioned communication to the Claims Commission;\n• that any correspondence relating to communication 233/99 and 234/99 made to the Claims\nCommission should be copied and forwarded to the African Commission;\n• to postpone further consideration on the merits of communication 233/99 and 234/99 to the 31st\nOrdinary Session to ascertain whether matters covered by the communication are also covered by\nand have been submitted to the Claims Commission.\n20. On 24th October 2001 the parties were informed of the decision of the African Commission.\n\n2\n\n\f21. During the 31st Ordinary Session of the African Commission, Eritrea submitted a letter from the\nPresident of the Claims Commission. In that letter the President of the Claims Commission states to the\neffect that, Eritrea and Ethiopia can provide the African Commission with copies of their statements of claim\nor other appropriate information relating to the Claims Commission if required by the African Commission.\n22. At its 31st Ordinary Session, the African Commission heard oral submissions from all the parties to the\ncommunication and decided to defer consideration of the matter to the 32nd Session in order to allow the\nComplainants time to forward their written responses to the written submissions of Ethiopia.\n23. On 7th June 2002, all the parties to the above-mentioned communication were informed of the African\nCommission's decision. INTERIGHTS was requested to forward its written response to the Secretariat of\nthe African Commission within 2 months from the date of notification.\n24. On 30th July 2002, INTERIGHTS was reminded that the Secretariat was awaiting to receive their written\nsubmissions on or before the 7th August 2002. There has been no response from INTERIGHTS thus far.\n25. At its 32nd Ordinary Session, the African Commission heard oral submissions from the State of Eritrea\nand decided to defer consideration of this communication to the 33rd Ordinary Session. Parties to the\ncommunication were informed accordingly.\n26. At its 33rd Ordinary Session, held from 15th to 29th May 2003, in Niamey, Niger, the African Commission\ndecided to suspend consideration of these communications sine die.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\n27. The admissibility of communications brought pursuant to Article 55 of the Charter is governed by the\nconditions stipulated in Article 56 of the Charter. This Article lays down seven (7) conditions, which\ngenerally must be fulfilled by a Complainant for a communication to be declared admissible.\n28. Of the seven conditions, the government of Ethiopia claims that the Complainants have not fulfilled\nthree; namely Article 56 (1), (5) and (7). Additionally, it questions the neutrality, credibility and integrity of\nthe NGOs submitting the communication.\n29. The State of Eritrea on its part claims that the Complainants have not fulfilled two conditions, namely\nArticles 56 (6) and (7).\n30. Article 56 (1) of the African Charter stipulates: \"Communications relating to human and peoples' rights\nreferred to in Article 55..... shall be considered if they: (1) Indicate their authors even if the latter request\nanonymity.\"\n31. The government of Ethiopia submits that the Complainants being NGOs are expected to provide the\nnames of their representatives, and since they failed to do so in their letter of August 1999 the African\nCommission should reject the communication.\n32. Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia questions the neutrality, credibility and integrity of the NGOs\nsubmitting the communications. This, the government alleges, is evidenced by the superficial treatment\ngiven by the Complainant NGOs to the plight of thousands of Ethiopians suffering in the hands of the\nEritrean government whereas with respect to Eritrea, they submitted a detailed verbatim report. Ethiopia\nthus claims that the submission on Ethiopia is only an attempt by the Complainant to give it a semblance of\ncredibility.\n33. The African Commission is of the view that in terms of Article 56 (1) of the African Charter, it is enough\nif the said complaint bears, as in this case, the name of one of the organisation's representatives. Thus the\npresent complaint cannot be declared inadmissible on the basis of Article 56 (1).\n34. With respect to the question of the neutrality, credibility and integrity of the NGOs submitting the\ncommunication, the African Commission does not consider this issue as one that falls within the\nrequirement for the admissibility of the communication as stipulated under Article 56 of the Charter. In any\ncase, the evidence before the African Commission does not lead it to uphold the submission of the\ngovernment of Ethiopia on the credibility, neutrality and integrity of the NGOs particularly INTERIGHTS\nwhich effectively became the Complainant.\n35. Article 56 (5) of the African Charter stipulates: \"Communications relating to human and peoples rights\nreferred to in Article 55..... shall be considered if they: (5) Are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any\nunless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged\".\n36. Regarding the issue of exhaustion of local remedies, the government of Ethiopia submits that the\nComplainants have not availed themselves of the remedies available at the local courts before approaching\n3\n\n\fthe African Commission.\n37. The Complainant asserts, and the African Commission is of the opinion that there were no domestic\nremedies available to the Complainants, as a practical matter in this case. In coming to this decision the\nAfrican Commission relies on its decision on the issue in communication 71/92 Rencontre africaine pour la\ndéfense des Droits de l'Homme/Zambia, a case that involved mass deportation and transfer of multiple\nvictims. In this case the African Commission observed: \"The mass nature of the arrests, the fact that victims\nwere kept in detention prior to their expulsion, and the speed with which the expulsions were carried out\ngave the Complainants no opportunity to establish the legality of these actions in the courts. For\nComplainants to contact their families, much less attorneys was not possible. Thus the recourse referred to\nby the government ... was, as a practical matter, not available to the Complainants.\"\n38. The government of Eritrea alleges that the Complainant has not fulfilled the conditions stipulated under\nArticle 56 (6) of the African Charter. Article 56 (6) of the African Charter reads: \"Communications relating to\nhuman and peoples' rights referred to in Article 55..... shall be considered if they: (6) are submitted within a\nreasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted or from the time local remedies are\nexhausted or from the date the commission is seized with the matter.\"\n39. The African Commission is of the view that bearing in mind its decision in relation to Article 56 (5)\ncompliance with the provisions of Article 56 (6) of the African Charter by the Complainant is rendered\ninapplicable.\n40. Both the governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia also raise an objection to the African Commission\nadmitting the communications stating that the Complainants did not comply with the provisions of Article 56\n(7) of the African Charter.\n41. At its 27th Ordinary Session held in Algeria, after hearing the representatives of the parties on the\nadmissibility of the case, the African Commission decided to declare both communications admissible.\n42. It is to be recalled that at its 29th Ordinary Session held in Libya, the African Commission heard oral\nsubmissions from all the parties and decided to consolidate Communications 233/99 and 234/99. The\nAfrican Commission also postponed further consideration on the merits of the case to the 30th Ordinary\nSession and invited parties to the communication 233/99 and 234/99 to submit arguments for the purpose\nof clarifications in terms of Rule 104 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\nClarifications Sought by the African Commission in Terms of Rule 104 of the Rules of Procedure\n\nThe desirability or otherwise of considering the communications under Articles 47 - 54 of the\nAfrican Charter\n43. The Respondent States argue that it is undesirable that the communications before the African\nCommission be converted into State-to-State proceedings. The government of Ethiopia takes this position\nbecause the two countries, Ethiopia and Eritrea have already negotiated and signed a Peace Agreement\nwith regard to the conflict that gave rise to the human rights violations that were committed by the\nrespective States. Therefore the African Commission should discontinue considering the complaints before\nit and let the Ethio-Eritrean Claims Commission handle the matters raised within the complaints.\n44. The communications presently before the African Commission are governed by Articles 55 - 57 of the\nCharter, a category of cases clearly distinct from complaints governed by Articles 47 - 54 of the Charter.\nThe provisions of the African Charter and the Rules of Procedure do not provide for any procedure to\nconvert non-State communications into inter-state communications. The initiation of an inter-state complaint\nis dependent on the voluntary exercise of the sovereign will of a State party to the Charter, which decision\ncan only be made by States in accordance with the Charter. From the submissions of the Respondent\nStates, the African Commission comes to the conclusion that Ethiopia and Eritrea do not wish to initiate an\ninter-state complaint before the African Commission; furthermore they believe that the complaint against\nthem that is before the African Commission should be dismissed as they believe that the Ethio-Eritrean\nClaims Commission would be better suited to handle the matters raised in those complaints. The African\nCommission cannot and will therefore not consider the communication under Articles 47 - 54, a procedure\nrelating to the consideration of inter-state communications.\nThe extent to which matters covered by the complaints are the subject of the Peace Agreement\n4\n\n\fbetween the Governments [of] Ethiopia and Eritrea signed on 12th December 2000, including the\nmechanism for the consideration of claims by individuals in either State whose citizenship may be\nin dispute (Article 5 (8)\n× Claims shall be submitted to the Commission by each of the parties on its own behalf and on behalf of its\nnationals, including both natural and juridical persons.

As part of their submissions on the clarification sought by the African Commission, the government of\nEthiopia forwarded documents relating to the Claims Commission's hearings that were held from 1st to 2nd\nJuly 2001. During the hearings, the Claims Commission addressed itself to the nature of the claims that the\ngovernments of Ethiopia and Eritrea will place before it. The Claims Commission was of the view that its\njurisdiction under Article 5 (1)\n× Article 5\n1. Consistent with the Framework Agreement, in which the parties commit themselves to addressing the\nnegative socio-economic impact of the crisis on the civilian population, including the impact on those\npersons who have been deported, a neutral Claims Commission shall be established. The mandate of the\nCommission is to decide through binding arbitration all claims for loss, damage or injury by one\nGovernment against the other, and by nationals (including both natural and juridical persons) of one party\nagainst the Government of the other party or entities owned or controlled by the other party that are\n\n(a) related to the conflict that was the subject of the Framework Agreement, the Modalities for its\nImplementation and the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, and\n\n(b) result from violations of international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, or\nother violations of international law. The Commission shall not hear claims arising from the cost of military\noperations, preparing for military operations, or the use of force, except to the extent that such claims\ninvolve violations of international humanitarian law.\nincludes two basic types of claims. The Parties may file traditional Inter-State claims under the principles of\nthe law of State Responsibility for injury to the Claimant State. These may include claims for injuries to the\nState occurring by reason of injuries to its nationals in violation of international law.\nOr, the Parties may choose to file the claims of individual nationals that fall within the scope of Article 5(1).\nThe Claims Commission is open to either approach, or to a combination of them, so long as no duplicate\ncompensation for the same injury results.\n49. At the 31st Session of the African Commission, both the Respondent States asserted that they had filed\nwith the Claims Commission, all the matters covered by communication 233/99 and 234/99.\n50. The government of Eritrea contended that it made claims for violations of the rights of Eritrean citizens\nand/or Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean ethnic origin and that these claims also constitute allegations of\nviolations of the African Charter and of international law (Statements of Claims Nos. 15, 16, 17, 19 and 21).\nThe claims include the internment without trial of civilians because of their membership in political\norganisations or for reasons of their ethnicity or national origin. The government of Eritrea stated that it\nmade claims on behalf of persons of Eritrean citizenship and/or Eritrean national origin for:\n• The illegal internment of civilians in concentration camps without formal accusation or trial;\n• The physical maltreatment and torture of such individuals;\n\n6\n\n\f• The discriminatory dismissals from employment, evictions from rental property, and seizure of\nproperty from persons of Eritrean national origin who are still present in Ethiopia.\n51. The government of Ethiopia also argues that the allegations presented in this communication have\nbeen submitted to the Claims Commission. They state that in their Statement of Claim No. 5 that they\nsubmitted before the Claims Commission, they made claims for the unlawful treatment of Ethiopian\nnationals living in Eritrea, including arbitrary detention, mass internment, torture, abuse, murder, forced\ndisappearances, forced conscription into the military, confiscation of property and systematic rape of\nEthiopian women. The Statement of Claim also includes factual representations relating to the Eritrean\ngovernment's policy of discrimination against Ethiopians in Eritrea, including arbitrary dismissal of Ethiopian\nnationals from public and private employment in Eritrea; Eritrea's unlawful restrictions on the freedom of\nmovement, including exit from Eritrea and forceful expulsion of Ethiopians and unlawful and inhuman\nconditions during the expulsion of Ethiopian nationals from Eritrea.\nThe Relevance or Otherwise of Article 56 (7) of The African Charter\n\n52. Article 56 (7) of the African Charter provides: \"Communication relating to human and peoples' rights\nreferred to in Article 55 received by the Commission, shall be considered if they: (7) do not deal with cases\nwhich have been settled by these States involved in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the\n[UN], or the Charter of the [OAU] or the provisions of the present Charter.\"\n53. Article 56 (7) of the Charter precludes the African Commission from considering cases that have been\nsettled by States in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the UN, or the Charter of the OAU or\nthe provisions of the present Charter.\n54. The Complainant refers the African Commission to its decision in communication 59/91 Emgba\nMekongo Louis/Cameroon, where it held that mediation by political institutions such as the European Union\nwas irrelevant to Article 56 (7) of the Charter. INTERIGHTS thus submits that this holding applies with\nequal force to the political organs of the OAU.\n55. The Claims Commission created by a Peace Agreement should not be viewed as a political organ of\nthe OAU; rather it is a body that has been established under a Peace Agreement and which, under Article 5\n(13)\n× Article 5\n13. In considering claims, the Commission shall apply relevant rules of international law. The Commission\nshall not have the power to make decisions ex aequo et bono.\n, is bound to apply rules of international law and cannot make decisions ex aequo et bono. Indeed the\nClaims Commission has ruled that in dealing with evidence, they must apply evidentiary rules that prove or\ndisprove disputed facts (see decision number 4 of the Claims Commission). The Claims Commission\ntherefore has the capacity, unlike the African Commission to deal with complex matters such as the\ncitizenship status of the individuals, what amount of compensation shall be awarded and to whom, in\nrespect of the violations that they have suffered. Such was the complexity that the African Commission was\nfaced with in Emgba Mekongo Louis/Cameroon (supra) where it found a violation of Mekongo's rights but\nstated \"that it was unable to determine their amount and the quantum should be determined under the law\nof Cameroon\".\n56. In communication 60/91 Constitutional Rights Project/Nigeria, the African Commission held that it would\nnot rely on the process or mechanism of a \"discretionary, extra-ordinary ... non-judicial nature\" or that \"have\nno obligation to decide according to legal principles\" to preclude the admissibility of a communication under\nArticle 56(7) of the African Charter. The African Commission would say that this is clearly not the case with\nregard to the Claims Commission as has been demonstrated by Article 5(13) of the Peace Agreement that\nprovides that it is bound to apply rules of international law and cannot make decisions ex aequo et bono.\nThis therefore puts the Claims Commission under those bodies envisaged under Article 56 (7).\n57. From the submissions of the Respondent States, it seems to the African Commission, that the matters\nbrought before it, are matters that have been placed before the Claims Commission which can therefore\nadequately deal with such matters.\n58. At the 31st Ordinary Session, the Complainants requested the African Commission to defer\nconsideration of these communications to the 32nd Ordinary Session to enable them submit written\nresponses to the Respondent States' submissions. The African Commission granted the request and\n7\n\n\finformed the parties accordingly. The Secretariat of the African Commission has written to the\nComplainants asking them to forward the stated written responses but there has been no reaction from\nthem.\n59. In principle the appropriate remedy of those claims submitted to the Claims Commission should be\nmonetary compensation. However, it is also within the Claims Commission's mandate to provide other\ntypes of remedies that are acceptable within international practice. It is probable that the African\nCommission will reach a decision finding the Respondent States in violation of the rights of the individuals\non whose behalf INTERIGHTS is acting. However, as was the case in Emgba Mekongo Louis/Cameroon\n(supra), the African Commission would certainly be constrained in awarding compensation and may have\nto refer this matter to the Claims Commission and at which point the matter would certainly be time barred.\n60. While the African Commission would have opted to proceed and deal with the instant communications,\nthe Respondent States Parties have assured the African Commission that all the issues before the African\nCommission will be brought before the Claims Commission.\n\nHolding\n\nFor these reasons, the African Commission decides as follows:\n• to suspend consideration of communication 233/99 and 234/99 sine die, and await the decision of\nthe Claims Commission with regard to matters contained in this communication;\n• that the Respondent States keep the African Commission regularly informed of the process before\nthe Claims Commission with particular reference to the matters contained in these communications;\n• the Republic of Ethiopia and the State of Eritrea are requested to transmit a copy of the text of the\ndecision of the Claims Commission to the Secretariat of the African Commission as soon as it is\ndelivered;\n• in the event that the Claims Commission does not fully address the human rights violations\ncontained herein, to reopen the matter for consideration;\n• reserves its decision on the merits of these communications.\n\nTaken at the 33rd Ordinary Session in Niamey, Niger May 2003.\n\n8\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"36","date":"","language":"","type_of_document":"","mechanism":"2","keywords":"","activity_report":"","outcome":""}},{"_id":"d09ecfab8d32ed4dd84b0226af0129da","site_name":"Uwazi"},{"_id":"d09ecfab8d32ed4dd84b0226af013131","site_name":"Uwazi"},{"_id":"d09ecfab8d32ed4dd84b0226af0140e8","site_name":"Uwazi"},{"_id":"d09ecfab8d32ed4dd84b0226af01438b","site_name":"asdasdas"},{"_id":"d09ecfab8d32ed4dd84b0226af014d20","site_name":"Uwazi"},{"_id":"d09ecfab8d32ed4dd84b0226af09d0bb","site_name":"Uwazi","type":"settings"},{"_id":"dbbe73610705d81149f6c600550abc37","name":"Test Entity","properties":[{"label":"Text","type":"text","localID":"t5k5i2bx53k5zksjp2m2kpgb9","name":"text","id":"4992aa3a-293b-4a68-8222-e91eb3c90f32"},{"label":"Select","type":"select","localID":"jmd7nbhdcm2cvjj6wz4qgp66r","content":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a9308071be6","name":"select","id":"83d3ab9b-56d2-4f36-be49-eced925691cf"},{"label":"Date","type":"date","localID":"y9eda38xs73jsauax488bbj4i","name":"date","id":"2fa79c44-9174-46ae-9b4d-28842f5bbca7"}],"isEntity":true,"type":"template"},{"_id":"f04a9a68ddb60fb12e97b4446f01b5d7","site_name":"Master collection"},{"_id":"f2cb1f37c9ac9095ca5f14426305cc01","title":"328 06 Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda v Republic of Angola","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"4-59cf1b25af945b4012dcad00e22ae49a","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1464785175156,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"328_06 Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda v Republic of Angola.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1464785176494x4ibayx1yo7axlxr.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1464785176494x4ibayx1yo7axlxr.pdf","size":89437},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"328/06 Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda\nv Republic of Angola\nSummary of facts:\n1. The Complaint is brought by the Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda - FLEC (the\nComplainant) on behalf of the people of Cabinda (Victims) against the Republic of Angola1 (the\nRespondent State or Angola).\n2. The Complainant submits that Cabinda, formerly known as the Portuguese Congo, consists of a territory\nof approximately 2800 square miles. The Complainant further submits that in 1885 the independent rulers\nof Cabinda city and its environs entered into a treaty, the Treaty of Simulambuco, with the Government of\nthe Kingdom of Portugal establishing a Protectorate over much of present day Cabinda.\n3. In 1975, the Complainant alleges, the Alvor Conference in Portugal, between the colonial power and\nUNITA, MPLA, and FNLA (all of which were liberation movements) declared the annexation of Cabinda by\nAngola without any Cabindan participation. Following this event, Angola has exercised sovereignty over\nCabinda despite protestations by the people of Cabinda, through groups dedicated to the idea of a distinct\nidentity for the people of Cabinda.\n4. The Complainant alleges that since 2002, following attempts by groups in Cabinda to stake a claim to\nautonomy for the people of Cabinda, the Respondent State has undertaken a massive military campaign\nagainst Cabinda and that when this failed, the state entered into ad hoc negotiations with Cabindan factions\nin an attempt to confuse issues. These negotiations, the Complainant alleges, excluded the Chairman of\nFLEC, Mr. Nzita Tiago - \"the only universally recognized Cabindan authority\" - and resulted in a 2006\nPeace Accord that was contested by both Cabinda and the democratic opposition in Angola, the UNITA.\n5. The Complainant further alleges that following the rejection of the 2006 Peace Accord by the majority of\nCabindans, fractions in Cabinda continued to demand local autonomy over the wealth of Cabinda. The\nComplainant states that the Respondent State has responded to the demands by maintaining a large\nmilitary force in Cabinda, which has committed numerous documented human rights violations therein.2\n6. The Complainant claims that in 2006 the Angolan Forces (FAA) committed dozens of human rights and\nhumanitarian violations such as: the bombardment of civilian dwellings in the Mayombe (Piading) region;\nsummary execution of Cabinda patriots in Buco, Zao and beatings and torture of Mpalabanda members in\nCaio Poba.\n7. It is the Complainant further claim that in July 2006 Angola banned the only independent human rights\norganization in Cabinda, Mpalabnda (Associacao Civica de Cabinda) through the instrumentality of a court\norder, allegedly for inciting violence and hatred, and carrying out political activities rather than being a civil\nsociety organization.\n8. Furthermore, the Complainant avers, Government of the Respondent State is exercising economic\nexploitation of Cabindan resources since the people of Cabinda are not allowed to have any say in the\ngrant of licences and concessions over their resources. The Complainant claims that the people of Cabinda\nhave been suffering comparatively higher unemployment, lack of educational opportunities, disease and\nintense poverty since the Government of the Respondent State took over Cabinda's natural resources such\nas offshore oil, onshore mineral and oil resources.\n9. The Complainant further alleges that the Government of the Respondent State has economically\ndominated the Cabindan people by denying them their status as a people and by extracting more than\nninety per cent (90%) of their economic patrimony while returning less than ten per cent (10%) to Cabinda.\nBy this act, the Complainant alleges, the Respondent State has perpetrated neo-colonialism.\n10. The Complainant also contends that although Cabindans are culturally and linguistically separate from\nAngola and have overwhelmingly identified themselves as 'Cabindans', not Angolans, the people of\nCabinda have been denied their right to self-determination by Angola.\n11. The Complainant submits that despite over 30 years of conflict over the status of Cabinda, the\nRespondent State has refused to hold a referendum on the issue of Cabindan question. The Complainant\nalleges that the Respondent State does not permit Cabinda to determine its own economic and social\ndevelopment. The Complainant states that all economic decisions are made in Luanda, the capital city of\nthe Respondent State and not in Cabinda, even though Cabinda has maintained a government in exile\nsince 1963 and has had an active self-defence force and civil administration inside Cabinda since 1975.\n1\n\n\fArticles alleged to have been violated\n12. The Complainant alleges that in relation to the people of Cabinda, the Respondent State has violated\nArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter.\nPrayers of the Complainant\n13. The Complainant requests the African Commission on Human and Peoples Right (African Commission\nor Commission):\n1. To appoint a Special Rapporteur to undertake fact finding and make recommendations on the\nissues it has raised.\n2. Make its good offices available for further engagement on the issues raised\n3. Award $US 50000 against the Respondent State to cover the Complainant's legal fees and costs.\n\nProcedure\n14. This Communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on Human and\nPeoples' Rights (the Secretariat) on 29 September 2006. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt by letter\ndated 2 October 2006, informing the Complainant that the Communication would be scheduled for\nconsideration on seizure by the African Commission at its 40th Ordinary Session held in November 2006 in\nBanjul, The Gambia.\n15. At its 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission decided to be seized of the Communication.\n16. On 8 January 2007, the African Commission further received a press statement issued by FLEC on the\ncurrent struggle for the control of petroleum in Cabinda, alleging continuous violations of the African\nCharter by the Angolan Government and other actors for which the State is responsible.\n17. By a letter dated 8 February 2007 and Note Verbale dated 28 February 2007, the Secretariat informed\nthe Parties of the Commission's decision on seizure and requested the Parties to submit their arguments on\nthe Admissibility of the Communication within two months. A copy of the Complaint was also transmitted to\nthe Respondent State.\n18. On 25 April 2007, the Secretariat sent reminders to the Parties to submit their arguments on\nAdmissibility by 10 May 2007 in time for the 41st Session of the African Commission. At its 41st Ordinary\nSession in May 2007 in Accra, Ghana, the Commission considered the Communication and deferred it\npending the receipt of Arguments on Admissibility from the Parties. The Parties were notified accordingly\non 20 June 2007.\n19. On 15 August 2007, the Complainant's brief with its Arguments on Admissibility and an updated\nstatement of facts was received at the Secretariat. These were transmitted along with a Note Verbale to the\nRespondent State on 20 August 2007 together with a request for the latter to submit its response to the\nComplainant's submission on Admissibility.\n20. During its 42nd Ordinary Session in November 2007, the African Commission considered the\nCommunication and decided to give the Respondent State one last chance to make its submissions on the\nAdmissibility of the Communication. The Parties were notified accordingly on 19 December 2007.\n21. During its 43rd and 44th Ordinary Sessions, the African Commission deferred the consideration of the\nCommunication pending the submission on Admissibility by the Respondent State, the parties were\naccordingly informed.\n22. On 27 April 2009 the Secretariat sent a reminder to the Respondent State to make its submissions on\nAdmissibility.\n23. On 21 July 2009, the African Commission received supplementary information to the Communication by\nthe Complainant.\n24. During its 45th and 46th Ordinary Sessions respectively, the African Commission considered the\nCommunication and deferred its decision on Admissibility pending the Respondent State's submission on\nAdmissibility\n2\n\n\f25. On 12 January 2010, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant urging the African\nCommission to take immediate action and to appoint a Special Rapporteur for Cabinda.\n26. During its 47th, 48th, 49th and 50th Ordinary Sessions, the African Commission deferred the\nconsideration of the Communication, and the Parties were accordingly informed. At its 10th Extraordinary\nSession held in December 2011, the Commission considered the Communication and declared it\nAdmissible. The Parties were accordingly informed and invited to submit their Arguments on the Merit.\n27. Between January and March 2012, the Secretariat received submissions from three different\norganisations representing different groups in Cabinda (joint submission by the Front de Liberation de\nL'Etat du Cabinda (FLEC) et Union Nationale de Liberation du Cabinda (UNLC), and individual submissions\nby the \"Original FLEC\" and the Mouvement Pour Le Rassemblement Du Peuple Cabindais et Pour Sa\nSouverainete \"MRPCS). On 29 March 2012, the Secretariat received a Submission on the Merit from Dr\nJonathan Levy acting in his capacity as legal representative of the Complainant.3 The Complainant's\nSubmission on the Merit was accordingly transmitted to the Respondent State.\n28. On 24 April 2012, the Respondent State's Note Verbale forwarding the latter's Arguments on the Merit\nwas received at the Secretariat and transmitted to Complainant through its legal representative.\n29. On 12 July 2012, the Complainant through its legal representative forwarded its Supplementary\nSubmission on the Merit. On 10, 12 and 28 September 2012, the Secretariat received the same copy of an\nupdated and amended Submission on the Merit from the Respondent State.\n30. On 18 June 2013, the Secretariat received additional Submissions from the \"Collectif des organisations\ncabindaises\" also known as the \"Original FLEC\". This submission was followed by a letter protesting\nnotification that the submission has been made out of time and a request for reopening of the procedure for\nsubmission of additional documents by both parties.\n31. At its 54th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia in October 2013, the Commission considered\nthe Communication on the Merit based on all the documents submitted by the Parties and the various\nAmicus briefs.\n\nThe Law\nAdmissibility\nSubmission of the Complainant on Admissibility\n\n32. Although the Complainant submitted its written arguments on the admissibility of the Communication,\nthe Respondent State failed to submit any arguments on the admissibility of the Communication despite an\ninvitation and repeated reminders to do so. Accordingly, the Commission addresses the question of\nAdmissibility on the basis of the Complainant's arguments on Admissibility.\n33. The Complainant submits that the Communication meets all the Admissibility requirements set out in\nArticle 56 of the African Charter. Regarding Article 56 (1) of the African Charter, the Complainant avers that\nthe Communication is submitted by FLEC on behalf of the people of Cabinda.\n34. Concerning Article 56 (2) of Charter, the Complainant submits that the Respondent State has violated\nArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter. The Complainant further submits that although the\nCommunication alleges serious violations of the economic and peoples\" rights of the people of Cabinda by\nthe Government of Angola, the Complainant does not request the African Commission to take up any\nmatter that would interfere with the sovereignty of Angola or adjudication of Angolan territorial claims in\nCabinda. The Complainant states that they are mindful that the African Commission must respect Articles\n3(b) and 4(b) of the AU Constitutive Act regarding territorial sovereignty and respecting existing borders.\n35. With regards to Article 56 (3) of the African Charter, the Complainant avers that the language used in\nthe Communication is neutral legal language. In relation to Article 56 (4) of the African Charter, the\nComplainant submits that the Communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated through the\nmass media, but rather on primary information provided by FLEC and other organizations directly involved\nin the matter.\n36. On the requirement of the exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56 (5) of the African Charter, the\nComplainant requests the Commission to wave this condition on the basis that exhaustion of domestic\nremedies is futile and legally impossible on the grounds that there is unrest and armed conflict involving the\nParties and this creates difficulties for the commencement of legal proceedings by the Complainant. The\nComplainant avers further that the only independent civil society organisation which could have brought a\n3\n\n\flegal action on behalf of the Complainant has been disbanded and banned by judicial order instigated by\nthe Respondent State. It is also the Complainant's submission that it cannot pursue legal action in the\nRespondent State because it (the Complainant) has been branded a terrorist organisation since the signing\nof a 2006 Peace Accord between the Respondent States and elements in Cabinda.\n37. As to Article 56 (6) of the African Charter, the Complainants aver that the Communication has been\nsubmitted in a timely manner. Lastly, the Complainant submits that the Communication complies with the\nrequirement of Article 56 (7) of the African Charter because the Communication does not deal with a case\nwhich has been settled by the Respondent State.\nThe Commission's Analysis on Admissibility\n\n38. Article 56 of the African Charter lists seven Admissibility requirements that have to be cumulatively\nfulfilled for a Communication to be declared Admissible. In the present Communication, while the\nComplainant has clearly stated its arguments as to why the Communication meets each of the seven\nrequirements stipulated under Article 56, the Respondent State has not made any submission to contest or\nrefute those claims.\n39. From the time when the African Commission was seized with the Communication during its 40th\nOrdinary Session in November 2006 to date, ten (10) reminders were sent to the Respondent State\nrequesting the latter to submit its arguments on Admissibility to no avail.4\n40. As the African Commission has stated in the case of the Institute for Human Rights and Development in\nAfrica v. Republic of Angola5 \"in the face of the state's failure to address itself to the complaint filed against\nit, the African Commission has no option but to proceed with its consideration of the Communication in\naccordance with its Rules of Procedure.\" In the same decision, the African Commission re-affirmed its\nposition by ruling that \"... it would proceed to consider Communications on the basis of the submission of\nthe Complainants and information at its disposal, even if the State fails to submit.\"6\n41. In the case at hand, the Complainant submits that the Communication complies with all the seven\nrequirements of Article 56 of the African Charter, except the one relating to the exhaustion of local\nremedies under Article 56 (5), for which the Complainant asks for waiver.\n42. In the absence of any submissions from the Respondent State to the contrary, the African Commission\nhas considered the Complainant's Submission and is convinced that all the requirements under Article 56,\nexcept Article 56(5) are met. The Commission proceeds to consider the legitimacy of the request for waiver\nbased on Article 56(5) of the Charter and relevant jurisprudence.\n43. Article 56(5) of the African Charter provides that Communications should be \"sent after exhausting local\nremedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged\". This requirement is based on\nthe principle that \"the respondent state must first have an opportunity to redress by its own means within\nthe framework of its own domestic legal system, the wrong alleged to have been done to the individual\".7\n44. The Commission has stressed that the requirement of the exhaustion of local remedies \"does not mean\nthat complainants are required to exhaust any local remedy which is found to be, as a practical matter,\nunavailable or ineffective.\"8 The jurisprudence of the Commission, in determining compliance with this\nrequirement, sets out \"[t]hree major criteria, that is: the local remedy must be available, effective and\nsufficient.\"9\n45. The initial burden is on the Complainant to prove that they have met the requirement set in Article 56\n(5) or that those remedies are unavailable in the particular case. Thereafter, the burden shifts to the\nRespondent State if it contests the allegations of the former.\n46. In the present case, the Complainant avers that it has no legal standing under Angolan law and its\nrepresentatives would face arrest and possible execution under Angolan national security laws if they try to\npursue legal remedies in Angola, adding that members of FLEC are considered terrorists in Angolan\nterritory and hence any attempt to take the case before Angolan courts would be futile, if not impossible,\nand would subject members of the Complainant organisation to arbitrary arrest, detention or execution as\nterrorists.\n47. The Complainant also submits that the only independent human rights organisation in Cabinda,\nMpalabanda, that could have taken their case before a court of law was banned on 20 July 2006 for\nallegedly inciting violence and hatred, and being involved in political activities. Furthermore, the\nComplainant argues that the principal members of FLEC (the Complainant) are outside Angolan\njurisdiction, thus they request for the waiver of the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies.\n48. These claims, which are not contested by the Respondent State, show the apparent existence of fear of\n4\n\n\fpersecution on the part of the Complainant.\n49. In a number of cases the African Commission has used the standard of constructive exhaustion of local\nremedies to provide an exception to the rule. Fear of persecution is one of the exceptions to the\nrequirement of exhaustion of local remedies. In Sir Dawda K Jawara v The Gambia10 the African\nCommission reasoned that \"the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but\nalso in practice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Therefore, if the\napplicant cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of generalised fear for his life (or even those of\nhis relatives), local remedies would be considered to be unavailable to him\".\n50. In Rights International v Nigeria11 and John D Ouoko v Kenya12 , the African Commission reasoned that\nthe existence of apparent fear of persecution on the part of the victims, to return to their countries to\nexhaust local remedies would make the remedies not available to such persons and hence exempt them\nfrom the requirement to exhaust those remedies.\n51. In the present Communication, the fact that the Complainant has no legal standing before Angolan\ncourts, that most of its members live abroad and are considered terrorists by the Government, leads to the\nconclusion that the chances of the Complainant exhausting local remedies have been practically rendered\nimpossible by fear of prosecution.\n52. Therefore, the African Commission holds that local remedies were not available to the Complainant and\nhence rules that the Communication is in line with the requirement under Article 56(5) of the African\nCharter.\n53. For the above reasons, the African Commission declares the Communication admissible in accordance\nwith Article 56 of the African Charter.\nConsideration of the Merits\nSummary of Complaint's Submission\n\n54. The Complainant emphasises that the present Communication concerns itself strictly with a claim for\neconomic self-determination of the people of Cabinda and in particular with the disposition and exploitation\nof onshore oil, mineral and natural resources.\n55. The Complainant states further that the Communication excludes the matter of offshore resource\nallocation and relates only to the extraction of onshore resources which has remained dormant due largely\nto FLEC's armed opposition to any such exploitation. The Complainant contends that it does not recognise\ngrants of resource extraction licences and concessions made by the Respondent State and asserts that it\nreserves the right to make its own arrangements with resource extraction companies upon the\n\"decolonisation\" of Cabinda.\n56. Based on its contention that it has been recognised as the legitimate representative of the Cabinda\npeople since 1974, the Complainant requests that the Commission to appoint a Special Rapporteur on the\nissue of Cabinda's economic self-determination on the grounds that the Respondent State has violated\nArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter.\n57. The Complainant argues that as an incident of the right to property under Article 14 of the African\nCharter, the natural resources of Cabinda remain the property of the people of Cabinda and must be\nadministered largely for the benefit of the people of Cabinda. Accordingly, the grant of licences and\nconcession for the extraction of onshore natural resources by the Respondent State is a violation of Article\n14 of the African Charter.\n58. It is the further contention of the Complainant that although a state can grant resource extraction rights\nin the name of its people, a grant made in cases where one people dominate another or a grant made or\nadministered in an irresponsible manner would be illegitimate. The Complainant argues that historically,\nCabinda has always maintained a separate identity, linguistically and otherwise, and the people of Cabinda\nwere neither consulted on the 'unilateral termination of Portuguese colonial protectorate' nor did they ratify\n'the Angolan occupation' of Cabinda.\n59. The Complainant states that since 1974 it has 'maintained a civil government inside portions of\nCabinda' and many of the areas of resource extraction 'are in or near the FLEC zone'. Further, that since\nthe people of Cabinda are distinct, the Respondent State is not entitled to unilaterally grant resource\nextraction licences or concessions in violation of the right to property of the people of Cabinda as contained\nin Article 14 of the African Charter.\n60. In relation to the alleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter, the Complainant contends that\n5\n\n\f'revenue from onshore resource extraction will flow to Luanda just as offshore revenue does now'. The\nComplainant argues that a 2006 Cabinda Peace Accord which promised a 50% return of oil revenue to\nCabinda 'has not been realised or audited' and only '10% or less will return to Cabinda'. The Complainant\nalleges further that any attempt to question the allocation of revenue has resulted in summary\nimprisonment 'as in the case of Global Witness Investigatory' staff who was arrested and charged by\nAngolan Police after meeting with local representatives of civil society in Cabinda.\n61. The Complainant alleges further that in spite of the abundant oil resources in Cabinda unemployment is\nhigh and poverty, infant mortality and disease are higher in Cabinda than in most areas of Angola. The\nComplainant adds that Cabinda's resources have 'subsidised the government of Angola' and the 'Angolan\nadministration has little concern for providing public goods and incentives to facilitate investment in welfare\nenhancing improvements for the population at large'. Thus, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent\nState has violated Article 19 of the African Charter.\n62. Regarding the alleged violation of Article 20 of the Charter, the Complainant emphasises that the\npeople of Cabinda are geographically, politically, linguistically and culturally distinct from Angolans so that\nthey are have a right to social and economic development. The Complainant contends that the people of\nCabinda are unable to exercise this right because organisations which 'espouse a uniquely Cabindan point\nof view' have been banned by the government of Angola. Complainant alleges further that Cabindans who\ncampaign for economic self-determination are routinely arrested as 'FLEC sympathisers' while foreigners\nwho have identified corruption in Cabinda have been sent to jail. Accordingly the Complainant claims that\nthe Respondent State has violated Article 20 of the African Charter.\n63. On Article 21 of the African Charter, the Complainant contends that grants and concessions (what it\nterms onshore oil and mineral rights offerings) have been made by the Respondent State 'without input\nfrom the Cabindans' and that all decisions regarding natural resources are made from Luanda, the Capital\nof Angola. The Complainant contends that the Cabinda people and FLEC as the representative of the\nCabinda people have not been adequately consulted about the management of 'their onshore resources.\nRather, exploration and exploitation activities have been undertaken under the watch of the Angolan Armed\nForces. Thus, the Complainant disputes the legal right of the Respondent State to exploit and dispose\nonshore resources in Cabinda and alleges that such activities amount to spoliation which is in violation of\nArticle 21 of the African Charter and therefore should be redressed by the Respondent State.\n64. On the alleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter, the Complainant asserts that the people of\nCabinda are a distinct people with a right to economic and social development and contends that the\ncurrent policy of the Respondent State is one of 'Angolanisation of Cabinda' involving discriminating against\nand arresting individuals and groups that claim a Cabindan identity. Accordingly, the Complainant alleges\nthat the Respondent State has violated Article 22 of the African Charter.\n65. Regarding Article 24 of the African Charter, the Complainant alleges that the environment in Cabinda is\nnot conducive for the development of the people of Cabinda. While it claims it does not seek an ideal\nenvironment, the Complainant argues that it seeks an environment that permits 'some measure of equity for\nthe people of Cabinda'. The Complainant contends that the operations of companies such as Chevron take\nplace in conditions that harm human health and the environment because the Respondent State has failed\nto enforce compliance with environmental rules.\n66. The Complainant alleges further that the absence of viable civil society in Cabinda following the ban on\nthe Mpalabanda organisation ensures that the activities of oil companies are not monitored and no\ncompensation is paid in the event of damage to the environment. The Complainant therefore argues that\nthe Respondent State has violated the right of the people of Cabinda to a satisfactory environment as\nguaranteed in Article 24 of the African Charter.\n67. In support of all its allegations, the Complaint has submitted five documents as exhibits. They include a\n\"Republic of Kabinda January 8 2010 Committee Report on the Togolese Incident\"; a 1974 joint\ncommuniqué between Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola MPLA) and the Complainant (FLEC);\na Human Rights Watch report titled \"They Put me in the Hole - Military Detention, Torture and Lack of Due\nProcess in Cabinda\"; a 2008 Chevron Alternative Annual Report titled \"Chevron in Angola\" and an Amnesty\nInternational Public Statement titled \"Angola: Human rights organization banned\". Also submitted in support\nof the Complainant's case are historical accounts presented by different bodies acting on behalf of the\npeoples of Cabinda.\n\n6\n\n\fSummary of Respondent State's Submission\n\n68. In its submission on the merits, the Respondent State argues first that the Communication should not\nhave been declared admissible because that it failed to meet the requirements for admissibility as set out in\nthe African Charter. The Respondent State argues that Article 57 of the African Charter requires that prior\nto the consideration of a Communication on the merit, the Chairperson of the Commission ought to present\nthe Complaint before the Respondent State, setting out procedural matters and indicating whether the\nComplaint conforms to the provisions of the African Charter and other African Union (AU) instruments\nrelevant to the matter. The Respondent State contends that this requirement had not been met with respect\nto the present Communication.\n69. The Respondent State argues further that the Communication is not admissible for failure to comply\nwith the requirements of Articles 50 and 56(5) of the African Charter regarding exhaustion of local\nremedies. The Respondent State also alleges that the Commission failed to comply with Rule 6 (3) of its\nown Rules of Procedure which prohibits \"unrecognised National Liberation Movements from submitting\nmatters for inclusion in the agenda of sessions of the Commission\". The Respondent State insists that the\nComplainant is not qualified to submit this Communication to the African Commission's Session as it is\nneither a State Party nor a party entitled to bring \"Other Communications\" before the Commission.\n70. Citing Articles 3(b)13 and 4(b)14 of the AU Constitutive Act, the Respondent State argues that the\npresent Communication cannot proceed as it challenges the existing borders of an AU Member State and\nthreatens the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Respondent State.\n71. With respect to the merits of the Communication, the Respondent State supplied its version of the\nhistory of Angola emphasising that both the Alvor Accord of 1975 and the Constitution of Angola endow it\nwith sovereignty over the territory now known as Angola, including the Province of Cabinda. The\nRespondent State argues therefore that the right to self-determination has been exercised by the collective\n\"peoples\" of Angola and does not avail minorities and ethnic groups because it can only be available to\nstates emerging from colonial boundaries in recognition of the principle of \"uti possidetis juris\".\n72. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 14 of the African Charter, the Respondent State contends\nthat the right to property is also enshrined in Articles 14 and 37 of its own Constitution. The Respondent\nState argues that the right to property in its Constitution is guaranteed in the interest of individuals,\ncorporate bodies and local communities which \"implies all the people of Angola\"\n73. The Respondent State argues further that the Complainant has not demonstrated that the government\nof Angola does not manage the resources of Cabinda for the benefit of the people of Cabinda. The\nRespondent State avers that the government administers all its natural resources in an equitable and\nbalanced manner as a common asset for the economic, social and cultural development of the country and\nin the national interest.\n74. The Respondent State insists that the government of the Province of Cabinda receives a share of the\nAngolan State General Budget just like every other provincial government in Angola. Further, that by Article\n7 of the Angolan State General Budget Act (no 26/10) the Provinces of Cabinda and Zaire receive amounts\nequal to 10 percent of earnings from petroleum resources in addition to other expenditures and costs for\nthe construction of schools, roads, bridges, harbours, hospitals and other socio-economic infrastructure.\nThus, the Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 14 of the African Charter since its\naffairs are run \"in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws\".\n75. As regards the alleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that\nArticle 21 of its own Constitution provides for the principle of equality and that principle is implemented in all\nits 18 provinces. The Respondent State argues that as a result of its domestic constitutional obligation it\n\"cannot implement measures aimed at developing the country based on the premise that revenue should\nbe spent only in areas where it is generated\". The Respondent State cites the example of its on-going\n\"Strategy to Fight Poverty\" which aims to achieve a \"50% reduction by 2015 in the number of people with\nless than USD1.00 per day\".\n76. The Respondent State insists further that as compared to other provinces, the Province of Cabinda\nenjoys a special status in view of its contribution towards the Angolan State General Budget. The\nRespondent State also asserts that as contained in recent United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) and United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reports, there is an overall improvement\nin areas such as child health care and health care generally. Accordingly, the Respondent State contends,\nit has not violated Article 19 of the African Charter as it relates to the Province of Cabinda.\n77. As regards the alleged violation of Article 20 of the African Charter, the Respondent State contends that\n7\n\n\fthe right has collectively been fulfilled by all the Angolan people through the attainment of independence on\n11 November 1975 and by the conduct of free democratic elections in 1992 and 2008 respectively. The\nRespondent State asserts that according to available records a total of 7, 213, 281 voters representing\n87.36% of the population of Angola went to the polls in the 2008 Legislative elections in Angola. Out of the\n220 deputies elected in the 2008 Legislative elections, 5 came from Cabinda as representatives of the\nCabinda Province. Accordingly, the Respondent State argues that the people of Cabinda are represented\nin the National Assembly of the Republic of Angola by those deputies. In support of these assertions, the\nRespondent State attaches reports of the 2008 and 2012 elections as released by its National Electoral\nCommission.\n78. Accordingly, the Respondent State contends that as with other of its provinces, the Province of Cabinda\nhas its own political and administrative structures which are defined by law. The Respondent State argues\nthat \"like most African peoples, Angola is a multicultural and multilingual society\" and Article 87 of its\nConstitution guarantees the right to respect, appreciation and preservation of the cultural, linguistic and\nartistic identity of the Angolan people. As such, the Respondent State concludes that it has not violated\nArticle 20 of the African Charter.\n79. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 21 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that\nArticles 94 and 95 of its own Constitution create and separate public and private domains of property rights.\nIt asserts that natural resources fall under the public domain and property in the public domain is\nconstitutionally intended to \"serve national interests instead of local interests alone\" since it is expected to\n\"benefit the Angolan people as a whole, with no exception\". The Respondent State points out that the\nComplainant itself agrees that some percentage of oil revenue is already set aside specially for the\nProvince of Cabinda.\n80. The Respondent State contends further that Angola operates a unitary system of government in which\nall provinces are on equal footing such that all public resources should serve the entire population of the\nstate but it was in spite of this fact that the Province of Cabinda has been given special attention as a result\nof its contribution to national oil production.\n81. The Respondent State challenges the Complainant's claim that it (FLEC) is Cabinda's representative\nand argues that the Complainant \"lacks moral, legal and any other form of legitimacy\" therefore it cannot\nspeak on behalf of the people of Cabinda. The Respondent State insists that as a sovereign state, Angola\nhas the legitimacy and the right to explore the natural resources in its territory, including those found in any\nof its 18 provinces. Thus, it argues that it has not violated Article 21 of the African Charter.\n82. In relation to the alleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter, the Respondent State argues that\nthe Complainant has failed to produce any evidence to sustain a claim that the rights of the people of\nCabinda have been violated. The Respondent State asserts that since Cabinda is part of a single,\nindivisible and inalienable territory (Angola) it finds no reason or basis to defend a claim that Cabinda is\nbeing \"Angolanised\".\n83. The Respondent State contends that its citizens are Angolans by origin both according to its domestic\nlaw and in international law. It being the case, that there is no such thing as the State of Cabinda in Africa\nbut a Cabinda that is a province \"which is an integral part of the Angolan State\", the Respondent State\nargues that it retains a right to punish by law, \"every deed, action or attempt to divide the Angolan State\".\nThe Respondent State therefore argues that it has not violated Article 22 of the African Charter.\n84. On the alleged violation of Article 24 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that it takes\nthe characteristics of Cabinda's oil fields and forests into account and has taken measures with a view to\npreserving the environment. The Respondent State cites the enactment of legislation at national and local\nlevels based on an entrenched right to a healthy and unpolluted environment in Article 39 of its\nConstitution. The Respondent State contends further that it has a Basic Environment Act in addition to a\nnumber of other statutes and institutions such as a Multi-Sector Technical Commission and the National\nEnvironment Authority which address the issues arising from oil exploration.\n85. The Respondent State claims further that by a Presidential Decree of 2011, oil companies are required\nto account for any harm stemming from oil spills, while paying greater attention to fishermen and their\nfamilies. The Respondent State admits that there have been oil spills in the Province of Cabinda but that its\nMinistry of Environment's National Environment Surveillance Service has kept track of at least six of these\nspills, compelling oil companies to compensate fishermen and to replace items that had been lost or\ndamaged.\n86. The Respondent State asserts further that it has legislation which compels concessionaires and their\nassociates to take preventive and practical measures to address environmental damage. Such measures\n8\n\n\finclude the generation of evaluation studies and environment impact audits, landscape and structural\nreplenishment plans and standing contract mechanisms for environmental management and auditing.\n87. The Respondent State submits that following an accident in the Gulf of Mexico, its Ministry of\nEnvironment has audited oil rigs in the Angolan sea \"with a view to preventing a repetition of what\nhappened in ... the Western Hemisphere\". It also claims that its Ministry of Environment has \"been holding\npublic consultation on environment impact evaluation in the Cabinda South Block in terms of Decree No\n51\". The Respondent State contends that these measures are not restricted to the oil sector but are\nextended to other resources. Thus, it argues that it has not violated Article 24 of the African Charter.\n88. In proof of its assertion, the Respondent State attached the results of its 2008 and 2012 Legislative\nelections result but no other documents apart from a \"Memorandum of Understanding and Integration of\nFLEC Members\" which states that the Respondent State has spent huge sums of money to register and\ndemobilise former FLEC soldiers. The Respondent State concludes by insisting that the Communication\nshould be considered inadmissible \"for lacking a legal basis and probable cause\".\nComplainant's Supplementary Submission\n\n89. In its supplementary submission in reply to the Respondent State's arguments on the merit, the\nComplainant reaffirmed and expanded on its version of the history of Cabinda in order to show that the\nterritory of Cabinda was historically administered separately from mainland Angola and had a people with\ndistinct linguistic, cultural and political identity.\nAmicus Submissions\n\n90. Between January and March 2012 and again in June 2013, a number of submissions were made by a\nnumber of organisations representing different interests of the Cabinda people. With the consent of the\nlegal representative of the Complainant, those submissions are considered as amicus briefs. In all their\nsubmissions, the different groups advance the Complainant's version of historical facts and insist that the\npeople of Cabinda are victims of unlawful, aggressive and unilateral invasion by the government of the\nRespondent State. The groups submit that as a result of these historical facts and considering that the\npeople of Cabinda were not consulted before their territory was ceded to Angola, the actions of the\nRespondent State amount to colonialism or neo-colonialism such that the people of Cabinda are entitled to\nself-determination.\nThe Commission's Analysis on the Merits\n91. Although it did not submit its observations on the Admissibility of the Communication despite the receipt\nof a formal invitation and reminders to that effect from the Secretariat,15 the first part of the Respondent\nState's submission on the Merit challenges the Admissibility of the Communication and raises issues that\namount to a preliminary objection to the consideration of the Communication. Before analysing the merits of\nthis Communication, the Commission considers it necessary to address some of the concerns raised by the\nRespondent State even though most of those issues ought to have been raised at the admissibility stage.\n92. The Commission notes the Respondent State's argument that Article 57 of the African Charter requires\nthat a Communication to be considered by the Commission should first be presented to the concerned\nState Party by the Chairperson of the African Commission, setting out procedural matters and indicating\nwhether the Communication conforms to the provisions of the African Charter and other AU instruments.\nArticle 57 reads as follows: Prior to any substantive consideration, all communications shall be brought to\nthe knowledge of the State concerned by the Chairman of the Commission\n93. The Commission affirms that Article 57 of the Charter obligates it to notify a State Party of the existence\nof a Complaint against such a State Party so that the State Party can participate in the proceedings. The\nCommission recalls that notice of this Communication was transmitted to the Respondent State by Note\nVerbale dated 28 February 2007. As indicated in paragraphs 16 to 20 and paragraphs 24 to 27 of the\nAdmissibility decision, the Secretariat through several subsequent correspondences transmitted to the\nRespondent State the original Complaint and all other documents filed by the Complainant regarding this\nCommunication. Further, as noted in paragraph 39 above, at least ten (10) reminders were sent to the\nRespondent State to respond to the Admissibility arguments but these did not yield any response from the\nRespondent State. Accordingly, the African Commission notes that it has satisfied its duty to the\nRespondent State as required by Article 57 of the African Charter.\n9\n\n\f94. The Respondent State further contends that the African Commission has failed to comply with Rule\n6(3)16 of its own Rules of Procedure. The Commission notes that the provisions cited by the Respondent\nState relating to the Provisional Agenda of the Commission's sessions are now contained in Rule 32 of the\nCommission's Rules of Procedure. The Commission recalls that Rule 32(2) of its Rules of Procedure\nprovides as follows: The provisional Agenda shall include but not be limited to, items on \"Communications\nfrom States\" and \"Other Communications\" in accordance with the provisions of Articles 48, 49 and 55 of the\nCharter.\n95. The Commission reaffirms that Rule 32(2) of its Rules of Procedure permits \"Other Communications\"17\nsuch as the one now being considered to be included in the Agenda of the Commission's Session. In line\nwith that provision, the present Communication is properly before the Commission as it has duly been\nincluded in the Agenda of the Session.\n96. The Respondent State contends further that the present Communication ought to have been declared\ninadmissible because it fails to comply with certain aspects of Article 56 of the African Charter. The\nCommission recalls that the Respondent State was contacted at every stage and given ample opportunity\nto present its position and arguments regarding the admissibility of this Communication but the Respondent\nState did not take advantage of the opportunity.\n97. The Commission notes further that in the event that a State Party fails to submit its observations on\nadmissibility within 60 days from the receipt of the Complainant's submission from the Secretariat as set out\nin Rule 105(2) of the Commission's Rules of Procedure, this Commission is authorised to proceed to make\na decision on the admissibility of the Communication. In such cases, the Commission examines the\nadmissibility submissions of the Complainant against the provisions of Article 56 of the African Charter. The\nCommission notes that in relation to the present Communication, this procedure has been followed to the\nletter. Accordingly, the Commission cannot revisit its admissibility decision in respect of the\nCommunication.\n98. Notwithstanding the fact that its Admissibility decision in respect of the Communication will not be\nreviewed, the Commission notes the Respondent State's argument that the present Communication should\nhave been declared inadmissible on the grounds that it contradicts Articles 3(b) and 4(b) of the AU\nConstitutive Act. In that regard, the Commission recalls the Complainant's submission that the present\nCommunication does not seek a decision on political self-determination or a right to secede from the\nRespondent State.\n99. In its correspondences and submissions to the Secretariat, the Complainant has maintained that its\nclaim is strictly restricted to a request for a decision on economic self-determination and a determination of\nthe right of the people of Cabinda to enjoy the use of natural resources located within the Province of\nCabinda. The Commission has also considered the prayers of the Complainant and notes that the claims\nas formulated do not contradict the provisions of Articles 3(b) and 4(b) of the AU Constitutive Act. The\nCommission does not consider itself bound to pronounce on the amicus briefs which seek to introduce\nsecessionist dimensions to the Communication. Accordingly, the Commission proceeds to determine the\nCommunication based on the submissions of the Parties.\nAlleged violation of article 14\n\n100. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated the right to property of the people of\nCabinda contrary to Article 14 of the African Charter. Article 14 of the African Charter provides as follows:\nThe right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be encroached upon in the interest of public need or\nin the general interest of the community and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\n101. The Complainant contends that an incident of the right to property as guaranteed in the African\nCharter is that the natural resources of Cabinda must be administered largely for the benefit of the people\nof Cabinda since the people of Cabinda claim a distinct identity from the rest of Angola. It is also the\nComplainant's argument that the Respondent State is not entitled to unilaterally grant resource licences\nand concessions on Cabinda resources.\n102. The Respondent State submits that its Constitution provides for the right to property and that the\nconstitutional right is available to all the peoples of Angola. However, the State argues that certain items\nare classified in its Constitution as property in the public domain intended to serve the wider national\ninterest rather than the interest of a smaller unit within the state. The Respondent State further challenges\nthe Complainant's argument that the Government of Angola has not managed natural resources for the\nbenefit of Cabinda people.\n10\n\n\f103. Generally, this Commission has stated in its jurisprudence that the role of the State in relation to the\nright to property is \"to respect and protect this right against any form of encroachment, and to regulate the\nexercise of this right in order for it to be accessible to everyone.18 One way of fulfilling Charter obligation on\nthe right to property is therefore to adopt legislation which recognises the principle of ownership and\npeaceful enjoyment of property. The inclusion of the right to property in the Angolan Constitution is\ntherefore in compliance with the Respondent State's Charter duty.\n104. With regards to the general question whether a \"people\" can be bearers of the right to property under\nthe African Charter, this Commission has previously answered in the affirmative in relation to indigenous\npeoples in Africa.19 The African Commission reaffirms that a collective or communal right to property exists\nas a component of the right to property in Article 14 of the African Charter. Similar to the individual right to\nproperty, the communal right to property entails a state duty to recognise and protect peaceful enjoyment of\nownership by a group or people subject to limitation by a state in the interest of public need or in the\ngeneral interest and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\n105. The Commission has also expressed the opinion that natural resources located in land owned or\noccupied by a people can be the subject of ownership in the context of the right to property under the\nAfrican Charter.20 In the Commission's view, protection of communal property rights to natural resources as\na component of land right enjoyed by indigenous peoples is not alien to the African Charter or to\ninternational human rights generally.21 One justification for the protection of this aspect of the right is the\nstrong traditional attachment to their cultural land that indigenous peoples hold on to such that their survival\ndepends on the resources they traditionally extract from the land.22\n106. The Commission notes that the Complainant does not claim that the people of Cabinda are indigenous\npeoples with strong attachment to their land and their culture. The basis of the Complainant's claim is that\nCabinda existed as a distinct Portuguese protectorate prior to 1975 when it was declared to be part of an\nindependent Angola without the consent of the people of Cabinda. The Commission does not believe that\ndistinct pre-colonial history on its own currently suffices to sustain a claim for special protection of a\ndistinctive overriding communal right to property under the Charter.\n107. In the absence of evidence that land in Cabinda is communally owned in a traditional context and that\nthe people of Cabinda had and continue to hold on to strong attachment to their land as part of a distinct\nculture which requires dependence on land and its resources for the survival of the people of Cabinda, the\nright to property can be validly limited by the State in the overall public interest of the entire state and in\naccordance with appropriate laws.\n108. In line with its obligation under International law, the African Charter and its domestic laws generally,\nthe Respondent State can only limit the right to property under certain laid down conditions. The\nComplainant has not claimed or adduced evidence to show that the limitation of the right in relation to the\npeople of Cabinda was not done in the public interest and according to appropriate laws.\n109. The Commission recalls the Complainant's argument that an incident of the right to property under the\nCharter is that the people of Cabinda are entitled to be the main beneficiaries of the natural resources and\nthat the Respondent State cannot unilaterally dispose of the natural resources of the people of Cabinda\nwithout their involvement in decisions on such disposal. The Commission agrees with the Complainant that\nas an aspect of the right to property under the Charter, the people of Cabinda are entitled to benefit from\nthe natural resource found in their lands. However, the Commission believes that the enjoyment of that\naspect of the right should not be to the detriment of other communities and groups in the State. The\nCommission notes further that the Respondent State's submission that the people of Cabinda (along with\nthe province of Zaire23 ) enjoy a fair and equitable share of the proceeds of the petroleum resources of the\nState has not been challenged despite the Complainant's claim that the people of Cabinda are entitled to\nan additional 50% of proceeds from natural resources.\n110. The Commission finds that the Complainant has failed to show that the people of Cabinda have a\nstrong and profound cultural or ancestral attachment to their land and the natural resources under the land\nsuch that their survival depends on its protection. The Complainant has also failed to show that the\nRespondent State has denied the people of Cabinda a right to share equitably in the benefits accruing from\ntheir natural resources. Accordingly, the African Commission finds no violation in relation to Article 14 of the\nAfrican Charter.\n\n11\n\n\fAlleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter\n\n111. The Complainant contends that the Respondent State has violated Article 19 of the Charter because\nthe people of Cabinda have not enjoyed the right to equality as a people entitled to the same respect and\nrights as other peoples in Angola. Article 19 provides that: All peoples shall be equal; they shall enjoy the\nsame respect and shall have the same rights. Nothing shall justify the domination of a people by another.\n112. It is the Complainant's submission that Article 19 of the Charter has been violated in relation to the\npeople of Cabinda because it anticipates that revenue from onshore resource extraction will \"flow to\nLuanda just as offshore revenue does now\". The Complainant alleges further that despite the resources\nextracted from Cabinda, unemployment is high and poverty, infant mortality and disease are higher in\nCabinda than in most other areas of Angola. Thus, it claims the Respondent State has violated Article 19 of\nthe African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\n113. In response to the alleged violation of Article 19 of the Charter, the Respondent State contends that its\nConstitution provides for the principle of equality and this is implemented in all its 18 provinces. The\nRespondent State argues further that 'it cannot implement measures aimed at developing the country\nbased on the premise that revenue should only be spent in areas where it is generated. The Respondent\nState submits that while it is developing the entire country, the Province of Cabinda enjoys a \"special status\nin view of its contribution towards the Angolan State General Budget\". Thus, it claims that it has not violated\nArticle 19 of the African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\n114. The Commission reaffirms its position that distinct and identifiable groups of \"peoples\" and\ncommunities exist within the State Parties to the African Charter and each set of \"peoples\" and\ncommunities is entitled to enjoy internal legal equality vis-?-vis other \"peoples\" and communities within the\nsame state.24 The Commission notes that a claim of unequal treatment in violation of Article 19 of the\nCharter requires evidence that a given group or set of peoples who is in a position similar to another group\nor set of people has been or is being treated differently or that a given group or set of peoples who is in a\nposition different to another group or set of people is treated similarly such that the \"peoples\" complaining\nsuffer unfair and unjustifiable disadvantage that amounts to discrimination.\n115. In its submission, the Complainant contends that the bulk of the anticipated revenue from the\nresources in Cabinda will \"flow to Luanda while only 10% or less will get to Cabinda\". The Complainant\ndoes not elaborate to show whether any single group of people in the Respondent State enjoys a greater\nshare of allocation than the People of Cabinda. The Complainant also provides no documentary or other\nevidence in support of its claim. The Complainant does not produce the 2006 Peace Accord which it refers\nto in its submission. However, the Respondent State does not contest the claims but admits them partially\nto the extent that the Respondent State submits that the Province of Cabinda enjoys a special status since\nit receives up to 10% of oil revenue.\n116. The Commission notes the Respondent State's submission that the 10% special revenue that accrues\nto Cabinda is in addition to other infrastructural costs that the Government funds in the Province of\nCabinda. Although the Respondent State has also failed to adduce any documentary or other evidence in\nsupport of this claim, the Complainant has not contested the Respondent State's claim that only the\nProvince of Cabinda (along with the Province of Zaire) enjoy the \"special status\". Accordingly, the\nCommission will make its decision on the basis of the unchallenged submissions of the Parties.\n117. Generally, the Commission holds the view that real or substantive equality requires that groups who\nhave suffered previous disadvantages or continue to suffer disadvantages within a state are entitled to\nsome advantageous treatment especially where such groups bear an unequal part of the burden for the\nexploration of natural resources in that state.25 However, the Commission also notes the Respondent\nState's argument that it cannot implement measures that aim at spending revenue only in areas where it is\ngenerated.\n118. The Commissions takes the view that the principle of equality requires the striking of a balance\nbetween a group's claim to advantageous treatment or affirmative action and the legitimate expectation of\nother groups within the state to share in the resources of that state. Accordingly, the Commission believes\nthat a proper interpretation of equality in the present circumstance is one which recognises the right of the\npeople of Cabinda to receive some advantage without endangering the survival of other peoples within the\nstate or threatening the continued corporate existence of the Respondent State.\n119. Although the Complainant contends that the people of Cabinda suffer unequal treatment as compared\nto the rest of Angola in terms of comparatively higher levels of unemployment, poverty, infant mortality and\ndisease, no tangible evidence or data has been adduced to support these claims. As this Commission had\n12\n\n\fpreviously observed, a Complainant that has made general claims and allegations needs to substantiate\nsuch claims and allegations with either documentary evidence or sworn affidavits or the corroborating\ntestimony of others.26 In the absence of evidence to support the claim of unequal treatment, the\nCommission does not find a violation of Article 19 of the Charter.\nAlleged violation of Article 20 of the African Charter\n\n120. Basing its argument on an acclaimed geographical, political, linguistic and cultural distinction from the\nrest of Angola, the Complainant claims that the Respondent State has violated the right of the people of\nCabinda to social and economic development as guaranteed in Article 20 of the African Charter. The\nComplainant submits that the people of Cabinda are unable to exercise the right because organisations\nthat \"espouse a uniquely Cabindan point of view\" are banned by the Government of Angola.\n121. The Complainant alleges further that the enjoyment of the right to social and economic development is\nrestricted because people who campaign for economic self-determination are routinely arrested. On these\ngrounds, the Complainant alleges that the right of the people of Cabinda to social and economic\ndevelopment had been violated.\n122. The Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 20 of the African Charter in relation to\nthe people of Cabinda because the right to self-determination had been collectively fulfilled by the entire\npeople of Angola at independence in 1975. The Respondent State submits further the periodic democratic\nelections take place in Angola and as citizens of Angola, the people of Cabinda have participated fully at\nsuch elections, producing 5 out of 220 deputies elected to the Angolan Parliament.\n123. It is the Respondent State's further contention that Cabinda also has its own political and\nadministrative structures defined by Angolan law. On these grounds and in view of Article 87 of its\nConstitution which acknowledges that Angola is a multicultural and multilingual society where the different\nidentities are to be appreciated and respected, the Respondent State contends that it has not violated\nArticle 20 of the African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\n124. The Commission recalls that Article 20 of the Charter has a particular historical context in the sense\nthat it is one of the provisions of the Charter that was aimed at addressing the situation of Africans who\nremained under colonial domination at the time the Charter was drafted. Article 20 of the Charter provides\nthat :\n\n1. All peoples shall have the right to existence. They shall have the unquestionable and inalienable\nright to self-determination. They shall freely determine their political status and shall pursue their\neconomic and social development according to the policy they have freely chosen.\n2. Colonised or oppressed people shall have the right to free themselves from the bonds of domination\nby resorting to any means recognised by the international community.\n3. All peoples shall have the right to the assistance of the State Parties to the present Charter in their\nliberation struggle against foreign domination, be it political, economic or cultural.\n125. The Commission notes the argument of the Complainant regarding the alleged violation of Article 20\nof the Charter. In view of its opinion that the right to self-determination, the right of colonised and oppressed\npeople to free themselves from domination and the right to assistance in liberation struggle are reserved for\ncolonised peoples, the Commission does not agree with the Complainant that a distinct pre-colonial history\nby itself entitles the people of Cabinda to unilaterally claim those rights contained vis-?-vis the Respondent\nState.\n126. As the Commission has noted in its earlier jurisprudence, in post-colonial Africa, the right to self\ndetermination can be enjoyed within the existing territories and with full respect for the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of State Parties to the Charter.27 The Commission also believes that the right to pursue\neconomic and social development is attainable within the framework of an existing state insofar as different\ngroups and communities are represented in decision-making institutions of the given state. Accordingly, the\nCommission does not find any violation of Article 20 of the Charter.\n\n13\n\n\fAlleged violation of Article 21 of the African Charter\n\n127. In relation to Article 21, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated the right of\nthe people of Cabinda to freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources because the Respondent\nState has made grants and concessions on Cabinda's onshore oil resources \"without input from the\nCabindans\". The Complainant contends that the acts the Respondent State in this regard amount to\nspoliation under Article 21 of the Charter and should attract a right to lawful recovery and to an adequate\ncompensation. Article 21 of the African Charter states as follows:\n\n1. All peoples shall freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources. This right shall be exercised in\nthe exclusive interest of the people. In no case shall a people be deprived of it.\n2. In all cases of spoliation, the disposed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of its\nproperty as well as to an adequate compensation.\n3. The free disposal of wealth and natural resources shall be exercised without prejudice to the\nobligation of promoting international economic cooperation based on mutual respect, equitable\nexchange and the principles of international law.\n4. State Parties to the present Charter shall individually and collectively exercise the right to free\ndisposal of their wealth and natural resources with a view to strengthening African Unity and\nsolidarity.\n5. State Parties to the present Charter shall undertake to eliminate all forms of foreign exploitation\nparticularly that practiced by all international monopolies so as to enable their peoples to fully\nbenefit from the advantages derived from their national resources.\n128. The Respondent State argues that by Articles 94 and 95 of its Constitution, natural resources fall in\nthe category of items classified as property in the public domain which are reserved to serve national rather\nnarrow local interests. The Respondent State submits further the Province of Cabinda already receives\nspecial attention for its contribution to oil revenues. Asserting its sovereign authority and legitimacy to\nexplore natural resources in Angolan territory, the Respondent State challenges the authority and\nlegitimacy of the Complainant to speak on behalf of the people of Cabinda with regards to the exploitation\nof natural resources.\n129. The Commission recalls its jurisprudence which traces the origin of Article 21 to the colonial era when\nhuman and material resources in Africa were exploited for the benefit of powers from outside the\ncontinent.28 However, the Commission has also held that the rights in Article 21 of the Charter are still\napplicable in post-colonial Africa in favour of groups within states to the extent that it triggers an obligation\non the part of the State Parties to protect their citizens from exploitation by external economic powers29 and\nto ensure that groups and communities, directly or through their representatives, are involved in decisions\nrelating to the disposal of their wealth.30 Nevertheless, the Commission also recognises the right of State\nParties to supervise the disposal of wealth in the general interest of the state and its communities.31\n130. The Commission notes that in relation to Article 21 of the Charter, the Complaint invokes a right of the\npeople of Cabinda to dispose of their wealth and natural resources as well as to receive compensation for\nresources already exploited. In this regard, the Commission notes that the term \"peoples\" in Article 21 of\nthe Charter can mean either the entire peoples of a given state or a \"peoples\" within the state. The\nCommission believes that in the first context, Article 21 of the African Charter empowers a State Party to\nexercise the guaranteed right free from interference from any other African or non-African state. This has to\nbe the explanation for sub-Articles 4 and 5 of Article 21 which speak to State Parties.\n131. However, the Commission believes that a \"peoples\" within an existing state can be beneficiaries of the\nright in Article 21 to the extent that it imposes a duty on the Respondent State to ensure that resources are\neffectively managed for the sole and equal benefit of the entire peoples of the state. Accordingly, the\nAfrican Commission is of the view that one aspect of the right in Article 21 of the African Charter is the duty\nof the State to involve representatives of its peoples in decisions concerning the management of national\nwealth and natural resources.\n132. The Respondent State has shown that elected representatives of the people of Cabinda are in the\nAngolan Parliament which exercises oversight supervision of the management of natural resources. As this\nCommission noted in SERAC v Nigeria,32 the State has the right to exploit natural resources in its territory.\nHowever, the Commission believes that Article 21 of the African Charter presupposes that that right is held\n14\n\n\fin trust for the people. The Respondent State's submission that it effectively manages natural resources for\nthe benefit of all peoples in Angola has not been challenged. The Commission therefore finds no violation\nof Article 21 of the Charter.\nAlleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter\n\n133. The Complainant's allegation that the Respondent State has violated Article 22 of the African Charter\nwith regards to the people of Cabinda is based exclusively on the argument that the Respondent State\npursues a policy of \"Angolanisation of Cabinda\". In the absence of any other argument or evidence in\nsupport, the African Commission finds no violation.\nAlleged violation of Article 24 of the African Charter\n\n134. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated Article 24 of the African Charter in\nrelation to the people of Cabinda because, as a result of oil exploitation activities authorised by the State,\nthe environment in Cabinda is not conducive for the development of the people of Cabinda. The\nComplainant argues further that the operations of companies such as Chevron which are authorised by the\nRespondent State take place in conditions that harm both human health and the environment and this has\nhappened because in the absence of viable civil society monitoring, the Respondent State has failed to\nenforce compliance with environmental rules.\n135. The Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 24 of the African Charter in relation to\nthe people of Cabinda since it has taken measures aimed at preserving the environment. The Respondent\nState cites national legislations that it has adopted to address the challenge of environmental pollution. The\nRespondent State submits further that it has compelled oil companies operating in the area to account for\nharm occasioned by oil spills, with emphasis on demanding compensation for fishermen and their families.\nThe Respondent also claims that it has set up a National Environment Surveillance Service that has kept\ntrack of at least six oil spills in the area while its Ministry of Environment has audited rigs in the Angolan sea\nto prevent further spills. In effect, the Respondent State contends that it has taken action to address the\nconcerns of the Complainant.\n136. The African Commission notes that apart from the fact that it did not adduce any evidence in support\nof the general allegation that the right to a satisfactory environment has been violated by the Respondent\nState, the Complainant has not disputed or challenged the claims of the Respondent State. In the absence\nof any evidence to support the alleged violation, the African Commission finds no violation of Article 24 of\nthe African Charter.\n\nDecision of the African Commission\n137. In view of the above, the African Commission finds no violations of Articles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24\nof the African Charter as alleged by the Complainants.\nDone in Banjul, the Gambia during the 54th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human\nand Peoples Rights, 22 October to 5 November 2013.\n\nFootnotes\n1 Angola ratified the African Charter on 2 March 1990.\n2 The alleged violations include extrajudicial/summary executions, arbitrary arrests and detention, sexual\nviolence, denial of civilians' freedom of movement, torture and other mistreatment.\n3 By email to the Secretariat dated 17 Feb 2012, Dr Levy advised the Secretariat to consider submission\nfrom Cabindan groups other himself as amicus briefs.\n4 Notes Verbale were sent to the Republic of Angola on 28 February 2007, 10 May 2007, 20 August 2007,\n19 December 2007, 25 March 2009, 27 April 2009, 23 June 2010, 30 September 2010, 7 December 2010\nand 11 August 2011.\n5 Communication 292/04 - Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa v.

Without them, the very physical and cultural survival of such\npeoples is at stake.123 Hence the need to protect the lands and resources they have traditionally used to\nprevent their extinction as a people. That is, the aim and purpose of the special measures required on\nbehalf of the members of indigenous and tribal communities is to guarantee that they may continue living\ntheir traditional way of life, and that their distinct cultural identity, social structure, economic system,\ncustoms, beliefs and traditions are respected, guaranteed and protected by States.\n.\n22 Ibid\n23 The Respondent State submits that the Province of Zaire also contributes significantly to the natural\nresources of Angola and accordingly, together with the Cabinda Province, enjoy certain privileges over and\nabove other provinces.\n24 COHRE case, para 223\n25 This is consistent with international best practices. See for instance, the Saramaka decision, para 103\n× Furthermore, the State's argument that it would be discriminatory to pass legislation that recognizes\ncommunal forms of land ownership is also without merit. It is a wellestablished principle of international law\nthat unequal treatment towards persons in unequal situations does not necessarily amount to impermissible\ndiscrimination. Legislation that recognizes said differences is therefore not necessarily discriminatory. In the\ncontext of members of indigenous and tribal peoples, this Court has already stated that special measures\nare necessary in order to ensure their survival in accordance with their traditions and customs (supra paras.\n78-86, 91, and 96). Thus, the State's arguments regarding its inability to create legislation in this area due\nto the alleged complexity of the issue or the possible discriminatory nature of such legislation are without\nmerit.\n26 Communication 308/05 - Majuru v Zimbabwe (2008) ACHPR, para 92\n27 Communication 75/92 - Katangese Peoples' Congress v Zaire (1995) ACHPR para 4\n28 Communication 155/96 - Social and Economic Rights Action Center (SERAC) & Center for Economic\nand Social Rights (CESR) v Nigeria (SERAC v Nigeria) (2001) para 56\n16\n\n\f29 SERAC v Nigeria, paras 57-58\n30 Endorois v Kenya, para 268\n31 Ibid\n32 155/96 para 54\n\n17\n\n\f"},{"_id":"f2cb1f37c9ac9095ca5f14426305dd1f","title":"313 05 Kenneth Good  Republic of Botswana","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"4-59cf1b25af945b4012dcad00e22ae49a","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1464788927204,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"313_05 Kenneth Good _ Republic of Botswana.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1464788929145ile40ngrlmasv2t9.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1464788929145ile40ngrlmasv2t9.pdf","size":54771},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"313/05 Kenneth Good / Republic of Botswana\nSummary of the Complaint\n1. The complaint is submitted by INTERIGHTS, Anton Katz and Max du Plessis (Complainants) on behalf\nof Mr Kenneth Good (victim), against the Republic of Botswana (Respondent State).\n2. The complaint states that Mr Kenneth Good, an Australian national, teaching at the University of\nBotswana, had his employment terminated after his expulsion from Botswana on 31st May 2005.\n3. It is submitted that in February 2005, in his capacity as Professor of Political Studies at the University of\nBotswana, the victim co-authored an article concerning presidential succession in Botswana. The article\ncriticised the Government, and concluded that Botswana is a poor example of African presidential\nsuccession.\n4. The Complainants submit that, on 18th February 2005, the President of Botswana, exercising the powers\nvested in him by section 7(f) of the Botswana Immigration Act, decided to declare the victim an undesirable\ninhabitant of, or visitor to, Botswana. The victim was not given reasons for this decision, nor was he given\nany opportunity to contest it.\n5. On 7th March 2005, the victim launched a constitutional challenge in the Botswana High Court. On 31st\nMay 2005, the High Court dismissed the application ruling that Section 7 (f) of the Botswana Immigration\nAct relates to what the President considers to be in the best interest of Botswana, and Sections 11(6) and\n36 of the same Act make the President's declaration unassailable on the merits.\n6. On 31st May 2005, the victim was deported from Botswana to South Africa.\n7. On 7th June 2005, the victim filed a notice and grounds of appeal in the Court of Appeal of the Republic\nof Botswana. On 27th July 2005, the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment dismissing the victim's appeal.\nThe Court of Appeal held that the President, in making such declarations, is empowered to act in what he\nconsiders to be the best interest of the country, without judicial oversight.\n8. The Complainants submit that the Court of Appeal is the highest judicial authority in Botswana. No\nfurther right of appeal or challenge lies from the decision of this court.\n\nComplaint\n9. The Complainants allege that the Respondent State has violated Articles 1, 2, 7 (1) (a), 9, 12 (4), and 18\nof the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.\n\nProcedure\n10. The communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on 24th November 2005.\n11. During the 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2006, the African\nCommission was seized of the communication.\n12. On 15th December 2005, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties accordingly\nand requested them to submit arguments on admissibility. The Secretariat of the African Commission\nforwarded a copy of the complaint to the Respondent State.\n13. On 13th March 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received written submissions on\nadmissibility from the Complainants.\n14. By Note Verbale dated 5th April 2006, the Secretariat forwarded a copy of the Complainants'\nsubmission on admissibility to the Respondent State and reminded the latter to submit its arguments on the\nsame.\n15. On 18th April 2006, the Secretariat received an e-mail from one of the lawyers of the alleged victim\nrequesting to be invited to make oral submission at the 39th Ordinary Session.\n16. On 6th May 2006, the Secretariat received the submission on admissibility from the Respondent State.\n17. On 10th May 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission received a letter from the Centre for\nHuman Rights of the University of Pretoria submitting an amicus curiae brief.\n18. On 20th May 2006, the Secretariat received further submission on admissibility from the Respondent\nState.\n19. At its 39th Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the communication and decided to\ndefer it to its 40th Ordinary Session.\n1\n\n\f20. By Note Verbale and by letter dated 14th July 2006, the Secretariat notified both parties of the decision\nof the Commission and informed them that they can make further submission on admissibility if they so\nwished.\n21. On 3rd October 2006, the Secretariat received a fax from the Complainants forwarding a copy of a letter\nof appeal addressed by the victim to the President of the Republic of Botswana, and the response of the\nSenior Private Secretary to the President.\n22. On 4th October 2006, the Secretariat received the Complainants' response to the Respondent State's\nfurther submission on admissibility.\n23. On 7th November 2006, the Secretariat received a letter from the Respondent State requesting the\nCommission to purge the Complainants' additional submissions from the record because the State was not\ninvited to make additional submission.\n24. At its 40th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia, from 15th to 29th November 2006, both parties\nwere given audience before the Commission and the State requested to receive copy of the letter sent to\nthe Complainants inviting further arguments, and to be given time to respond to the additional submissions\nmade by the Complainants.\n25. The Commission decided to defer consideration of the communication to its 41st Ordinary Session and\ninstructed the Secretariat to forward a copy of the above letter to the Respondent State.\n26. By Note Verbale dated 12th February 2007, the Secretariat forwarded the above letter to the\nRespondent State and requested the latter to submit its observation on the same.\n27. On 25th April 2007, the Secretariat received the response of the Respondent State on the\nComplainants' further submissions.\n28. By Note Verbale dated 30th April 2007, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Respondent State's\nresponse.\n29. At its 41st Ordinary Session, the African Commission considered the communication and decided to\ndeclare it admissible.\n30. By Note Verbale of 20th June 2007 and letter of the same date, both parties were notified of the\nCommission's decision.\n31. On 2nd October 2007 and 10th October 2007, the Secretariat received the Complainants' and\nRespondent State's submissions on the merits, respectively.\n32. By Note Verbale of 22nd October 2007 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat acknowledged\nreceipt of the Complainants' and Respondent State's submissions on the merits and forwarded each other's\nsubmission to the other party.\n33. At the 42nd Ordinary Session the Secretariat received the Complainants' response to the Respondent\nState's submissions on the merits.\n34. During the same 42nd Ordinary Session, the Respondent State raised a preliminary objection on the\nprocedure of the Commission and the Commission decided to defer the communication to allow the\nSecretariat prepare a decision on the preliminary objection.\n35. By Note Verbale of 19th December 2007 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat informed both\nparties of the Commission's decision.\n36. At its 44th Ordinary Session, the Commission dismissed the Respondent State's preliminary objections\nand requested that both parties submit within three months, their responses to the submissions of the other\nparty.\n37. By Note Verbale of 5th January 2009 and letter of the same date, both parties were informed of the\nCommission's decision and requested to make further submissions on the merits within three months.\n38. On 3rd February 2009, the Respondent State requested for a month extension of time to make further\nsubmissions on the merits.\n39. By Note Verbale of 9th February 2009, the Secretariat granted the extension of time requested by the\nRespondent State.\n40. By letter of 10th February 2009, the Complainant was informed of the extension of time granted to the\nRespondent State.\n41. By a Note Verbale dated 27th March 2009, the Secretariat invited the Respondent State to forward its\nfurther submissions on the merits.\n42. On 7th November 2009, the Respondent State made a complaint regarding the procedures followed by\nthe Secretariat in inviting the parties to make further submissions on the merits.\n43. On 8th April 2009, the Respondent State made further submissions objecting against the Commission's\napproach and application of the procedure laid down in Rule 119(2) [and] (3) of [its] Rules [of] Procedure\n2\n\n\fand requested the Commission to review its ruling.\n44. By Note Verbale dated 14th April 2009, the Secretariat notified the Respondent State of the\nCommission's decision to take a decision on the merits during its 45th Ordinary Session and further invited\nthe State to make its submissions no later than 30th April 2009.\n45. By a Note Verbale of 16th April 2009, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State that the latter's\nconcerns and issues will be tabled before the Commission during its 45th Ordinary Session.\n46. By a letter and Note Verbale of 7th December 2009, the Complainants and Respondent State were\ninformed of the Commission's decision to defer consideration of the communication to its 47th Ordinary\nSession.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\nComplainants' submission\n\n47. The Complainants submit that the requirements set in Article 56 of the African Charter have been\nsatisfied, as the author of the communication has been identified and relevant details of the Communication\nhave been provided to the Commission, including details of those individuals and organisations\nrepresenting the victim. According to the Complainants, the communication is compatible with the\nConstitutive Act of the African Union and with the African Charter. The communication is presented in a\npolite and respectful language, and is based on information provided by the victim and on court documents,\nnot on media reports. The Complainants state that the present communication has not been submitted to\nany other international human rights body for investigation or settlement.\n48. The Complainants claim that on 7th March 2005, the victim launched an application challenging the\nconstitutionality of the Botswana Immigration Act. The application, which challenged the President's\ndecision to expel him from Botswana, was dismissed by the High Court of Botswana in a unanimous\njudgment. They submit that the High Court in its judgment found that the President's declaration under\nSection 7(f) of the Immigration Act relates to what the President considers to be in the best interests of\nBotswana and Sections 11(6) and 36 of the same Act make the President's declaration unassailable on the\nmerits.\n49. The Complainants submit further that on 7th June 2005, the victim filed a notice and grounds of appeal\nto the Court of Appeal, in which he sought an order setting aside both the judgment appealed against and\nthe decision of the President of 18th February 2005. On 27th July 2005, the Court of Appeal delivered a\njudgment dismissing the victim's appeal. The Court of Appeal held that the President in making such\ndeclarations is empowered to act in what he considers to be the best interests of the country, without\njudicial oversight and that the Parliament which decreed that the President's decisions are not subject to\ndisclosure did not act ultra vires in doing so.\n50. The Complainants aver that both Courts found that the President, in making his declaration that the\nvictim was an \"undesirable inhabitant or visitor to Botswana\", is empowered to act in what he considers to\nbe the best interests of the country, without judicial oversight. The Courts ruled that in terms of the Act, the\nPresident's decisions are not subject to disclosure or challenge in a court of law and he did not act ultra\nvires.\n51. The Complainants submit that the Court of Appeal is the highest judicial authority in Botswana and no\nfurther right of appeal or challenge lies from the decision of this Court.\n52. As a result of the above, the Complainants argue that all domestic remedies available in the\nRespondent State have been exhausted for the purpose of Article 56(5). They also submit that the\ncommunication is brought before the Commission within three months of having exhausted such domestic\nremedies, pursuant to Article 56(6).\nRespondent State's Submissions\n\n53. In its submissions, the Respondent State challenges the Commission's existence and its competence\nto hear the case. Regarding the existence of the Commission, the Respondent State submits that the\nCommission was established within the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and that the OAU ceased to\nexist in July 2001, and no provision was made for the continuance of the work of the Commission in the\n3\n\n\fConstitutive Act of the African Union (AU) that took over from the OAU.\n54. The State further submits that Article 5\n× Article 5 Organs of the Union\n1. The organs of the Union shall be: (a) The Assembly of the Union; (b) The Executive Council; (c) The\nPan-African Parliament; (d) The Court of Justice; (e) The Commission; (f) The Permanent Representatives\nCommittee; (g) The Specialised Technical Committees; (h) The Economic, Social and Cultural Council; (i)\nThe Financial Institutions;\n2. Other organs that the Assembly may decide to establish.\nof the Constitutive Act, which lists the AU Organs, does not mention the African Commission, and that the\nAU did not make use of the capacity vested in it under Article 9(1) (d)\n× The functions of the Assembly shall be to:...d. Establish any organ of the Union;\nof the Constitutive Act to establish any other organ to bring the Commission back to existence. The\nRespondent State therefore concludes that the Commission has ceased to exist along with the OAU.\n55. However, the Respondent State does not challenge the existence of the African Charter, which it\nconsiders a \"mere instrument of noble ideals which unfortunately is devoid of any operational structures...\".\n56. With respect to the Commission's competence rationae materae (subject matter of the communication),\nthe Respondent State holds that the communication concerns immigration matters which are not part of the\nmandate of the Commission spelled out in Article 45 of the Charter. The State submits further that in terms\nof [popup=Article 13] Functions of the Executive Council\n1. The Executive Council shall coordinate and take decisions on policies in areas of common interest to the\nMember States, including the following:\n\n1. foreign trade;\n2. energy, industry and mineral resources;\n3. food, agricultural and animal resources, livestock production and forestry;\n4. water resources and irrigation;\n5. environmental protection, humanitarian action and disaster response and relief;\n6. transport and communications;\n7. insurance;\n8. education, culture, health and human resources development;\n9. science and technology;\n10. nationality, residency and immigration matters;\n11. social security, including the formulation of mother and child care policies, as well as policies\nrelating to the disabled and the handicapped;\n12. establishment of a system of African awards, medals and prizes.\n2. The Executive Council shall be responsible to the Assembly. It shall consider issues referred to it and\nmonitor the implementation of policies formulated by the Assembly.\n3. The Executive Council may delegate any of its powers and functions mentioned in paragraph 1 of this\nArticle to the Specialised Technical Committees established under Article 14 of this Act.[/popup] of the\nConstitutive Act, it is the Executive Council which is responsible for immigration matters.\n57. The Respondent State argues that in case the Commission finds itself to be in existence and to have\njurisdiction over the matter, the communication should notwithstanding be declared inadmissible for\nnon-compliance with Article 56 of the African Charter.\n58. It is the State's view that the communication is not compatible with the African Charter. It submits that\nnot all the elements of the communication have been disclosed to the State, placing the latter \"in an\nuntenable position where it does not know the exact nature of the Complaint against it,\" and that therefore\nthe communication is irregular and/or non-compliant with Rule 104(e) as read with Article 56(2) of the\nAfrican Charter.\n59. The Respondent State also states that Article 23(1) of the African Charter recognises peoples' rights to\nnational and international peace and security, and that Article 12(2) allows States Parties to restrict the right\nto freedom of movement by means of law for the \"protection of national security, law and order...\". The\n4\n\n\fState holds that the interpretation of these provisions is that \"States must be left alone and allowed to deal\nwith matters of peace and national security\". The Respondent State submits that the matter before the\nCommission involves national security and that the Commission has no competence over it.\n60. The Respondent State further submits that the decision to expel the victim was taken by the President\nin accordance with the law as required under Article 12(4) of the African Charter.\n61. The Respondent State argues that the victim's expulsion was confirmed by the courts and that the\nState has the obligation under Article 26 of the Charter to guarantee the independence of the judiciary and\ncannot interfere with their rulings.\n62. The Respondent State also states that the victim's appeal to courts in Botswana was dismissed with\ncosts, which he has not yet paid, and that by instituting proceedings before the Commission he is just trying\nto escape his obligation in Botswana. The State concludes that the communication is frivolous and\nvexatious, and that it should be rejected and held inadmissible.\n63. The Respondent State further submits that the victim did not avail himself of the possibility offered to\nhim to resort to the President to review the decision expelling him. It is therefore the State's submission that\nlocal remedies have not been exhausted.\n64. For all the aforementioned reasons, the Respondent State prays the Commission to declare the\ncommunication inadmissible.\nResponse of the Complainants to the Respondent State's submission on admissibility\n\n65. The Complainants submit that the fact that the OAU ceased to exist does not affect the existence of the\nCommission, and that the latter continues to exist de facto and de jure. De facto, the work of the\nCommission was not hindered or suspended as a result of the coming into force of the AU Constitutive Act:\nit continued considering communications; holding sessions; undertaking visits to State Parties, including the\nRespondent State, which continues to collaborate with it. De jure, the AU Assembly, by its decision, ruled\nthat the Commission \"shall henceforth operate within the framework of the African Union\".\n66. The Complainants argue that the African Charter established the Commission and the fact that the\nAfrican Charter is still in force, as the Respondent State did acknowledge, is tantamount to recognising the\nexistence of the African Commission.\n67. With respect to the disclosure of documents to the State, the Complainants argue that the\ncommunication is not based on media reports but on the information provided by the victim and on court\ndocuments, and that only two judgments have been enclosed because they are the only ones relevant at\nthe particular stage of the proceedings and from the point of view of exhaustion of domestic remedies.\n68. The Complainants also challenge the argument of the Respondent State that the Commission does not\nhave jurisdiction over immigration matters. They submit that that Article 45(2) mandates the Commission to\nprotect human rights generally, without leaving out the rights of immigrants or people facing deportation,\nnoting that Article 12 of the Charter makes clear reference to migration.\n69. The Complainants finally submit that the other points of the State's submission relate to the merits and\nshould not be considered at this stage of the procedure, adding that the communication meets all the\nadmissibility requirements and should be declared admissible.\nRespondent State's reaction to the Complainant's response to its submissions\n\n70. In an oral submission during the 40th Ordinary Session of the Commission, and by letter dated 22nd\nMarch 2007, the Respondent State submitted that the additional submission on admissibility by the\nComplainants should be purged from the record of proceedings because the invitation to make additional\nsubmission was a misuse of the procedure under Rule 119 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure. It is\nthe Respondent State's view that no reason was given for inviting the Complainants to submit and that the\nletter was signed by a Finance and Administration Officer (FAO), who is not a member of the Commission,\nand in inviting the Complainants to submit, the FAO unlawfully participated in the deliberations or decisions\nof the Commission.\n71. The Respondent State goes on to reiterate its statement that the Commission is an emanation of the\nCharter, which established it to work within the OAU. The dissolution of the OAU, the State submits,\ndeprived the Commission of the legitimacy and authority as mechanism for the settling of disputes.\nAccording to the Respondent State, in the absence of an amendment to Article 30 of the African Charter to\nenable the Commission to operate within the AU, and without an AU decision integrating the Commission\nas an organ of the AU, the African Commission lacks legal basis to continue performing its mandate under\n5\n\n\fthe African Charter.\nDecision of the Commission on the Respondent State's challenge of its existence and competence\n\n72. Considering that the Respondent State contests the existence of the African Commission and its\njurisdiction to hear the matter complained of, the Commission will deal with those two points before dealing\nwith the admissibility of the communication.\n73. Regarding the existence of the Commission, the Respondent State submits that the Commission was\nestablished within the OAU, and that the OAU ceased to exist in July 2001 and no provision was made for\nthe continuance of the work of the Commission in the Constitutive Act of the African Union that took over\nfrom the OAU.\n74. According to the Respondent State, Article 5\n× 1. The organs of the Union shall be:\n1. The Assembly of the Union;\n2. The Executive Council;\n3. The Pan-African Parliament;\n4. The Court of Justice;\n5. The Commission;\n6. The Permanent Representatives Committee;\n7. The Specialised Technical Committees;\n8. The Economic, Social and Cultural Council;\n9. The Financial Institutions;\n\n2. Other organs that the Assembly may decide to establish.\nof the Constitutive Act, which lists the AU Organs, does not mention the African Commission, and the AU\ndid not make use of the capacity vested in it under Article 9(1)(d)\n× 1. The functions of the Assembly shall be to: (d) establish any organ of the Union\nof the Constitutive Act to establish any other organ to bring the Commission back to existence. The\nRespondent State therefore concludes that the Commission has ceased to exist along with the OAU.\n75. In terms of Article 30 of the African Charter, \"An African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, ...\nshall be established within the Organisation of African Unity to promote human and peoples' rights and\nensure their protection in Africa\". It is the Commission's view that having been established by the African\nCharter, the termination of a treaty other than the Charter cannot affect its existence.\n76. The Commission would like to emphasise that although it was established by the African Charter and\nnot a direct emanation of the OAU Charter, it was operating within the framework of the OAU, the latter\nbeing the main political organisation on the continent. As an organisation working within the framework of\nthe OAU, the Commission relied on the OAU for its funding and its staffing,1 and for the execution of its\ndecisions against Members States found to be in violation of the Charter2 . With the coming into force of the\nConstitutive Act, all the \"assets and liabilities\" of the OAU \"... and all matters relating thereto'' including\nrelevant institutions established within the OAU, were devolved to the AU3 . That is why, the Heads of State\nand Government of the AU, at their first Ordinary Session held in Durban, South Africa, from 8th to 10th July\n2002, accepted to take over the obligations the OAU used to bear vis-?-vis the African Commission. In its\ndecision on the Interim Period, the Assembly of the African Union decided that \"the African Commission on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights and the African Committee of Experts on Rights and Welfare of the Child shall\nhenceforth operate within the framework of the African Union\"4 .\n77. As a matter of fact, the AU assumed towards the Commission the same obligations as previously borne\nby the OAU. The AU appoints the 11 Members of the Commission, provides staff to the Secretariat, funds\nthe day-to-day work of the Commission, and adopts the reports submitted by the Commission. Moreover,\nMember States of the AU (which are also State Parties to the African Charter), including the Respondent\nState, continue to cooperate with the African Commission, by submitting their reports under Article 62 of the\nCharter, by hosting sessions and missions of the Commission, and by actively participating in the\ncommunication procedures when complaints are brought against them before the Commission.\n78. The Commission takes note of the fact that, although it challenges the existence of the Commission as\n6\n\n\fa monitoring body, the Respondent State does not contest the existence of the Charter itself. The\nCommission observes that, unlike some other international human rights systems where the substantive\nrights and their monitoring bodies are dealt within two complementary but different instruments, in the\nAfrican system, the same instrument, the African Charter, makes provisions for substantive rights and\norganises their monitoring mechanism5 . Under the Charter, therefore, States Parties are not given the\noption of recognising the substantive rights without accepting the jurisdiction of the African Commission,\nwhich was established to promote and protect those rights.\n79. The Commission concludes that the termination of the OAU Charter and subsequent dissolution of the\nOAU does not affect its existence. The Commission is still in existence and performs its activities within the\nframework of the AU.\n80. Regarding the jurisdiction of the Commission over immigration matters, the Commission is of the view\nthat there is no provision in the African Charter or in the Constitutive Act excluding the jurisdiction of the\nAfrican Commission over such matters. The jurisdiction of the Commission is founded by Article 45 of the\nAfrican Charter which reads: \"The functions of the Commission shall be [to]: 2. Ensure the protection of\nhuman and peoples' rights under conditions laid down by the present Charter.\"\n81. This provision should be read together with the relevant substantive provisions of the Charter to find out\nwhether, under its protection mandate, the Commission has jurisdiction over a given matter. Regarding\nspecifically immigration matters, Article 12 of the Charter states that:\n1. \"Every individual shall have the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of a\n2.\nState provided he abides by the law.\n3. Every individual shall have the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his\ncountry. This right may only be subject to restrictions, provided for by law for the protection of\nnational security, law and order, public health or morality.\n4. Every individual shall have the right, when persecuted, to seek and obtain asylum in other countries\nin accordance with the law of those countries and international conventions.\n5. A non-national legally admitted in a territory of a State Party to the present Charter, may only be\nexpelled from it by virtue of a decision taken in accordance with the law.\n6. The mass expulsion of non-nationals shall be prohibited. Mass expulsion shall be that which is\naimed at national, racial, ethnic or religious groups.\"\n82. It appears from the provision of Article 45(2), read together with Article 12, that the Commission has\njurisdiction when some human rights related to immigration are involved. The mandate of the Commission\nin that case is to make sure that, immigration policies and practices do not infringe upon those rights.\nHence, the Commission finds that it has jurisdiction over immigration matters.\n83. The Commission is of the view that the competence given to it over immigration matters under Article\n45(2) and Article 12 of the Charter, does not overlap with the mandate of the Executive Council, under\nArticle 13(1)(j)\n× 1. The Executive Council shall coordinate and take decisions on policies in areas of common interest to\nthe Member States, including the following: (j) nationality, residency and immigration matters;\nof the Constitutive Act, over the same matters because the two bodies do not perform the same kind of\nactivity. While the Commission is an international quasi-judicial institution established to promote and\nprotect the rights enshrined in the African Charter, the Executive Council is a political organ, which\n\"coordinate[s] and take[s] decisions on policies in areas of common interest to the member states [of the\nAfrican Union], including...nationality, residency and immigration matters\"6 .\n84. Having dealt with the preliminary objections raised by the Respondent State regarding the existence\nand jurisdiction of the Commission, the latter will now proceed to make a determination on the admissibility\nor otherwise of this communication.\nThe Commission's analysis on admissibility\n\n85. The admissibility of communications submitted before the African Commission in accordance with\nArticle 55 is governed by the requirements of Article 56 of the African Charter. In terms of Article 56:\n\"Communications relating to human and peoples' rights referred to in Article 55 received by the\nCommission, shall be considered if they:\n\n7\n\n\f1. Indicate their authors even if the latter requests anonymity,\n2. Are compatible with the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or with the present Charter,\n3. Are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned and its\ninstitutions or to the Organisation of African Unity,\n4. Are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass media,\n5. Are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly\nprolonged,\n6. Are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted or from the\ndate the Commission is seized with the matter, and\n7. Do not deal with cases which have been settled by those States involved in accordance with the\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, or the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity or\nthe provisions of the present Charter.\"\n86. The African Commission is of the view that this communication establishes a prima facie violation of the\nprovisions of the African Charter, and is compatible with both the Constitutive Act of the African Union and\nthe African Charter. The African Commission also does not believe that there has been any use of a\ndisparaging or insulting language against the Government of the Republic of Botswana or any of its\ninstitutions or the African Union.\n87. Regarding the disclosure of documents, the Commission finds that the documents submitted by the\nComplainants in support of the claim sufficiently prove that the communication is not based on fiction or on\nnews disseminated by the mass media. The Commission concurs, therefore, that the condition of Article\n56(4) has been met. The Commission also notes that all the documents submitted by the Complainants\nhave been disclosed to the Respondent State.\n88. The Commission recalls its established jurisprudence whereby the exhaustion of local remedies\nreferred to in Article 56(5) 'entails remedy sought from the courts of a judicial nature.'7 Such a judicial\nremedy shall be effective and shall not be subordinated to the discretionary power of public authorities8 .\nThe Commission has also affirmed on several occasions that it is not necessary, for the sake of meeting\nthe condition of Article 56(5), to seek 'remedies from a source which does not operate impartially and have\nno obligation to decide according to legal principles' 9 .\n89. In the present communication, the victim challenged the decision expelling him from Botswana before\nthe domestic courts. His application before the High Court of Botswana was dismissed, as was a further\nappeal that he filed with the Court of Appeal, the highest judicial authority in Botswana. The Commission\nfinds therefore that all local remedies have been exhausted. The Commission is of the view that the\npresidential review referred to by the Respondent State is not of a judicial nature and is subject to the\ndiscretionary power of the President, the very authority that ordered the expulsion of the victim. The\nCommission considers that such a remedy is not effective and the victim is not obliged to utilise it.\n90. The Commission further finds that the other arguments10 submitted by the State against the\nadmissibility of the communication are based on substantive rights protected under the Charter, including\nthe rights, the violation of which is complained of by the applicant, to such an extent that dealing with them\nat this stage of the procedure would be pushing the Commission to jump the gun to consider the\ncommunication on the merits. The Commission therefore will not pronounce on them but would rather deal\nwith them at the appropriate stage.\n91. From the above submissions, this Commission is of the view that the present communication\nsufficiently complies with the requirements under Article 56, relating to the admissibility of communications\nbefore the African Commission and thus decides to declare the communication admissible.\nMerits\nRespondent State's preliminary objection to the Commission's procedure\n\n92. At the 42nd Ordinary Session of the Commission, the Respondent State raised a preliminary objection\nregarding the Commission's procedure in the handling of complaints/communications. The main thrust of\nthe State's objection is that the Commission's procedure relating to the handling of communications was\nnot followed with regards to the present communication. According to the State, Rule 119 of the\nCommission's Rules of Procedure was not respected, and as a result, both parties to the communication,\nthe Respondent State and the Complainants, made submissions to the Commission at almost the same\n8\n\n\ftime, making it difficult to respond to issues raised by either party.\n93. The Respondent State submits that the Commission had asked both parties to submit their arguments\non the merits, giving both parties the same deadline. Both parties sent their arguments to the Secretariat of\nthe Commission at almost the same time, and the Commission then forwarded the submissions of either\nparty to the other for comments, if any.\n94. The Respondent State contends that this procedure deprives it from properly addressing the issues\nraised by the Complainants as it was not availed a copy of the Complainants' submission prior to the\nRespondent State making its own submission. In the words of the Respondent State \"it prejudices\nBotswana greatly in that the applicant has effectively been afforded an undue opportunity to strengthen his\ncase, to the extent that the submissions filed by him raise very many new matters of fact and law which our\narguments, as is to be expected, do not deal with\". The Respondent State concluded that the\nComplainants' supplementary submissions on the merits be purged off the record.\n95. Referring to Rule 119 of the African Commission's Rules of Procedure, the State maintains that it was\nsupposed to have submitted first and the Complainants given the opportunity to reply within a time fixed by\nthe Commission, in accordance with Rule 119 (3).\n96. The Commission will thus, first deal with the preliminary issue raised by the Respondent State before\nproceeding to make a determination on the merits of the communication.\nAfrican Commission's decision on the preliminary objection\n\n97. In the present communication, after declaring the case admissible at the Commission's 41st Ordinary\nSession, the Secretariat, by Note Verbale of 20th June 2007, and letter of the same date, informed both\nparties and requested them to submit their arguments on the merits within three months from the date of\nnotification. On 5th October 2007, the Secretariat received the Complainants' submissions on the merits of\nthe communication. On 12th October 2007, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submissions on\nthe merits. On 22nd October 2007, the Secretariat forwarded the submissions of the Respondent State to\nthe Complainants, and the Complainants to the Respondent State.\n98. The purpose of requiring parties to make submissions to the Commission is so that they appreciate the\nconcerns of each other and try to address them as best as they can. That is why the Commission adopted\nRules of Procedure governing, among other things, the receipt and consideration of communications.\n99. Rule 119 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure seek to guide the Commission regarding the\nprocedure to adopt after a communication has been declared admissible. In terms of Rule 119 (1) \"if the\nCommission decides that a communication is admissible...its decision and text of the relevant documents\nshall as soon as possible, be submitted to the State Party concerned...The author of the communication\nshall also be informed of the Commission's decision...\". Rule 119 (2) provides further that the State Party\n\"... shall within the ensuing three months, submit in writing to the Commission, ...measures it was able to\ntake to remedy the situation\".\n100. From the above two paragraphs of Rule 119, it is the view of the Commission that when a\ncommunication is declared admissible, both parties must be notified of the decision. While the African\nCharter obliges the Commission to submit its decisions and other relevant texts relating to its decision on\nadmissibility to the State Party, it simply requires the Commission to inform the author of the\ncommunication. This presupposes that the Respondent State is the one that is expected to make\nsubmissions on the merits, to, in the words of the Charter, provide \"explanations or statements elucidating\nthe issue under consideration and indicating, if possible, measures it was able to take to remedy the\nsituation\".\n101. This interpretation is supported when one turns to Rule 119 (3) which provides that 'all explanations or\nstatements submitted by a State Party pursuant to the present Rule shall be communicated... to the author\nof the communication, who may submit in writing additional information and observations within a time limit\nfixed by the Commission'.\n102. It is clear from the above, that after declaring a communication admissible, both parties are informed\nof the decision, but the Respondent State is further requested to make submissions on the matter being\nconsidered. After the State would have submitted, then the submission is availed to the author of the\ncommunication for his/her comments. The Respondent State seems to be satisfied that the Note Verbale of\n20th June inviting it to make submissions on the merits \"was the correct step\".\n103. However, the Respondent State contends that if the Complainants were also invited to make\nsubmissions on the merits \"that was a defective step and clearly the Commission will be guilty of breaking\n9\n\n\fits own procedural rules\".\n104. The procedure of letting one party submit first and inviting the other to respond will give both parties\nthe opportunity to address the issues or concerns of the other. This exchange of submissions between the\nState and the author of the communication can continue until the Commission is satisfied that it has had\nenough information to make a decision on the matter.\n105. The African Commission thus concurs with the Respondent State that when parties are asked to\nsubmit at the same time, it does not give both of them the opportunity to respond to issues that are raised\nby the other party.\n106. This notwithstanding, the practice of the Commission is clear. Where it receives submissions from one\nparty, it sends the same to the other party for their comments. Thus, even if the parties make submissions\nat the same time, the other party is not prejudiced in any way because they are still given an opportunity to\nrespond to the submissions before the Commission can make a determination. This was the situation with\nrespect to the present communication.\n107. The Secretariat received the State's submissions on 12th October 2007 and sent same to the\nComplainants on 22nd October 2007. Thus, the Respondent State was sent the Complainant's submissions\nand the Complainants were sent the State's submissions, and both parties were entitled to send comments,\nif any.\n108. Thus, even though Rule 119 was not followed to the letter, the Respondent State has not indicated\nhow it was prejudiced by this lapse, to the advantage of the Complainants. The Respondent State has been\ngiven an equal opportunity to respond to the submissions of the Complainants just as the Complainants\nhave been given an opportunity to respond to the State's submissions.\n109. The Commission accordingly takes note of the fact that Rule 119 of its Rules of Procedure was not\nfollowed to the letter, and undertakes to ensure that it is complied with in the future. It holds that since the\nRespondent State has been given time to respond to the Complainants' submission, its argument that the\nComplainants' submissions on the matter be purged from the record cannot stand. The African Commission\naccordingly requests both parties to submit their responses, within three months, on the arguments made\nby either party.\n\nComplainants' submissions on the merits\n\n110. The Complainants allege that the existence and application of the Botswana Immigration Act has\nviolated Articles 1, 2, 7(1) (a), 9, 12(4) and 18 of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 1\n\n111. With respect to the alleged violation of Article 1 of the African Charter, Complainants submit that the\nCharter was adopted and acceded to voluntarily by African States and that once ratified, States Parties to\nthe Charter are legally bound by its provisions, adding that States wishing not to be bound ought to have\nrefrained from ratifying.\n112. The Complainants refer to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which states\nthat \"a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith and in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to\nthe terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". The Complainants also\nmake reference to Legal Resources Foundation v Zambia11 where the Commission stated that the African\nCharter must be interpreted holistically and all clauses must reinforce each other. The African Charter must\nalso be interpreted, in light of international norms and consistently with the approach of the other regional\nand international human rights bodies.\n113. The Complainants assert that the fact that the African Charter has not been incorporated into\nBotswana domestic law may preclude persons in Botswana from relying on the provisions of the Charter\nbefore local courts but does not affect recourse to the Commission under the African Charter. States are\nbound by their ratification of the African Charter whether monist or dualist and even where it revokes the\ndomestic effect of the Charter12 . Consequently, they argue, all the provisions of the African Charter\naddressed below indicate the Respondent State's failure to respect the African Charter and to ensure its full\nimplementation in violation of Article 1 of the same.\n\n10\n\n\fAlleged Violation of Articles 7(1)(a)&12(4)\n\n114. The Complainants allege that the victim was deprived by law from accessing information relating to\nthe reasons for his being declared a threat to national security, which in turn denied judicial authorities the\nright to review the President's decisions. Together, these denials, according to the Complainants, amount\nto a clear violation of the right to appeal to competent judicial organs, a situation that affects the right to be\nheard. In this regard, they contend that the right to be heard entails the right to challenge in a court of law,\ndecisions that affect the individual's fundamental rights13 .\n115. Depending on Sections 7(f), 11(6) and 36 of the Botswana Immigration Act, the Complainants aver\nthat the courts that determined the victim's application and appeal prior to and following his expulsion,\nfound that he had no right to any information regarding the President's decision, and that the courts had no\npower to question the reason for his expulsion and that there was no legal limit to the unfettered discretion\nof the President.\n116. According to the Complainants, the victim was not afforded any meaningful opportunity to challenge\nhis expulsion either by way of hearing before the expulsion order was made, or by way of appeal after the\norder was made. He was not provided with the reasons for his expulsion and was accordingly not afforded\nan opportunity to challenge those reasons or provide evidence which might contradict them. He was neither\ngiven any remedy in respect of the violations of his rights. These decisions and the underlying provisions of\nSections 11(6) and 36 of the Immigration Act, according to the Complainants, are inconsistent with basic\nprinciples of due process enshrined in Article 7 of the African Charter.\n117. The Complainants aver that any decision passed \"in accordance with the law\" as provided under\nArticle 12(4) of the African Charter should fulfil the following three requirements: one, it should be provided\nin a clear and accessible law to offer predictability and to guard against arbitrariness; two, it \"...must be\nmade by a court or an administrative authority on the basis of a law affording protection against arbitrary\nexpulsion through the establishment of corresponding procedural guarantees\"14 In relation with this they\nrefer to the Commission's decision in Modise v Botswana15 where the Commission stated that \"in\naccordance with law\" requires not only strict conformity with national law, but also with the principles of the\nAfrican Charter and other international norms. Third, he contends that the procedural guarantees under\nArticle 12(4) enshrine the right to meaningful judicial oversight of administrative decisions.\n118. With regard to the issue of national security, the Complainants submit that while the victim's case\nraises no genuine issue of \"national security\", it is noted that, even where such legitimate concerns do\narise, they do not provide a basis to set aside the rights protected in the African Charter. They argue that\nwhile legitimate security concerns can be taken into account in interpreting the African Charter, they cannot\nerode the essence of the rights protected, including the right protected under Article 12(4). The\nComplainants refer to Commission nationale des droits de l'Homme et des libertés v Chad16 where the\nCommission stated that the African Charter does not allow States Parties to derogate from their treaty\nobligations even during emergency situations. They also refer to Amnesty International v Zambia17 where\nthe Commission found a violation of Article 12(4) where the national court did not consider Zambia's\nobligations under the African Charter and failed to rule on the ground that the Complainant was likely to\n\"endanger peace and good order in Zambia\". According to the Commission, \"there was no judicial inquiry\non the basis in law and in terms of administrative justice for relying on this 'opinion' of the Minister of Home\nAffairs for the action taken\".\n119. The Complainants contend that the President did not give reasons for the victim's deportation, neither\ndid he explain or justify his decision and considerations of national security. The President, according to the\nComplainants, applied a law which afforded him an apparently limitless power to make a declaration which\nhas the effect of causing an individual to become [[span class=\"JQ-quotes\"]]\"a prohibited immigrant\". This\npower is attended by a blanket denial of information as to the basis for its exercise. A law of this breadth\nand potentially all encompassing scope, the Complainants argue, lacks the clarity and precision required of\n>\n\n11\n\n\f","template":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a930807a3a2","metadata":{"country":"","mechanism":"","type_of_document":"","language":"","date":"","keywords":"","activity_report":"","outcome":""}},{"_id":"f2cb1f37c9ac9095ca5f14426305eaaf","title":"Tsatsu Tsikata  Ghana","type":"document","user":{"_id":"c08ef2532f0bd008ac5174b45e033c93","_rev":"4-59cf1b25af945b4012dcad00e22ae49a","type":"user","username":"admin"},"creationDate":1464788927206,"file":{"fieldname":"file","originalname":"322_06 Tsatsu Tsikata _ Ghana.pdf","encoding":"7bit","mimetype":"application/pdf","destination":"/home/deploys/demo/app/api/upload/../../../uploaded_documents/","filename":"1464788929372mwvaqh3596civn29.pdf","path":"/home/deploys/demo/uploaded_documents/1464788929372mwvaqh3596civn29.pdf","size":28335},"uploaded":true,"processed":true,"fullText":"322/06 Tsatsu Tsikata / Ghana\nSummary of Facts\n1. The Secretariat of the African Commission received the communication from the Complainant, Redmond\nTsatsu Tsikata, in accordance with Article 55 of the African Charter.\n2. The author of the present communication, who is himself the Complainant, submitted the communication\nagainst the Republic of Ghana ('Ghana')1 , alleging that the latter is in the process of trying him for \"wilfully\ncausing financial loss to the State\" contrary to Section 179A (3) of the Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29); an act,\nwhich did not constitute an offence at the time of the commission. He alleges that this is contrary to Article\n19(5)\n× A person shall not be charged with or held to be guilty of a criminal offence which is founded on an act or\nomission that did not at the time it took place constitute an offence.\n(http://www.parliament.gh/chapter_five_-_fundamental_human_right_and_freedoms.html Accessed\n18.10.2010)\nof the Constitution of Ghana, which prohibits retroactive criminalisation, and Article 7(2) of the African\nCharter. He had challenged this in the High Court in Ghana, and his contention was upheld.\n3. He further alleges that in the course of his trial, he has been denied the right to a fair trial, in violation of\nArticle 7(1) of the African Charter. He alleged that he had been summoned 'in the name of the President' to\nappear before a 'Fast-Track Court'; and he had challenged the constitutionality of both at the Supreme\nCourt, which claims were upheld on 28th February 2002. However, after the Executive's alleged\ninterference with the decision, and the 'questionable' appointment of a new Justice of the Supreme Court,\nthe decision was 'reversed' by an 11-member panel of the Supreme Court, including the newly-appointed\nJustice, on 26th June 2002. The case was further 'remitted' to the 'Fast-Track Court', which had now been\ndeclared constitutional.\n4. The author also notes that the Chief Justice had prior to the Supreme Court's latter decision, publicly and\nexplicitly stated his determination to have the earlier decision of the case reversed.\n5. The author also contends that both the manner of appointment of the new Justice of the Supreme Court\nand the conduct of the Executive towards the Judiciary in relation to his case constituted a violation of\nArticle 26 of the African Charter, which obliges states to guarantee the independence of the judiciary.\n6. The author stated that on 9th October 2002, he was again charged before the High Court of Accra on\nfour counts, including the retroactive charge of 'wilfully causing financial loss to the State' (para. 2 above);\nand intentionally misapplying public property contrary to section 1(2) of the Public Property Decree 1977,\n(SMCD 140). He alleges that the facts on which the charges were based are the same as those on which\nhe had been charged before three (3) previous courts: a) Circuit Tribunal; b) Fast Track Court; and c) the\nnormal High Court.\n7. The author further alleges a violation of his right to fair trial under Article 7(1) of the African Charter when\nthe trial judge of the High Court of Accra overruled his Counsel's submission of 'no-case-to-answer', without\ngiving reasons; thereby violating his right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court\nor tribunal, as well as right to have the violations of his fundamental rights redressed.\n8. He further alleges that he had appealed to the Court of Appeal, and that in upholding the decision of the\nlower court, the Court of Appeal had relied on a repealed law, which was neither cited in the charge sheet,\nnor at any point in the trial proceedings at the High Court, except in response to the submission of\n'no-case-to-answer'. He alleges that the Court of Appeal thereby denied him of his right to defence\nguaranteed under Article 7(1)(c) of the African Charter as he could not have known before the trial, that a\nrepealed law, which he had no (prior) notice of in the charge sheet or at any point in the trial, would be the\nbasis of his charge. He also alleges a further breach of his right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty\nby a competent court or tribunal guaranteed by Article 7(1)(b) of the African Charter.\n9. He submits that there is a further violation of Article 7(2) of the African Charter, and a failure to enforce\nArticles 19(5)\n× A person shall not be charged with or held to be guilty of a criminal offence which is founded on an act or\nomission that did not at the time it took place constitute an offence.\n(http://www.parliament.gh/chapter_five_-_fundamental_human_right_and_freedoms.html Accessed\n18.10.2010)\n\n1\n\n\fand Article 11 of the Constitution of Ghana, which accord him certain fundamental rights as an accused\nperson.\n10. He contends that he was further denied the right to defence guaranteed under Article 7(1)(c) of the\nAfrican Charter when upon his subpoena, the counsel for the International Finance Commission (IFC)\nappeared before the Court and argued that the IFC was immune from the court's jurisdiction; and this\nargument was upheld, even by the Court of Appeal, despite the provision of Article 19(2)(g)\n× A person charged with a criminal offence shall:- be afforded facilities to examine, in person or by his\nlawyer, the witnesses called by the prosecution before the court, and to obtain the attendance and carry out\nthe examination of witnesses to testify on the same conditions as those applicable to witnesses called by\nthe prosecution. (http://www.parliament.gh/chapter_five_-_fundamental_human_right_and_freedoms.html\nAccessed 19.10.2010)\nof the Constitution of Ghana, which guarantees the accused's right to call witnesses, and the fact that the\nstatutory provisions on the IFC in Ghana do not grant them the claimed immunity from testifying.\n11. He noted that Article 19(2)(g)\n× A person charged with a criminal offence shall: - be afforded facilities to examine, in person or by his\nlawyer, the witnesses called by the prosecution before the court, and to obtain the attendance and carry out\nthe examination of witnesses to testify on the same conditions as those applicable to witnesses called by\nthe prosecution. (http://www.parliament.gh/chapter_five_-_fundamental_human_right_and_freedoms.html\nAccessed 19.10.2010)\nof the Constitution of Ghana is similar to the paragraph 2 (e)(iii)\n× Examine or have examined, the witnesses against them and to obtain the attendance and examination of\nwitnesses on their behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against them\nof the provisions of the Resolution on the Right to Recourse and Fair Trial of the African Commission on\nHuman and Peoples' Rights' meeting at its 11th Ordinary Session in Tunisia, 2nd to 9th May 1992.\n12. Lastly, he contended that the continuation of his trial on charges and in the manner that offend the\nprovisions of the African Charter would cause him irreparable damage.\n\nComplaint\n13. The author of this communication contends that the charge on which his trial is based constitutes a\nviolation of the right against non-retroactive criminalisation under Article 7(2) of the African Charter.\n14. He also contends that the manners in which the trial has been, and is being carried out violate Article\n7(1) of the African Charter.\n15. He seeks the intervention of the African Commission, and urges the [African] Commission to invoke\nRule 111 of its Rules of Procedure on provisional measures, and request the Republic of Ghana not to\nproceed further with his trial until his case has been heard by the African Commission.\n\nProcedure\n16. The present communication was received by the Secretariat of the African Commission on 27th April\n2006.\n17. The Secretariat of the [African] Commission acknowledged receipt of the communication to the\ncomplainant under letter ACHPR/LPROT/COMM/322/2006/RE of 2nd May 2006, providing the references of\nthe communication and informing the complainant that the communication would be scheduled for\nconsideration by the African Commission at its 39th Ordinary Session to be held in May 2006, in Banjul, The\nGambia.\n18. At its 39th Ordinary Session, held from 11th to 25th May 2006, in Banjul, The Gambia, the Commission\ndecided to be seized of the communication, but declined to request the Respondent State to take\nprovisional measures in accordance with Rule 111(1) of its Rules of Procedure because the Complainant\ndid not demonstrate the irreparable damage that would be caused if the provisional measures were not\ntaken.\n19. On 1st June 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission informed the parties of the\nabove-mentioned decision and asked them to provide it with more information on the admissibility of the\ncommunication, in accordance with Article 56 of the African Charter. It also sent a copy of the\ncommunication to the Respondent State. It requested the parties to send their written observations to the\nSecretariat within three (3) months after notification of the decision.\n2\n\n\f20. On 31st August and 5th September 2006, the Secretariat of the [African] Commission received the\nsubmissions of the Respondent State by fax and mail, respectively.\n21. At its 40th Ordinary Session held from 15th to 29th November 2006 in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission considered this communication on admissibility.\n\nLaw\nAdmissibility\nThe Complainant's submission\n\n22. In the case under consideration, the Complainant makes reference to several recourses to the domestic\ncourts for redress of the alleged violations of his rights, but gives no indication of the exhaustion of all\navailable domestic remedies, particularly in view of the alleged on-going violation. From the facts\npresented, the alleged on-going violation of his rights involves an on-going trial, the legality of which he\nchallenges on the basis of the provisions of the Charter. He however failed to present evidence of the\nconclusion of this trial, and or to prove that it has been unduly prolonged.\n23. The Complainant contended that the continuation of his trial based on charges and in the manner that\noffend the provisions of the African Charter would cause him irreparable damage, but without elaborating\nhow.\nThe Respondent State's submission\n\n24. In its response in accordance with Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission, the\nRespondent State referred to the provisions of Article 56(5) of the African Charter which provides for the\nexhaustion of local remedies as a requirement for the African Commission to rule on the admissibility of\ncommunications, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged. It therefore submitted that\nsince the matter of the Complainant's communication is still pending in the High Court of Justice, Ghana,\nwith further unexplored rights of appeal to the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of Ghana, in accordance\nwith Articles 137\n× (1) The Court of Appeal shall have jurisdiction throughout Ghana to hear and determine, subject to the\nprovisions of this Constitution, appeals from a judgement, decree or order of the High Court and Regional\nTribunals and such other appellate jurisdiction as may be conferred on it by this Constitution or any other\nlaw. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, an appeal shall lie as of right from a judgement,\ndecree or order of the High Court and a Regional Tribunal to the Court of Appeal. (3) For the purposes of\nhearing and determining an appeal within its jurisdiction and the amendment, execution or the enforcement\nof a judgment or order made on any appeal, and, for the purposes of any other authority expressly or by\nnecessary implication given to the Court of Appeal by this Constitution or any other law, the Court of Appeal\nshall have all the powers, authority and jurisdiction vested in the court from which the appeal is brought.\nand 131\n× (1) An appeal shall lie from a judgement of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court- (a) as of right in a\ncivil or criminal cause or matter in respect of which an appeal has been brought to the Court of Appeal from\na judgment of the High Court or a Regional Tribunal in the exercise of its original jurisdiction; or (b) with the\nleave of the Court of Appeal, in any other cause or matter, where the case was commenced in a court\nlower than the High Court or a Regional Tribunal and where the Court of Appeal is satisfied that the case\ninvolves a substantial question of law or is in the public interest. (2) Notwithstanding clause (1) of this\narticle, the Supreme Court may entertain application for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in\nany cause or matter, civil or criminal, and may grant leave accordingly. (3) The Supreme Court shall have\nappellate jurisdiction, to the exclusion of the Court of Appeal, to determine matters relating to the conviction\nor otherwise of a person for high treason or treason by the High Court. (4) An appeal from a decision of the\nJudicial Committee of the National House of Chiefs shall lie to the Supreme Court with the leave of that\nJudicial Committee or the Supreme Court.\nrespectively of the Constitution of Ghana, the communication should be declared inadmissible by the\n[African] Commission.\n\n3\n\n\f25. The Respondent State also recalled that the guidelines for submission of communications provide that\neach communication should particularly indicate that local remedies have been exhausted, and observed\nthat the Complainant failed to provide any evidence of the domestic legal remedies pursued.\n26. The Respondent State also argued that the Complainant further failed to meet the requirement of\nArticle 56(5) of the [African] Charter as he could not show in his complaint that the procedure in the High\nCourt of Justice has been protracted or unduly delayed. It further submitted that if indeed any delay has\nbeen occasioned, it would be due to the Complainant's own repeated requests for adjournments and\ninterlocutory appeals.\n27. The Respondent State also made reference to Article 56(5) of the [African] Charter, which provides for\ncommunications to be submitted \"within a reasonable period from the time local remedies are\nexhausted...\", and submitted that the Complainant acted impetuously given that the matter has not been\nconcluded, and time has not begun to run so as to afford the Complainant an opportunity to bring his\ncomplaint.\n28. Furthermore, the Respondent State noted Article 56(3) of the [African] Charter and the guidelines for\nsubmission of communications which provide that a communication shall be considered \"if it is not written in\ndisparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned...\"; and submitted that the language\nin paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of the Complainant's communication is insulting to Ghana and its judiciary\nwhere lack of integrity, impropriety, bias and prejudice are imputed to the Executive and the Judiciary of the\nRepublic of Ghana. To this effect, the Respondent State cited the Complainant's statement in paragraph 17\nof his communication whereby he stated that: \"far from guaranteeing the independence of the court in\nrelation to my trial, the Government of Ghana has shown an irrevocable determination to have me found\nguilty by hook or crook and incarcerated\".\n\nThe Commission's Decision\n29. The admissibility of the communications submitted before the African Commission is governed by the\nseven conditions set out in Article 56 of the African Charter.\n30. The parties' submissions only relate to the provisions of Articles 56(3), 56(5) and 56(6).\n31. Article 56(3) specifically stipulates that communications shall be considered if they \"are not written in\ndisparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned and its institutions...\".\n32. In respect of the Respondent's State's submission that paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of the complaint is\nwritten in disparaging or insulting language directed against the former, the [African] Commission holds that\nthis is not the case. The [African] Commission notes that these stipulated paragraphs of the complaint are\nonly facts of allegations of Charter violations; and expressions of the Complainant's fear in this regard. It is\non the basis of these allegations and fear that the Complainant had submitted this communication. The\n[African] Commission reiterates that the purpose of its mandate is to consider complaints alleging such\nperceived judicial bias and prejudice, and undue interference by the executive with judicial independence,\nin accordance with Article 7 of the [African] Charter, its Resolution on the Respect and the Strengthening\non the Independence of the Judiciary (1996) 2 , and other relevant international human rights norms; in\naccordance with Articles 60, 61 of the [African] Charter.\n33. In this light, the [African] Commission wishes to distinguish these paragraphs, for instance, from its\ndecision in the case of communication 65/92 Ligue Camerounaise des Droits de l'Homme/Cameroon,\nwhere the [African] Commission condemned the use of words such as \"Paul Biya must resond [sic] to\ncrimes against humanity\"; \"30 years of the criminal neo-colonial regime incarnated by the duo Ahidjio/Biya\";\n\"regime of torturers\"; and \"government barbarisms\", as insulting language.\n34. In respect of Article 56(5) which stipulates that communications shall be considered if they \"are sent\nafter exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged...\", the\n[African] Commission notes the importance of this rule as a condition for the admissibility of a claim before\nan international forum. It notes that the rule is based on the premise that the Respondent State must first\nhave an opportunity to redress by its own means and within the framework of its own domestic legal\nsystem, the wrong alleged to have been done to the individual.\n35. In light of the parties' submissions, the African Commission notes that the complainant's allegations are\nin respect of an on-going/unconcluded trial. The information provided by the complainant himself states that\nthe communication [sic] is still pending before the courts of the Republic of Ghana. The [African]\nCommission further notes that should the on-going trial end against the Complainant's favour, he has\nfurther rights of appeal to the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of Ghana, in accordance with Articles\n4\n\n\f137 and 131 respectively of the Constitution of Ghana. In this regard, the [African] Commission draws the\nattention of the parties to the similar case of communication 135/94 Kenya Human Rights Commission /\nKenya, where it had held that \"...the facts supplied by the Complainants themselves stated that the\ncommunication was pending before the Courts of Kenya,... [and] that the Complainants had therefore not\nexhausted all available local remedies\".\n36. Therefore, although the communication presents a prima facie case of a series of violations of the\nAfrican Charter, a close look at the file and the submissions indicate that the complainant is yet to exhaust\nall the local remedies available to him.\n37. With regard to Article 56(6) of the [African] Charter which provides that communications shall be\nconsidered if \"... they are submitted within a reasonable period of time from the time local remedies are\nexhausted, or from the date the Commission is seized of the matter\", the [African] Commission holds that\nthis is quite related to the principle of the exhaustion of local remedies in accordance with Article 56(5). This\nmeans that the Commission estimates the timeliness of a communication from the date that the last\navailable local remedy is exhausted by the Complainant. In the case of unavailability or prolongation of\nlocal remedies, it will be from the date of the Complainant's notice thereof.\n38. Unlike its Inter-American3 contemporary, the Commission does not specify a time-period within which\ncommunications must be submitted. However, it advised on the early submission of communications in the\ncase of communication 97/93 John K. Modise/Botswana.\n39. However, having found that the Complainant has not exhausted local remedies the [African]\nCommission concurs with the Respondent State's argument that the Complainant had acted impetuously in\nbringing this communication.

The Complaint is brought by the Front for the Liberation of the State of Cabinda - FLEC (the\nComplainant) on behalf of the people of Cabinda (Victims) against the Republic of Angola1 (the\nRespondent State or Angola).\n2. The Complainant submits that Cabinda, formerly known as the Portuguese Congo, consists of a territory\nof approximately 2800 square miles. The Complainant further submits that in 1885 the independent rulers\nof Cabinda city and its environs entered into a treaty, the Treaty of Simulambuco, with the Government of\nthe Kingdom of Portugal establishing a Protectorate over much of present day Cabinda.\n3. In 1975, the Complainant alleges, the Alvor Conference in Portugal, between the colonial power and\nUNITA, MPLA, and FNLA (all of which were liberation movements) declared the annexation of Cabinda by\nAngola without any Cabindan participation. Following this event, Angola has exercised sovereignty over\nCabinda despite protestations by the people of Cabinda, through groups dedicated to the idea of a distinct\nidentity for the people of Cabinda.\n4. The Complainant alleges that since 2002, following attempts by groups in Cabinda to stake a claim to\nautonomy for the people of Cabinda, the Respondent State has undertaken a massive military campaign\nagainst Cabinda and that when this failed, the state entered into ad hoc negotiations with Cabindan factions\nin an attempt to confuse issues. These negotiations, the Complainant alleges, excluded the Chairman of\nFLEC, Mr. Nzita Tiago - \"the only universally recognized Cabindan authority\" - and resulted in a 2006\nPeace Accord that was contested by both Cabinda and the democratic opposition in Angola, the UNITA.\n5. The Complainant further alleges that following the rejection of the 2006 Peace Accord by the majority of\nCabindans, fractions in Cabinda continued to demand local autonomy over the wealth of Cabinda. The\nComplainant states that the Respondent State has responded to the demands by maintaining a large\nmilitary force in Cabinda, which has committed numerous documented human rights violations therein.2\n6. The Complainant claims that in 2006 the Angolan Forces (FAA) committed dozens of human rights and\nhumanitarian violations such as: the bombardment of civilian dwellings in the Mayombe (Piading) region;\nsummary execution of Cabinda patriots in Buco, Zao and beatings and torture of Mpalabanda members in\nCaio Poba.\n7. It is the Complainant further claim that in July 2006 Angola banned the only independent human rights\norganization in Cabinda, Mpalabnda (Associacao Civica de Cabinda) through the instrumentality of a court\norder, allegedly for inciting violence and hatred, and carrying out political activities rather than being a civil\nsociety organization.\n8. Furthermore, the Complainant avers, Government of the Respondent State is exercising economic\nexploitation of Cabindan resources since the people of Cabinda are not allowed to have any say in the\ngrant of licences and concessions over their resources. The Complainant claims that the people of Cabinda\nhave been suffering comparatively higher unemployment, lack of educational opportunities, disease and\nintense poverty since the Government of the Respondent State took over Cabinda's natural resources such\nas offshore oil, onshore mineral and oil resources.\n9. The Complainant further alleges that the Government of the Respondent State has economically\ndominated the Cabindan people by denying them their status as a people and by extracting more than\nninety per cent (90%) of their economic patrimony while returning less than ten per cent (10%) to Cabinda.\nBy this act, the Complainant alleges, the Respondent State has perpetrated neo-colonialism.\n10. The Complainant also contends that although Cabindans are culturally and linguistically separate from\nAngola and have overwhelmingly identified themselves as 'Cabindans', not Angolans, the people of\nCabinda have been denied their right to self-determination by Angola.\n11. The Complainant submits that despite over 30 years of conflict over the status of Cabinda, the\nRespondent State has refused to hold a referendum on the issue of Cabindan question. The Complainant\nalleges that the Respondent State does not permit Cabinda to determine its own economic and social\ndevelopment. The Complainant states that all economic decisions are made in Luanda, the capital city of\nthe Respondent State and not in Cabinda, even though Cabinda has maintained a government in exile\nsince 1963 and has had an active self-defence force and civil administration inside Cabinda since 1975.\n1\n\n\fArticles alleged to have been violated\n12. The Complainant alleges that in relation to the people of Cabinda, the Respondent State has violated\nArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter.\nPrayers of the Complainant\n13. The Complainant requests the African Commission on Human and Peoples Right (African Commission\nor Commission):\n1. To appoint a Special Rapporteur to undertake fact finding and make recommendations on the\nissues it has raised.\n2. Make its good offices available for further engagement on the issues raised\n3. Award $US 50000 against the Respondent State to cover the Complainant's legal fees and costs.\n\nProcedure\n14. This Communication was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on Human and\nPeoples' Rights (the Secretariat) on 29 September 2006. The Secretariat acknowledged receipt by letter\ndated 2 October 2006, informing the Complainant that the Communication would be scheduled for\nconsideration on seizure by the African Commission at its 40th Ordinary Session held in November 2006 in\nBanjul, The Gambia.\n15. At its 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul, The Gambia, the African\nCommission decided to be seized of the Communication.\n16. On 8 January 2007, the African Commission further received a press statement issued by FLEC on the\ncurrent struggle for the control of petroleum in Cabinda, alleging continuous violations of the African\nCharter by the Angolan Government and other actors for which the State is responsible.\n17. By a letter dated 8 February 2007 and Note Verbale dated 28 February 2007, the Secretariat informed\nthe Parties of the Commission's decision on seizure and requested the Parties to submit their arguments on\nthe Admissibility of the Communication within two months. A copy of the Complaint was also transmitted to\nthe Respondent State.\n18. On 25 April 2007, the Secretariat sent reminders to the Parties to submit their arguments on\nAdmissibility by 10 May 2007 in time for the 41st Session of the African Commission. At its 41st Ordinary\nSession in May 2007 in Accra, Ghana, the Commission considered the Communication and deferred it\npending the receipt of Arguments on Admissibility from the Parties. The Parties were notified accordingly\non 20 June 2007.\n19. On 15 August 2007, the Complainant's brief with its Arguments on Admissibility and an updated\nstatement of facts was received at the Secretariat. These were transmitted along with a Note Verbale to the\nRespondent State on 20 August 2007 together with a request for the latter to submit its response to the\nComplainant's submission on Admissibility.\n20. During its 42nd Ordinary Session in November 2007, the African Commission considered the\nCommunication and decided to give the Respondent State one last chance to make its submissions on the\nAdmissibility of the Communication. The Parties were notified accordingly on 19 December 2007.\n21. During its 43rd and 44th Ordinary Sessions, the African Commission deferred the consideration of the\nCommunication pending the submission on Admissibility by the Respondent State, the parties were\naccordingly informed.\n22. On 27 April 2009 the Secretariat sent a reminder to the Respondent State to make its submissions on\nAdmissibility.\n23. On 21 July 2009, the African Commission received supplementary information to the Communication by\nthe Complainant.\n24. During its 45th and 46th Ordinary Sessions respectively, the African Commission considered the\nCommunication and deferred its decision on Admissibility pending the Respondent State's submission on\nAdmissibility\n2\n\n\f25. On 12 January 2010, the Secretariat received a letter from the Complainant urging the African\nCommission to take immediate action and to appoint a Special Rapporteur for Cabinda.\n26. During its 47th, 48th, 49th and 50th Ordinary Sessions, the African Commission deferred the\nconsideration of the Communication, and the Parties were accordingly informed. At its 10th Extraordinary\nSession held in December 2011, the Commission considered the Communication and declared it\nAdmissible. The Parties were accordingly informed and invited to submit their Arguments on the Merit.\n27. Between January and March 2012, the Secretariat received submissions from three different\norganisations representing different groups in Cabinda (joint submission by the Front de Liberation de\nL'Etat du Cabinda (FLEC) et Union Nationale de Liberation du Cabinda (UNLC), and individual submissions\nby the \"Original FLEC\" and the Mouvement Pour Le Rassemblement Du Peuple Cabindais et Pour Sa\nSouverainete \"MRPCS). On 29 March 2012, the Secretariat received a Submission on the Merit from Dr\nJonathan Levy acting in his capacity as legal representative of the Complainant.3 The Complainant's\nSubmission on the Merit was accordingly transmitted to the Respondent State.\n28. On 24 April 2012, the Respondent State's Note Verbale forwarding the latter's Arguments on the Merit\nwas received at the Secretariat and transmitted to Complainant through its legal representative.\n29. On 12 July 2012, the Complainant through its legal representative forwarded its Supplementary\nSubmission on the Merit. On 10, 12 and 28 September 2012, the Secretariat received the same copy of an\nupdated and amended Submission on the Merit from the Respondent State.\n30. On 18 June 2013, the Secretariat received additional Submissions from the \"Collectif des organisations\ncabindaises\" also known as the \"Original FLEC\". This submission was followed by a letter protesting\nnotification that the submission has been made out of time and a request for reopening of the procedure for\nsubmission of additional documents by both parties.\n31. At its 54th Ordinary Session held in Banjul, The Gambia in October 2013, the Commission considered\nthe Communication on the Merit based on all the documents submitted by the Parties and the various\nAmicus briefs.\n\nThe Law\nAdmissibility\nSubmission of the Complainant on Admissibility\n\n32. Although the Complainant submitted its written arguments on the admissibility of the Communication,\nthe Respondent State failed to submit any arguments on the admissibility of the Communication despite an\ninvitation and repeated reminders to do so. Accordingly, the Commission addresses the question of\nAdmissibility on the basis of the Complainant's arguments on Admissibility.\n33. The Complainant submits that the Communication meets all the Admissibility requirements set out in\nArticle 56 of the African Charter. Regarding Article 56 (1) of the African Charter, the Complainant avers that\nthe Communication is submitted by FLEC on behalf of the people of Cabinda.\n34. Concerning Article 56 (2) of Charter, the Complainant submits that the Respondent State has violated\nArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter. The Complainant further submits that although the\nCommunication alleges serious violations of the economic and peoples\" rights of the people of Cabinda by\nthe Government of Angola, the Complainant does not request the African Commission to take up any\nmatter that would interfere with the sovereignty of Angola or adjudication of Angolan territorial claims in\nCabinda. The Complainant states that they are mindful that the African Commission must respect Articles\n3(b) and 4(b) of the AU Constitutive Act regarding territorial sovereignty and respecting existing borders.\n35. With regards to Article 56 (3) of the African Charter, the Complainant avers that the language used in\nthe Communication is neutral legal language. In relation to Article 56 (4) of the African Charter, the\nComplainant submits that the Communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated through the\nmass media, but rather on primary information provided by FLEC and other organizations directly involved\nin the matter.\n36. On the requirement of the exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56 (5) of the African Charter, the\nComplainant requests the Commission to wave this condition on the basis that exhaustion of domestic\nremedies is futile and legally impossible on the grounds that there is unrest and armed conflict involving the\nParties and this creates difficulties for the commencement of legal proceedings by the Complainant. The\nComplainant avers further that the only independent civil society organisation which could have brought a\n3\n\n\flegal action on behalf of the Complainant has been disbanded and banned by judicial order instigated by\nthe Respondent State. It is also the Complainant's submission that it cannot pursue legal action in the\nRespondent State because it (the Complainant) has been branded a terrorist organisation since the signing\nof a 2006 Peace Accord between the Respondent States and elements in Cabinda.\n37. As to Article 56 (6) of the African Charter, the Complainants aver that the Communication has been\nsubmitted in a timely manner. Lastly, the Complainant submits that the Communication complies with the\nrequirement of Article 56 (7) of the African Charter because the Communication does not deal with a case\nwhich has been settled by the Respondent State.\nThe Commission's Analysis on Admissibility\n\n38. Article 56 of the African Charter lists seven Admissibility requirements that have to be cumulatively\nfulfilled for a Communication to be declared Admissible. In the present Communication, while the\nComplainant has clearly stated its arguments as to why the Communication meets each of the seven\nrequirements stipulated under Article 56, the Respondent State has not made any submission to contest or\nrefute those claims.\n39. From the time when the African Commission was seized with the Communication during its 40th\nOrdinary Session in November 2006 to date, ten (10) reminders were sent to the Respondent State\nrequesting the latter to submit its arguments on Admissibility to no avail.4\n40. As the African Commission has stated in the case of the Institute for Human Rights and Development in\nAfrica v. Republic of Angola5 \"in the face of the state's failure to address itself to the complaint filed against\nit, the African Commission has no option but to proceed with its consideration of the Communication in\naccordance with its Rules of Procedure.\" In the same decision, the African Commission re-affirmed its\nposition by ruling that \"... it would proceed to consider Communications on the basis of the submission of\nthe Complainants and information at its disposal, even if the State fails to submit.\"6\n41. In the case at hand, the Complainant submits that the Communication complies with all the seven\nrequirements of Article 56 of the African Charter, except the one relating to the exhaustion of local\nremedies under Article 56 (5), for which the Complainant asks for waiver.\n42. In the absence of any submissions from the Respondent State to the contrary, the African Commission\nhas considered the Complainant's Submission and is convinced that all the requirements under Article 56,\nexcept Article 56(5) are met. The Commission proceeds to consider the legitimacy of the request for waiver\nbased on Article 56(5) of the Charter and relevant jurisprudence.\n43. Article 56(5) of the African Charter provides that Communications should be \"sent after exhausting local\nremedies, if any, unless it is obvious that this procedure is unduly prolonged\". This requirement is based on\nthe principle that \"the respondent state must first have an opportunity to redress by its own means within\nthe framework of its own domestic legal system, the wrong alleged to have been done to the individual\".7\n44. The Commission has stressed that the requirement of the exhaustion of local remedies \"does not mean\nthat complainants are required to exhaust any local remedy which is found to be, as a practical matter,\nunavailable or ineffective.\"8 The jurisprudence of the Commission, in determining compliance with this\nrequirement, sets out \"[t]hree major criteria, that is: the local remedy must be available, effective and\nsufficient.\"9\n45. The initial burden is on the Complainant to prove that they have met the requirement set in Article 56\n(5) or that those remedies are unavailable in the particular case. Thereafter, the burden shifts to the\nRespondent State if it contests the allegations of the former.\n46. In the present case, the Complainant avers that it has no legal standing under Angolan law and its\nrepresentatives would face arrest and possible execution under Angolan national security laws if they try to\npursue legal remedies in Angola, adding that members of FLEC are considered terrorists in Angolan\nterritory and hence any attempt to take the case before Angolan courts would be futile, if not impossible,\nand would subject members of the Complainant organisation to arbitrary arrest, detention or execution as\nterrorists.\n47. The Complainant also submits that the only independent human rights organisation in Cabinda,\nMpalabanda, that could have taken their case before a court of law was banned on 20 July 2006 for\nallegedly inciting violence and hatred, and being involved in political activities. Furthermore, the\nComplainant argues that the principal members of FLEC (the Complainant) are outside Angolan\njurisdiction, thus they request for the waiver of the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies.\n48. These claims, which are not contested by the Respondent State, show the apparent existence of fear of\n4\n\n\fpersecution on the part of the Complainant.\n49. In a number of cases the African Commission has used the standard of constructive exhaustion of local\nremedies to provide an exception to the rule. Fear of persecution is one of the exceptions to the\nrequirement of exhaustion of local remedies. In Sir Dawda K Jawara v The Gambia10 the African\nCommission reasoned that \"the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but\nalso in practice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Therefore, if the\napplicant cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of generalised fear for his life (or even those of\nhis relatives), local remedies would be considered to be unavailable to him\".\n50. In Rights International v Nigeria11 and John D Ouoko v Kenya12 , the African Commission reasoned that\nthe existence of apparent fear of persecution on the part of the victims, to return to their countries to\nexhaust local remedies would make the remedies not available to such persons and hence exempt them\nfrom the requirement to exhaust those remedies.\n51. In the present Communication, the fact that the Complainant has no legal standing before Angolan\ncourts, that most of its members live abroad and are considered terrorists by the Government, leads to the\nconclusion that the chances of the Complainant exhausting local remedies have been practically rendered\nimpossible by fear of prosecution.\n52. Therefore, the African Commission holds that local remedies were not available to the Complainant and\nhence rules that the Communication is in line with the requirement under Article 56(5) of the African\nCharter.\n53. For the above reasons, the African Commission declares the Communication admissible in accordance\nwith Article 56 of the African Charter.\nConsideration of the Merits\nSummary of Complaint's Submission\n\n54. The Complainant emphasises that the present Communication concerns itself strictly with a claim for\neconomic self-determination of the people of Cabinda and in particular with the disposition and exploitation\nof onshore oil, mineral and natural resources.\n55. The Complainant states further that the Communication excludes the matter of offshore resource\nallocation and relates only to the extraction of onshore resources which has remained dormant due largely\nto FLEC's armed opposition to any such exploitation. The Complainant contends that it does not recognise\ngrants of resource extraction licences and concessions made by the Respondent State and asserts that it\nreserves the right to make its own arrangements with resource extraction companies upon the\n\"decolonisation\" of Cabinda.\n56. Based on its contention that it has been recognised as the legitimate representative of the Cabinda\npeople since 1974, the Complainant requests that the Commission to appoint a Special Rapporteur on the\nissue of Cabinda's economic self-determination on the grounds that the Respondent State has violated\nArticles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the African Charter.\n57. The Complainant argues that as an incident of the right to property under Article 14 of the African\nCharter, the natural resources of Cabinda remain the property of the people of Cabinda and must be\nadministered largely for the benefit of the people of Cabinda. Accordingly, the grant of licences and\nconcession for the extraction of onshore natural resources by the Respondent State is a violation of Article\n14 of the African Charter.\n58. It is the further contention of the Complainant that although a state can grant resource extraction rights\nin the name of its people, a grant made in cases where one people dominate another or a grant made or\nadministered in an irresponsible manner would be illegitimate. The Complainant argues that historically,\nCabinda has always maintained a separate identity, linguistically and otherwise, and the people of Cabinda\nwere neither consulted on the 'unilateral termination of Portuguese colonial protectorate' nor did they ratify\n'the Angolan occupation' of Cabinda.\n59. The Complainant states that since 1974 it has 'maintained a civil government inside portions of\nCabinda' and many of the areas of resource extraction 'are in or near the FLEC zone'. Further, that since\nthe people of Cabinda are distinct, the Respondent State is not entitled to unilaterally grant resource\nextraction licences or concessions in violation of the right to property of the people of Cabinda as contained\nin Article 14 of the African Charter.\n60. In relation to the alleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter, the Complainant contends that\n5\n\n\f'revenue from onshore resource extraction will flow to Luanda just as offshore revenue does now'. The\nComplainant argues that a 2006 Cabinda Peace Accord which promised a 50% return of oil revenue to\nCabinda 'has not been realised or audited' and only '10% or less will return to Cabinda'. The Complainant\nalleges further that any attempt to question the allocation of revenue has resulted in summary\nimprisonment 'as in the case of Global Witness Investigatory' staff who was arrested and charged by\nAngolan Police after meeting with local representatives of civil society in Cabinda.\n61. The Complainant alleges further that in spite of the abundant oil resources in Cabinda unemployment is\nhigh and poverty, infant mortality and disease are higher in Cabinda than in most areas of Angola. The\nComplainant adds that Cabinda's resources have 'subsidised the government of Angola' and the 'Angolan\nadministration has little concern for providing public goods and incentives to facilitate investment in welfare\nenhancing improvements for the population at large'. Thus, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent\nState has violated Article 19 of the African Charter.\n62. Regarding the alleged violation of Article 20 of the Charter, the Complainant emphasises that the\npeople of Cabinda are geographically, politically, linguistically and culturally distinct from Angolans so that\nthey are have a right to social and economic development. The Complainant contends that the people of\nCabinda are unable to exercise this right because organisations which 'espouse a uniquely Cabindan point\nof view' have been banned by the government of Angola. Complainant alleges further that Cabindans who\ncampaign for economic self-determination are routinely arrested as 'FLEC sympathisers' while foreigners\nwho have identified corruption in Cabinda have been sent to jail. Accordingly the Complainant claims that\nthe Respondent State has violated Article 20 of the African Charter.\n63. On Article 21 of the African Charter, the Complainant contends that grants and concessions (what it\nterms onshore oil and mineral rights offerings) have been made by the Respondent State 'without input\nfrom the Cabindans' and that all decisions regarding natural resources are made from Luanda, the Capital\nof Angola. The Complainant contends that the Cabinda people and FLEC as the representative of the\nCabinda people have not been adequately consulted about the management of 'their onshore resources.\nRather, exploration and exploitation activities have been undertaken under the watch of the Angolan Armed\nForces. Thus, the Complainant disputes the legal right of the Respondent State to exploit and dispose\nonshore resources in Cabinda and alleges that such activities amount to spoliation which is in violation of\nArticle 21 of the African Charter and therefore should be redressed by the Respondent State.\n64. On the alleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter, the Complainant asserts that the people of\nCabinda are a distinct people with a right to economic and social development and contends that the\ncurrent policy of the Respondent State is one of 'Angolanisation of Cabinda' involving discriminating against\nand arresting individuals and groups that claim a Cabindan identity. Accordingly, the Complainant alleges\nthat the Respondent State has violated Article 22 of the African Charter.\n65. Regarding Article 24 of the African Charter, the Complainant alleges that the environment in Cabinda is\nnot conducive for the development of the people of Cabinda. While it claims it does not seek an ideal\nenvironment, the Complainant argues that it seeks an environment that permits 'some measure of equity for\nthe people of Cabinda'. The Complainant contends that the operations of companies such as Chevron take\nplace in conditions that harm human health and the environment because the Respondent State has failed\nto enforce compliance with environmental rules.\n66. The Complainant alleges further that the absence of viable civil society in Cabinda following the ban on\nthe Mpalabanda organisation ensures that the activities of oil companies are not monitored and no\ncompensation is paid in the event of damage to the environment. The Complainant therefore argues that\nthe Respondent State has violated the right of the people of Cabinda to a satisfactory environment as\nguaranteed in Article 24 of the African Charter.\n67. In support of all its allegations, the Complaint has submitted five documents as exhibits. They include a\n\"Republic of Kabinda January 8 2010 Committee Report on the Togolese Incident\"; a 1974 joint\ncommuniqué between Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola MPLA) and the Complainant (FLEC);\na Human Rights Watch report titled \"They Put me in the Hole - Military Detention, Torture and Lack of Due\nProcess in Cabinda\"; a 2008 Chevron Alternative Annual Report titled \"Chevron in Angola\" and an Amnesty\nInternational Public Statement titled \"Angola: Human rights organization banned\". Also submitted in support\nof the Complainant's case are historical accounts presented by different bodies acting on behalf of the\npeoples of Cabinda.\n\n6\n\n\fSummary of Respondent State's Submission\n\n68. In its submission on the merits, the Respondent State argues first that the Communication should not\nhave been declared admissible because that it failed to meet the requirements for admissibility as set out in\nthe African Charter. The Respondent State argues that Article 57 of the African Charter requires that prior\nto the consideration of a Communication on the merit, the Chairperson of the Commission ought to present\nthe Complaint before the Respondent State, setting out procedural matters and indicating whether the\nComplaint conforms to the provisions of the African Charter and other African Union (AU) instruments\nrelevant to the matter. The Respondent State contends that this requirement had not been met with respect\nto the present Communication.\n69. The Respondent State argues further that the Communication is not admissible for failure to comply\nwith the requirements of Articles 50 and 56(5) of the African Charter regarding exhaustion of local\nremedies. The Respondent State also alleges that the Commission failed to comply with Rule 6 (3) of its\nown Rules of Procedure which prohibits \"unrecognised National Liberation Movements from submitting\nmatters for inclusion in the agenda of sessions of the Commission\". The Respondent State insists that the\nComplainant is not qualified to submit this Communication to the African Commission's Session as it is\nneither a State Party nor a party entitled to bring \"Other Communications\" before the Commission.\n70. Citing Articles 3(b)13 and 4(b)14 of the AU Constitutive Act, the Respondent State argues that the\npresent Communication cannot proceed as it challenges the existing borders of an AU Member State and\nthreatens the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Respondent State.\n71. With respect to the merits of the Communication, the Respondent State supplied its version of the\nhistory of Angola emphasising that both the Alvor Accord of 1975 and the Constitution of Angola endow it\nwith sovereignty over the territory now known as Angola, including the Province of Cabinda. The\nRespondent State argues therefore that the right to self-determination has been exercised by the collective\n\"peoples\" of Angola and does not avail minorities and ethnic groups because it can only be available to\nstates emerging from colonial boundaries in recognition of the principle of \"uti possidetis juris\".\n72. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 14 of the African Charter, the Respondent State contends\nthat the right to property is also enshrined in Articles 14 and 37 of its own Constitution. The Respondent\nState argues that the right to property in its Constitution is guaranteed in the interest of individuals,\ncorporate bodies and local communities which \"implies all the people of Angola\"\n73. The Respondent State argues further that the Complainant has not demonstrated that the government\nof Angola does not manage the resources of Cabinda for the benefit of the people of Cabinda. The\nRespondent State avers that the government administers all its natural resources in an equitable and\nbalanced manner as a common asset for the economic, social and cultural development of the country and\nin the national interest.\n74. The Respondent State insists that the government of the Province of Cabinda receives a share of the\nAngolan State General Budget just like every other provincial government in Angola. Further, that by Article\n7 of the Angolan State General Budget Act (no 26/10) the Provinces of Cabinda and Zaire receive amounts\nequal to 10 percent of earnings from petroleum resources in addition to other expenditures and costs for\nthe construction of schools, roads, bridges, harbours, hospitals and other socio-economic infrastructure.\nThus, the Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 14 of the African Charter since its\naffairs are run \"in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws\".\n75. As regards the alleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that\nArticle 21 of its own Constitution provides for the principle of equality and that principle is implemented in all\nits 18 provinces. The Respondent State argues that as a result of its domestic constitutional obligation it\n\"cannot implement measures aimed at developing the country based on the premise that revenue should\nbe spent only in areas where it is generated\". The Respondent State cites the example of its on-going\n\"Strategy to Fight Poverty\" which aims to achieve a \"50% reduction by 2015 in the number of people with\nless than USD1.00 per day\".\n76. The Respondent State insists further that as compared to other provinces, the Province of Cabinda\nenjoys a special status in view of its contribution towards the Angolan State General Budget. The\nRespondent State also asserts that as contained in recent United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) and United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reports, there is an overall improvement\nin areas such as child health care and health care generally. Accordingly, the Respondent State contends,\nit has not violated Article 19 of the African Charter as it relates to the Province of Cabinda.\n77. As regards the alleged violation of Article 20 of the African Charter, the Respondent State contends that\n7\n\n\fthe right has collectively been fulfilled by all the Angolan people through the attainment of independence on\n11 November 1975 and by the conduct of free democratic elections in 1992 and 2008 respectively. The\nRespondent State asserts that according to available records a total of 7, 213, 281 voters representing\n87.36% of the population of Angola went to the polls in the 2008 Legislative elections in Angola. Out of the\n220 deputies elected in the 2008 Legislative elections, 5 came from Cabinda as representatives of the\nCabinda Province. Accordingly, the Respondent State argues that the people of Cabinda are represented\nin the National Assembly of the Republic of Angola by those deputies. In support of these assertions, the\nRespondent State attaches reports of the 2008 and 2012 elections as released by its National Electoral\nCommission.\n78. Accordingly, the Respondent State contends that as with other of its provinces, the Province of Cabinda\nhas its own political and administrative structures which are defined by law. The Respondent State argues\nthat \"like most African peoples, Angola is a multicultural and multilingual society\" and Article 87 of its\nConstitution guarantees the right to respect, appreciation and preservation of the cultural, linguistic and\nartistic identity of the Angolan people. As such, the Respondent State concludes that it has not violated\nArticle 20 of the African Charter.\n79. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 21 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that\nArticles 94 and 95 of its own Constitution create and separate public and private domains of property rights.\nIt asserts that natural resources fall under the public domain and property in the public domain is\nconstitutionally intended to \"serve national interests instead of local interests alone\" since it is expected to\n\"benefit the Angolan people as a whole, with no exception\". The Respondent State points out that the\nComplainant itself agrees that some percentage of oil revenue is already set aside specially for the\nProvince of Cabinda.\n80. The Respondent State contends further that Angola operates a unitary system of government in which\nall provinces are on equal footing such that all public resources should serve the entire population of the\nstate but it was in spite of this fact that the Province of Cabinda has been given special attention as a result\nof its contribution to national oil production.\n81. The Respondent State challenges the Complainant's claim that it (FLEC) is Cabinda's representative\nand argues that the Complainant \"lacks moral, legal and any other form of legitimacy\" therefore it cannot\nspeak on behalf of the people of Cabinda. The Respondent State insists that as a sovereign state, Angola\nhas the legitimacy and the right to explore the natural resources in its territory, including those found in any\nof its 18 provinces. Thus, it argues that it has not violated Article 21 of the African Charter.\n82. In relation to the alleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter, the Respondent State argues that\nthe Complainant has failed to produce any evidence to sustain a claim that the rights of the people of\nCabinda have been violated. The Respondent State asserts that since Cabinda is part of a single,\nindivisible and inalienable territory (Angola) it finds no reason or basis to defend a claim that Cabinda is\nbeing \"Angolanised\".\n83. The Respondent State contends that its citizens are Angolans by origin both according to its domestic\nlaw and in international law. It being the case, that there is no such thing as the State of Cabinda in Africa\nbut a Cabinda that is a province \"which is an integral part of the Angolan State\", the Respondent State\nargues that it retains a right to punish by law, \"every deed, action or attempt to divide the Angolan State\".\nThe Respondent State therefore argues that it has not violated Article 22 of the African Charter.\n84. On the alleged violation of Article 24 of the African Charter, the Respondent State asserts that it takes\nthe characteristics of Cabinda's oil fields and forests into account and has taken measures with a view to\npreserving the environment. The Respondent State cites the enactment of legislation at national and local\nlevels based on an entrenched right to a healthy and unpolluted environment in Article 39 of its\nConstitution. The Respondent State contends further that it has a Basic Environment Act in addition to a\nnumber of other statutes and institutions such as a Multi-Sector Technical Commission and the National\nEnvironment Authority which address the issues arising from oil exploration.\n85. The Respondent State claims further that by a Presidential Decree of 2011, oil companies are required\nto account for any harm stemming from oil spills, while paying greater attention to fishermen and their\nfamilies. The Respondent State admits that there have been oil spills in the Province of Cabinda but that its\nMinistry of Environment's National Environment Surveillance Service has kept track of at least six of these\nspills, compelling oil companies to compensate fishermen and to replace items that had been lost or\ndamaged.\n86. The Respondent State asserts further that it has legislation which compels concessionaires and their\nassociates to take preventive and practical measures to address environmental damage. Such measures\n8\n\n\finclude the generation of evaluation studies and environment impact audits, landscape and structural\nreplenishment plans and standing contract mechanisms for environmental management and auditing.\n87. The Respondent State submits that following an accident in the Gulf of Mexico, its Ministry of\nEnvironment has audited oil rigs in the Angolan sea \"with a view to preventing a repetition of what\nhappened in ... the Western Hemisphere\". It also claims that its Ministry of Environment has \"been holding\npublic consultation on environment impact evaluation in the Cabinda South Block in terms of Decree No\n51\". The Respondent State contends that these measures are not restricted to the oil sector but are\nextended to other resources. Thus, it argues that it has not violated Article 24 of the African Charter.\n88. In proof of its assertion, the Respondent State attached the results of its 2008 and 2012 Legislative\nelections result but no other documents apart from a \"Memorandum of Understanding and Integration of\nFLEC Members\" which states that the Respondent State has spent huge sums of money to register and\ndemobilise former FLEC soldiers. The Respondent State concludes by insisting that the Communication\nshould be considered inadmissible \"for lacking a legal basis and probable cause\".\nComplainant's Supplementary Submission\n\n89. In its supplementary submission in reply to the Respondent State's arguments on the merit, the\nComplainant reaffirmed and expanded on its version of the history of Cabinda in order to show that the\nterritory of Cabinda was historically administered separately from mainland Angola and had a people with\ndistinct linguistic, cultural and political identity.\nAmicus Submissions\n\n90. Between January and March 2012 and again in June 2013, a number of submissions were made by a\nnumber of organisations representing different interests of the Cabinda people. With the consent of the\nlegal representative of the Complainant, those submissions are considered as amicus briefs. In all their\nsubmissions, the different groups advance the Complainant's version of historical facts and insist that the\npeople of Cabinda are victims of unlawful, aggressive and unilateral invasion by the government of the\nRespondent State. The groups submit that as a result of these historical facts and considering that the\npeople of Cabinda were not consulted before their territory was ceded to Angola, the actions of the\nRespondent State amount to colonialism or neo-colonialism such that the people of Cabinda are entitled to\nself-determination.\nThe Commission's Analysis on the Merits\n91. Although it did not submit its observations on the Admissibility of the Communication despite the receipt\nof a formal invitation and reminders to that effect from the Secretariat,15 the first part of the Respondent\nState's submission on the Merit challenges the Admissibility of the Communication and raises issues that\namount to a preliminary objection to the consideration of the Communication. Before analysing the merits of\nthis Communication, the Commission considers it necessary to address some of the concerns raised by the\nRespondent State even though most of those issues ought to have been raised at the admissibility stage.\n92. The Commission notes the Respondent State's argument that Article 57 of the African Charter requires\nthat a Communication to be considered by the Commission should first be presented to the concerned\nState Party by the Chairperson of the African Commission, setting out procedural matters and indicating\nwhether the Communication conforms to the provisions of the African Charter and other AU instruments.\nArticle 57 reads as follows: Prior to any substantive consideration, all communications shall be brought to\nthe knowledge of the State concerned by the Chairman of the Commission\n93. The Commission affirms that Article 57 of the Charter obligates it to notify a State Party of the existence\nof a Complaint against such a State Party so that the State Party can participate in the proceedings. The\nCommission recalls that notice of this Communication was transmitted to the Respondent State by Note\nVerbale dated 28 February 2007. As indicated in paragraphs 16 to 20 and paragraphs 24 to 27 of the\nAdmissibility decision, the Secretariat through several subsequent correspondences transmitted to the\nRespondent State the original Complaint and all other documents filed by the Complainant regarding this\nCommunication. Further, as noted in paragraph 39 above, at least ten (10) reminders were sent to the\nRespondent State to respond to the Admissibility arguments but these did not yield any response from the\nRespondent State. Accordingly, the African Commission notes that it has satisfied its duty to the\nRespondent State as required by Article 57 of the African Charter.\n9\n\n\f94. The Respondent State further contends that the African Commission has failed to comply with Rule\n6(3)16 of its own Rules of Procedure. The Commission notes that the provisions cited by the Respondent\nState relating to the Provisional Agenda of the Commission's sessions are now contained in Rule 32 of the\nCommission's Rules of Procedure. The Commission recalls that Rule 32(2) of its Rules of Procedure\nprovides as follows: The provisional Agenda shall include but not be limited to, items on \"Communications\nfrom States\" and \"Other Communications\" in accordance with the provisions of Articles 48, 49 and 55 of the\nCharter.\n95. The Commission reaffirms that Rule 32(2) of its Rules of Procedure permits \"Other Communications\"17\nsuch as the one now being considered to be included in the Agenda of the Commission's Session. In line\nwith that provision, the present Communication is properly before the Commission as it has duly been\nincluded in the Agenda of the Session.\n96. The Respondent State contends further that the present Communication ought to have been declared\ninadmissible because it fails to comply with certain aspects of Article 56 of the African Charter. The\nCommission recalls that the Respondent State was contacted at every stage and given ample opportunity\nto present its position and arguments regarding the admissibility of this Communication but the Respondent\nState did not take advantage of the opportunity.\n97. The Commission notes further that in the event that a State Party fails to submit its observations on\nadmissibility within 60 days from the receipt of the Complainant's submission from the Secretariat as set out\nin Rule 105(2) of the Commission's Rules of Procedure, this Commission is authorised to proceed to make\na decision on the admissibility of the Communication. In such cases, the Commission examines the\nadmissibility submissions of the Complainant against the provisions of Article 56 of the African Charter. The\nCommission notes that in relation to the present Communication, this procedure has been followed to the\nletter. Accordingly, the Commission cannot revisit its admissibility decision in respect of the\nCommunication.\n98. Notwithstanding the fact that its Admissibility decision in respect of the Communication will not be\nreviewed, the Commission notes the Respondent State's argument that the present Communication should\nhave been declared inadmissible on the grounds that it contradicts Articles 3(b) and 4(b) of the AU\nConstitutive Act. In that regard, the Commission recalls the Complainant's submission that the present\nCommunication does not seek a decision on political self-determination or a right to secede from the\nRespondent State.\n99. In its correspondences and submissions to the Secretariat, the Complainant has maintained that its\nclaim is strictly restricted to a request for a decision on economic self-determination and a determination of\nthe right of the people of Cabinda to enjoy the use of natural resources located within the Province of\nCabinda. The Commission has also considered the prayers of the Complainant and notes that the claims\nas formulated do not contradict the provisions of Articles 3(b) and 4(b) of the AU Constitutive Act. The\nCommission does not consider itself bound to pronounce on the amicus briefs which seek to introduce\nsecessionist dimensions to the Communication. Accordingly, the Commission proceeds to determine the\nCommunication based on the submissions of the Parties.\nAlleged violation of article 14\n\n100. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated the right to property of the people of\nCabinda contrary to Article 14 of the African Charter. Article 14 of the African Charter provides as follows:\nThe right to property shall be guaranteed. It may only be encroached upon in the interest of public need or\nin the general interest of the community and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\n101. The Complainant contends that an incident of the right to property as guaranteed in the African\nCharter is that the natural resources of Cabinda must be administered largely for the benefit of the people\nof Cabinda since the people of Cabinda claim a distinct identity from the rest of Angola. It is also the\nComplainant's argument that the Respondent State is not entitled to unilaterally grant resource licences\nand concessions on Cabinda resources.\n102. The Respondent State submits that its Constitution provides for the right to property and that the\nconstitutional right is available to all the peoples of Angola. However, the State argues that certain items\nare classified in its Constitution as property in the public domain intended to serve the wider national\ninterest rather than the interest of a smaller unit within the state. The Respondent State further challenges\nthe Complainant's argument that the Government of Angola has not managed natural resources for the\nbenefit of Cabinda people.\n10\n\n\f103. Generally, this Commission has stated in its jurisprudence that the role of the State in relation to the\nright to property is \"to respect and protect this right against any form of encroachment, and to regulate the\nexercise of this right in order for it to be accessible to everyone.18 One way of fulfilling Charter obligation on\nthe right to property is therefore to adopt legislation which recognises the principle of ownership and\npeaceful enjoyment of property. The inclusion of the right to property in the Angolan Constitution is\ntherefore in compliance with the Respondent State's Charter duty.\n104. With regards to the general question whether a \"people\" can be bearers of the right to property under\nthe African Charter, this Commission has previously answered in the affirmative in relation to indigenous\npeoples in Africa.19 The African Commission reaffirms that a collective or communal right to property exists\nas a component of the right to property in Article 14 of the African Charter. Similar to the individual right to\nproperty, the communal right to property entails a state duty to recognise and protect peaceful enjoyment of\nownership by a group or people subject to limitation by a state in the interest of public need or in the\ngeneral interest and in accordance with the provisions of appropriate laws.\n105. The Commission has also expressed the opinion that natural resources located in land owned or\noccupied by a people can be the subject of ownership in the context of the right to property under the\nAfrican Charter.20 In the Commission's view, protection of communal property rights to natural resources as\na component of land right enjoyed by indigenous peoples is not alien to the African Charter or to\ninternational human rights generally.21 One justification for the protection of this aspect of the right is the\nstrong traditional attachment to their cultural land that indigenous peoples hold on to such that their survival\ndepends on the resources they traditionally extract from the land.22\n106. The Commission notes that the Complainant does not claim that the people of Cabinda are indigenous\npeoples with strong attachment to their land and their culture. The basis of the Complainant's claim is that\nCabinda existed as a distinct Portuguese protectorate prior to 1975 when it was declared to be part of an\nindependent Angola without the consent of the people of Cabinda. The Commission does not believe that\ndistinct pre-colonial history on its own currently suffices to sustain a claim for special protection of a\ndistinctive overriding communal right to property under the Charter.\n107. In the absence of evidence that land in Cabinda is communally owned in a traditional context and that\nthe people of Cabinda had and continue to hold on to strong attachment to their land as part of a distinct\nculture which requires dependence on land and its resources for the survival of the people of Cabinda, the\nright to property can be validly limited by the State in the overall public interest of the entire state and in\naccordance with appropriate laws.\n108. In line with its obligation under International law, the African Charter and its domestic laws generally,\nthe Respondent State can only limit the right to property under certain laid down conditions. The\nComplainant has not claimed or adduced evidence to show that the limitation of the right in relation to the\npeople of Cabinda was not done in the public interest and according to appropriate laws.\n109. The Commission recalls the Complainant's argument that an incident of the right to property under the\nCharter is that the people of Cabinda are entitled to be the main beneficiaries of the natural resources and\nthat the Respondent State cannot unilaterally dispose of the natural resources of the people of Cabinda\nwithout their involvement in decisions on such disposal. The Commission agrees with the Complainant that\nas an aspect of the right to property under the Charter, the people of Cabinda are entitled to benefit from\nthe natural resource found in their lands. However, the Commission believes that the enjoyment of that\naspect of the right should not be to the detriment of other communities and groups in the State. The\nCommission notes further that the Respondent State's submission that the people of Cabinda (along with\nthe province of Zaire23 ) enjoy a fair and equitable share of the proceeds of the petroleum resources of the\nState has not been challenged despite the Complainant's claim that the people of Cabinda are entitled to\nan additional 50% of proceeds from natural resources.\n110. The Commission finds that the Complainant has failed to show that the people of Cabinda have a\nstrong and profound cultural or ancestral attachment to their land and the natural resources under the land\nsuch that their survival depends on its protection. The Complainant has also failed to show that the\nRespondent State has denied the people of Cabinda a right to share equitably in the benefits accruing from\ntheir natural resources. Accordingly, the African Commission finds no violation in relation to Article 14 of the\nAfrican Charter.\n\n11\n\n\fAlleged violation of Article 19 of the African Charter\n\n111. The Complainant contends that the Respondent State has violated Article 19 of the Charter because\nthe people of Cabinda have not enjoyed the right to equality as a people entitled to the same respect and\nrights as other peoples in Angola. Article 19 provides that: All peoples shall be equal; they shall enjoy the\nsame respect and shall have the same rights. Nothing shall justify the domination of a people by another.\n112. It is the Complainant's submission that Article 19 of the Charter has been violated in relation to the\npeople of Cabinda because it anticipates that revenue from onshore resource extraction will \"flow to\nLuanda just as offshore revenue does now\". The Complainant alleges further that despite the resources\nextracted from Cabinda, unemployment is high and poverty, infant mortality and disease are higher in\nCabinda than in most other areas of Angola. Thus, it claims the Respondent State has violated Article 19 of\nthe African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\n113. In response to the alleged violation of Article 19 of the Charter, the Respondent State contends that its\nConstitution provides for the principle of equality and this is implemented in all its 18 provinces. The\nRespondent State argues further that 'it cannot implement measures aimed at developing the country\nbased on the premise that revenue should only be spent in areas where it is generated. The Respondent\nState submits that while it is developing the entire country, the Province of Cabinda enjoys a \"special status\nin view of its contribution towards the Angolan State General Budget\". Thus, it claims that it has not violated\nArticle 19 of the African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\n114. The Commission reaffirms its position that distinct and identifiable groups of \"peoples\" and\ncommunities exist within the State Parties to the African Charter and each set of \"peoples\" and\ncommunities is entitled to enjoy internal legal equality vis-?-vis other \"peoples\" and communities within the\nsame state.24 The Commission notes that a claim of unequal treatment in violation of Article 19 of the\nCharter requires evidence that a given group or set of peoples who is in a position similar to another group\nor set of people has been or is being treated differently or that a given group or set of peoples who is in a\nposition different to another group or set of people is treated similarly such that the \"peoples\" complaining\nsuffer unfair and unjustifiable disadvantage that amounts to discrimination.\n115. In its submission, the Complainant contends that the bulk of the anticipated revenue from the\nresources in Cabinda will \"flow to Luanda while only 10% or less will get to Cabinda\". The Complainant\ndoes not elaborate to show whether any single group of people in the Respondent State enjoys a greater\nshare of allocation than the People of Cabinda. The Complainant also provides no documentary or other\nevidence in support of its claim. The Complainant does not produce the 2006 Peace Accord which it refers\nto in its submission. However, the Respondent State does not contest the claims but admits them partially\nto the extent that the Respondent State submits that the Province of Cabinda enjoys a special status since\nit receives up to 10% of oil revenue.\n116. The Commission notes the Respondent State's submission that the 10% special revenue that accrues\nto Cabinda is in addition to other infrastructural costs that the Government funds in the Province of\nCabinda. Although the Respondent State has also failed to adduce any documentary or other evidence in\nsupport of this claim, the Complainant has not contested the Respondent State's claim that only the\nProvince of Cabinda (along with the Province of Zaire) enjoy the \"special status\". Accordingly, the\nCommission will make its decision on the basis of the unchallenged submissions of the Parties.\n117. Generally, the Commission holds the view that real or substantive equality requires that groups who\nhave suffered previous disadvantages or continue to suffer disadvantages within a state are entitled to\nsome advantageous treatment especially where such groups bear an unequal part of the burden for the\nexploration of natural resources in that state.25 However, the Commission also notes the Respondent\nState's argument that it cannot implement measures that aim at spending revenue only in areas where it is\ngenerated.\n118. The Commissions takes the view that the principle of equality requires the striking of a balance\nbetween a group's claim to advantageous treatment or affirmative action and the legitimate expectation of\nother groups within the state to share in the resources of that state. Accordingly, the Commission believes\nthat a proper interpretation of equality in the present circumstance is one which recognises the right of the\npeople of Cabinda to receive some advantage without endangering the survival of other peoples within the\nstate or threatening the continued corporate existence of the Respondent State.\n119. Although the Complainant contends that the people of Cabinda suffer unequal treatment as compared\nto the rest of Angola in terms of comparatively higher levels of unemployment, poverty, infant mortality and\ndisease, no tangible evidence or data has been adduced to support these claims. As this Commission had\n12\n\n\fpreviously observed, a Complainant that has made general claims and allegations needs to substantiate\nsuch claims and allegations with either documentary evidence or sworn affidavits or the corroborating\ntestimony of others.26 In the absence of evidence to support the claim of unequal treatment, the\nCommission does not find a violation of Article 19 of the Charter.\nAlleged violation of Article 20 of the African Charter\n\n120. Basing its argument on an acclaimed geographical, political, linguistic and cultural distinction from the\nrest of Angola, the Complainant claims that the Respondent State has violated the right of the people of\nCabinda to social and economic development as guaranteed in Article 20 of the African Charter. The\nComplainant submits that the people of Cabinda are unable to exercise the right because organisations\nthat \"espouse a uniquely Cabindan point of view\" are banned by the Government of Angola.\n121. The Complainant alleges further that the enjoyment of the right to social and economic development is\nrestricted because people who campaign for economic self-determination are routinely arrested. On these\ngrounds, the Complainant alleges that the right of the people of Cabinda to social and economic\ndevelopment had been violated.\n122. The Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 20 of the African Charter in relation to\nthe people of Cabinda because the right to self-determination had been collectively fulfilled by the entire\npeople of Angola at independence in 1975. The Respondent State submits further the periodic democratic\nelections take place in Angola and as citizens of Angola, the people of Cabinda have participated fully at\nsuch elections, producing 5 out of 220 deputies elected to the Angolan Parliament.\n123. It is the Respondent State's further contention that Cabinda also has its own political and\nadministrative structures defined by Angolan law. On these grounds and in view of Article 87 of its\nConstitution which acknowledges that Angola is a multicultural and multilingual society where the different\nidentities are to be appreciated and respected, the Respondent State contends that it has not violated\nArticle 20 of the African Charter in relation to the people of Cabinda.\n124. The Commission recalls that Article 20 of the Charter has a particular historical context in the sense\nthat it is one of the provisions of the Charter that was aimed at addressing the situation of Africans who\nremained under colonial domination at the time the Charter was drafted. Article 20 of the Charter provides\nthat :\n\n1. All peoples shall have the right to existence. They shall have the unquestionable and inalienable\nright to self-determination. They shall freely determine their political status and shall pursue their\neconomic and social development according to the policy they have freely chosen.\n2. Colonised or oppressed people shall have the right to free themselves from the bonds of domination\nby resorting to any means recognised by the international community.\n3. All peoples shall have the right to the assistance of the State Parties to the present Charter in their\nliberation struggle against foreign domination, be it political, economic or cultural.\n125. The Commission notes the argument of the Complainant regarding the alleged violation of Article 20\nof the Charter. In view of its opinion that the right to self-determination, the right of colonised and oppressed\npeople to free themselves from domination and the right to assistance in liberation struggle are reserved for\ncolonised peoples, the Commission does not agree with the Complainant that a distinct pre-colonial history\nby itself entitles the people of Cabinda to unilaterally claim those rights contained vis-?-vis the Respondent\nState.\n126. As the Commission has noted in its earlier jurisprudence, in post-colonial Africa, the right to self\ndetermination can be enjoyed within the existing territories and with full respect for the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of State Parties to the Charter.27 The Commission also believes that the right to pursue\neconomic and social development is attainable within the framework of an existing state insofar as different\ngroups and communities are represented in decision-making institutions of the given state. Accordingly, the\nCommission does not find any violation of Article 20 of the Charter.\n\n13\n\n\fAlleged violation of Article 21 of the African Charter\n\n127. In relation to Article 21, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated the right of\nthe people of Cabinda to freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources because the Respondent\nState has made grants and concessions on Cabinda's onshore oil resources \"without input from the\nCabindans\". The Complainant contends that the acts the Respondent State in this regard amount to\nspoliation under Article 21 of the Charter and should attract a right to lawful recovery and to an adequate\ncompensation. Article 21 of the African Charter states as follows:\n\n1. All peoples shall freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources. This right shall be exercised in\nthe exclusive interest of the people. In no case shall a people be deprived of it.\n2. In all cases of spoliation, the disposed people shall have the right to the lawful recovery of its\nproperty as well as to an adequate compensation.\n3. The free disposal of wealth and natural resources shall be exercised without prejudice to the\nobligation of promoting international economic cooperation based on mutual respect, equitable\nexchange and the principles of international law.\n4. State Parties to the present Charter shall individually and collectively exercise the right to free\ndisposal of their wealth and natural resources with a view to strengthening African Unity and\nsolidarity.\n5. State Parties to the present Charter shall undertake to eliminate all forms of foreign exploitation\nparticularly that practiced by all international monopolies so as to enable their peoples to fully\nbenefit from the advantages derived from their national resources.\n128. The Respondent State argues that by Articles 94 and 95 of its Constitution, natural resources fall in\nthe category of items classified as property in the public domain which are reserved to serve national rather\nnarrow local interests. The Respondent State submits further the Province of Cabinda already receives\nspecial attention for its contribution to oil revenues. Asserting its sovereign authority and legitimacy to\nexplore natural resources in Angolan territory, the Respondent State challenges the authority and\nlegitimacy of the Complainant to speak on behalf of the people of Cabinda with regards to the exploitation\nof natural resources.\n129. The Commission recalls its jurisprudence which traces the origin of Article 21 to the colonial era when\nhuman and material resources in Africa were exploited for the benefit of powers from outside the\ncontinent.28 However, the Commission has also held that the rights in Article 21 of the Charter are still\napplicable in post-colonial Africa in favour of groups within states to the extent that it triggers an obligation\non the part of the State Parties to protect their citizens from exploitation by external economic powers29 and\nto ensure that groups and communities, directly or through their representatives, are involved in decisions\nrelating to the disposal of their wealth.30 Nevertheless, the Commission also recognises the right of State\nParties to supervise the disposal of wealth in the general interest of the state and its communities.31\n130. The Commission notes that in relation to Article 21 of the Charter, the Complaint invokes a right of the\npeople of Cabinda to dispose of their wealth and natural resources as well as to receive compensation for\nresources already exploited. In this regard, the Commission notes that the term \"peoples\" in Article 21 of\nthe Charter can mean either the entire peoples of a given state or a \"peoples\" within the state. The\nCommission believes that in the first context, Article 21 of the African Charter empowers a State Party to\nexercise the guaranteed right free from interference from any other African or non-African state. This has to\nbe the explanation for sub-Articles 4 and 5 of Article 21 which speak to State Parties.\n131. However, the Commission believes that a \"peoples\" within an existing state can be beneficiaries of the\nright in Article 21 to the extent that it imposes a duty on the Respondent State to ensure that resources are\neffectively managed for the sole and equal benefit of the entire peoples of the state. Accordingly, the\nAfrican Commission is of the view that one aspect of the right in Article 21 of the African Charter is the duty\nof the State to involve representatives of its peoples in decisions concerning the management of national\nwealth and natural resources.\n132. The Respondent State has shown that elected representatives of the people of Cabinda are in the\nAngolan Parliament which exercises oversight supervision of the management of natural resources. As this\nCommission noted in SERAC v Nigeria,32 the State has the right to exploit natural resources in its territory.\nHowever, the Commission believes that Article 21 of the African Charter presupposes that that right is held\n14\n\n\fin trust for the people. The Respondent State's submission that it effectively manages natural resources for\nthe benefit of all peoples in Angola has not been challenged. The Commission therefore finds no violation\nof Article 21 of the Charter.\nAlleged violation of Article 22 of the African Charter\n\n133. The Complainant's allegation that the Respondent State has violated Article 22 of the African Charter\nwith regards to the people of Cabinda is based exclusively on the argument that the Respondent State\npursues a policy of \"Angolanisation of Cabinda\". In the absence of any other argument or evidence in\nsupport, the African Commission finds no violation.\nAlleged violation of Article 24 of the African Charter\n\n134. The Complainant alleges that the Respondent State has violated Article 24 of the African Charter in\nrelation to the people of Cabinda because, as a result of oil exploitation activities authorised by the State,\nthe environment in Cabinda is not conducive for the development of the people of Cabinda. The\nComplainant argues further that the operations of companies such as Chevron which are authorised by the\nRespondent State take place in conditions that harm both human health and the environment and this has\nhappened because in the absence of viable civil society monitoring, the Respondent State has failed to\nenforce compliance with environmental rules.\n135. The Respondent State contends that it has not violated Article 24 of the African Charter in relation to\nthe people of Cabinda since it has taken measures aimed at preserving the environment. The Respondent\nState cites national legislations that it has adopted to address the challenge of environmental pollution. The\nRespondent State submits further that it has compelled oil companies operating in the area to account for\nharm occasioned by oil spills, with emphasis on demanding compensation for fishermen and their families.\nThe Respondent also claims that it has set up a National Environment Surveillance Service that has kept\ntrack of at least six oil spills in the area while its Ministry of Environment has audited rigs in the Angolan sea\nto prevent further spills. In effect, the Respondent State contends that it has taken action to address the\nconcerns of the Complainant.\n136. The African Commission notes that apart from the fact that it did not adduce any evidence in support\nof the general allegation that the right to a satisfactory environment has been violated by the Respondent\nState, the Complainant has not disputed or challenged the claims of the Respondent State. In the absence\nof any evidence to support the alleged violation, the African Commission finds no violation of Article 24 of\nthe African Charter.\n\nDecision of the African Commission\n137. In view of the above, the African Commission finds no violations of Articles 14, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24\nof the African Charter as alleged by the Complainants.\nDone in Banjul, the Gambia during the 54th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human\nand Peoples Rights, 22 October to 5 November 2013.\n\nFootnotes\n1 Angola ratified the African Charter on 2 March 1990.\n2 The alleged violations include extrajudicial/summary executions, arbitrary arrests and detention, sexual\nviolence, denial of civilians' freedom of movement, torture and other mistreatment.\n3 By email to the Secretariat dated 17 Feb 2012, Dr Levy advised the Secretariat to consider submission\nfrom Cabindan groups other himself as amicus briefs.\n4 Notes Verbale were sent to the Republic of Angola on 28 February 2007, 10 May 2007, 20 August 2007,\n19 December 2007, 25 March 2009, 27 April 2009, 23 June 2010, 30 September 2010, 7 December 2010\nand 11 August 2011.\n5 Communication 292/04 - Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa v.

Without them, the very physical and cultural survival of such\npeoples is at stake.123 Hence the need to protect the lands and resources they have traditionally used to\nprevent their extinction as a people. That is, the aim and purpose of the special measures required on\nbehalf of the members of indigenous and tribal communities is to guarantee that they may continue living\ntheir traditional way of life, and that their distinct cultural identity, social structure, economic system,\ncustoms, beliefs and traditions are respected, guaranteed and protected by States.\n.\n22 Ibid\n23 The Respondent State submits that the Province of Zaire also contributes significantly to the natural\nresources of Angola and accordingly, together with the Cabinda Province, enjoy certain privileges over and\nabove other provinces.\n24 COHRE case, para 223\n25 This is consistent with international best practices. See for instance, the Saramaka decision, para 103\n× Furthermore, the State's argument that it would be discriminatory to pass legislation that recognizes\ncommunal forms of land ownership is also without merit. It is a wellestablished principle of international law\nthat unequal treatment towards persons in unequal situations does not necessarily amount to impermissible\ndiscrimination. Legislation that recognizes said differences is therefore not necessarily discriminatory. In the\ncontext of members of indigenous and tribal peoples, this Court has already stated that special measures\nare necessary in order to ensure their survival in accordance with their traditions and customs (supra paras.\n78-86, 91, and 96). Thus, the State's arguments regarding its inability to create legislation in this area due\nto the alleged complexity of the issue or the possible discriminatory nature of such legislation are without\nmerit.\n26 Communication 308/05 - Majuru v Zimbabwe (2008) ACHPR, para 92\n27 Communication 75/92 - Katangese Peoples' Congress v Zaire (1995) ACHPR para 4\n28 Communication 155/96 - Social and Economic Rights Action Center (SERAC) & Center for Economic\nand Social Rights (CESR) v Nigeria (SERAC v Nigeria) (2001) para 56\n16\n\n\f29 SERAC v Nigeria, paras 57-58\n30 Endorois v Kenya, para 268\n31 Ibid\n32 155/96 para 54\n\n17\n\n\f"},{"_id":"f98e2f239a97999a6003f7b40c0220d7","sourceRange":{"start":1292,"end":1326},"targetDocument":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080c4836","targetRange":{"start":9336,"end":9663},"sourceDocument":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080ce87a","type":"reference"},{"_id":"f98e2f239a97999a6003f7b40c022c2b","sourceRange":{"start":827,"end":866},"targetDocument":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080fc808","targetRange":{"start":3822,"end":4017},"sourceDocument":"a901de64992c1acddbbc2a93080ce87a","type":"reference"},{"_id":"f98e2f239a97999a6003f7b40c023901","title":"334 06 Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and Interights v.

Egypt\nSummary of the Complaint\n1. This communication is brought before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the\nAfrican Commission or the Commission) on behalf of Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, Mohamed Abdalla\nAbu-Gareer and Ossama Mohamed Al-Nakhlawy (the Victims), by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal\nRights and Interights (the Complainants).\n2. The Respondent State is Egypt, a State Party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the\nAfrican Charter or the Charter).\n3. The Complainants state that the Victims were tried and sentenced to death after being accused of\nbombings which took place on 6 October 2004 and 23 July 2005 on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.\n4. The Complainants submit that on the night of 7 October 2004, three bombings took place in the Taba\nHilton Hotel and in two tourist resorts (Al-Badia and Gozor Al-Qamer) near Nuweiba, on the Sinai Peninsula\n(\"the Taba bombings\"). They further state that as a result of the attacks, 34 people died and at least 157\nwere injured. The Complainants say that the Victims were Egyptian, Israeli and other foreign tourists and\nworkers.\n5. They allege that the security forces of the Respondent State responded with a campaign of mass arrests\nand detentions in Northern Sinai, from where the perpetrators of the attacks were believed to have\noriginated. According to the Complainants, among those taken into custody was the First Victim, Mohamed\nGayez Sabbah.\n6. The Complainants also state that on 23 July 2005, a series of new bombings took place in the city of\nSharm El-Sheikh on the Sinai Peninsula, and that following those attacks, the security forces again\narrested a large number of Egyptian citizens, including Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani al-Nakhlawy (the\nSecond Victim) and Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer (the third victim), on 12 August and 28 September 2005,\nrespectively.\n7. According to the Complainants, agents of the State Security Intelligence (the SSI) subjected the victims\nto various forms of torture and ill-treatment during their detention, in order to \"confess\" before the State\nSecurity Prosecutor for their involvement in the Taba bombings. The Complainants state that the victims\nwere held incommunicado for a long period of time without access to a lawyer.\n8. The Complainants state that the victims were denied necessary medical attention as well forensic\nmedical examination during interrogation sessions. They allege that the victims were charged with crimes in\nrelation to the Taba bombings and were tried by the Supreme State Security Emergency Court in a trial\ncharacterized by procedural and substantive anomalies. They further allege that the court's decision was\nbased substantially on the 'confessions' obtained through torture and prolonged ill-treatment.\n9. They state that on 30 November 2006, the victims were sentenced to death by hanging. The\nComplainants state that the First Victim, Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, was arrested on 22 October 2004\npursuant to an Administrative Order issued under Law 162/1958 of the State of Emergency (the Emergency\nLaw).1 The Complainants allege that the first victim was held incommunicado detention by SSI agents until\nMarch 2005. They state that SSI agents blindfolded and bound the first victim, and occasionally hung him\nfrom the ceiling by his arms and legs.\n10. The Complainants state that the First Victim was held in these conditions for 96 days, being untied only\nduring his interrogation by the State Security Prosecutor.\n11. They further allege that SSI agents applied electrical shocks to several parts of his body. They state\nthat beatings and torture took place before and after his interrogation sessions by State Security\nProsecutors which started on 3 November 2004 and that most of the interrogation sessions took place\naround midnight and lasted for several hours each.\n12. They allege that despite the fact that the First Victim was tortured before these sessions, the\ninterrogation sheet completed by the State Security Prosecutor in respect of the First Victim indicated that\nthere were no visible injuries on his body.\n13. According to the Complainants, during the first interrogation session, the First Victim denied\ninvolvement in the Taba bombings. The Complainants submit that it was during the second session, held\non 4 November 2004 that the First Victim \"confessed\" to the State Security Prosecutor. The Complainants\n1\n\n\falso aver that the First Victim was held incommunicado, without access to his family, legal counsel, medical\ncare or a court until 24 March 2005. Requests for access to a defence lawyer by the first victim were\nignored.\n14. The Complainants allege that a plea submitted by a group of human rights lawyers to the Public\nProsecutor's Office, which exercises oversight over the State Security Prosecutor's Office, requesting\npermission to represent the victims together with others whose names had been printed in the local press\nas the chief suspects in the investigation of the Taba bombings, went unanswered.2\n15. Thus according to the Complainants, from the date of arrest on 22 October 2004 to 24 March 2005, the\nFirst Victim was denied access to counsel and that it was on 24 March 2005 that a lawyer attended the final\ninterrogation hearing during which the First Victim retracted his \"confessions\".\n16. The Complainants assert that the First Victim also requested medical attention and a forensic\nexamination in relation to his allegations of torture while in detention but the request for a forensic\nexamination was rejected by the Public Prosecutor's Office according to the viciously circular logic that only\na legal representative (which he was also denied) could make such a claim.\n17. According to the Complainants, the charges against the victims and two other individuals in relation to\nthe Taba bombings were referred to the Supreme State Security Emergency Court in Ismailiya on 30 March\n2005, and listed as case No. 40/20053 . They state that the trial started on 2 July 2005 and it was at this\ntime that the First Victim appeared before a judge for the first time since his arrest, eight months earlier.\nThe Complainants also assert that during the first hearing on 2 July 2005 the First Victim informed the court\nthat he had been tortured by SSI officers before and after interrogation sessions, in an attempt to force him\nto confess.\n18. The Complainants further state that the First Victim told the prosecutor about his torture and requested\nmedical attention, but the prosecutor denied his requests.\n19. The Complainants state that it was during this hearing that the First Victim and his defence counsel\nrequested that he be examined by a forensic expert. According to the Complainants, the court itself\nexamined the First Victim in camera, in the presence of his defence counsel as well as a lawyer attending\nthe hearing on behalf of Human Rights Watch. They state that he was stripped of his clothes for the court to\nexamine whether there were any physical signs of torture and that the court found \"... brown spots on his\narms.\"4 The Complainants further state that, as a result, the court granted the application for a medical\nexamination, and adjourned the trial to 24 July 2005.\n20. The Complainants aver that the Forensic Medical Authority (FMA) examination took place eight months\nafter the victim's alleged torture and that the report, dated 5 July 2005, noted injuries that were consistent\nwith the First Victim having been subjected to torture, including \"healings\" and \"dark discolorations\" on his\nright and left forearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint.5\n21. The Complainants also state that the two Government examiners concluded that \"due to the long lapse\nof time and the fact that the marks were not examined at the time they occurred, it was not possible to\ndetermine with certitude the reason, manner or time of such marks.\"6 According to the Complainants,\nfurther charges were preferred against the First Victim during his trial on 25 March 2006, in relation to the\nTaba bombings.\n22. The Complainants submit that the Second Victim, Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani Al-Nakhlawy, was\narrested on 12 August 2005 and placed under administrative detention pursuant to a decree of the Minister\nof Interior issued under the Emergency Law.\n23. The Complainants further submit that the Second Victim was also tortured by SSI officers during the\ninitial period of his detention and interrogation, including the use of electric shocks, beatings and\nsuspension from the roof in painful positions. They state that the Second Victim was only informed of the\ncharges against him on 22 August 2005, when he first appeared before the State Security Prosecutor for\ninterrogation.\n24. The Complainants assert that during the interrogation session, the Second Victim agreed to sign a\nwritten confession recounting his role in the Taba bombings. They state that during this session, the State\nSecurity Prosecutor indicated on the interrogation sheet that there were no visible injuries on the body of\nthe Second Victim.\n25. According to the Complainants, the Second Victim was denied access to a lawyer during the\ninterrogation sessions, which spanned a period of seven months and that during the session held on 19\nMarch 2006, the second victim insisted on summoning lawyers to represent him and to that effect\nsubmitted the names and mobile phone numbers of two human rights lawyers.\n\n2\n\n\f26. The Complainants further submit that on 25 March 2006, the State Security Prosecutor presented a\n\"complementary indictment\" in relation to the Taba bombings in which the First Victim had been charged\n(Case No. 40/2005).\n27. The Complainants state that the Second Victim also retracted his \"confessions\" before the court on 26\nMarch 2006 when he informed the court that he had been tortured during his detention. The Complainants\nsay that the court granted the Second Victim's request for a medical examination which took place two\nmonths later, nine months after the second victim's alleged torture. They state that the forensic medical\nreport, dated 27 May 2006, noted \"darker intersecting discolorations all over the back\" as well as an\nunhealed fracture in one of the toes of his left foot. The Complainants submit that despite the findings, the\nReport concluded that, due to the time lapse, it was not possible to determine precisely the cause or date7\nof the discolorations.\n28. The Complainants state that the Third Victim, Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer, was detained on 28\nSeptember 2005 under an Administrative Detention Decree issued under the Emergency Law.\n29. According to the Complainants, the period of their arrest was between 12 August and 28 September\n2005. The Complainants submit that the Third Victim was first interrogated by the State Security Prosecutor\non 20 November 2005, 50 days after his arrest, at which point he was informed of the charges against him.\n30. They state that on 25 March 2006 the Third Victim was referred to the Supreme State Security\nEmergency Court, as a result of the referral of the complementary indictment by the State Security\nProsecutor.\n31. They state that he had not been brought before a judge at any point during his six-month period of\npre-trial detention. According to the Complainants, he too was held in incommunicado detention without\naccess to family members, lawyers or medical care.\n32. The Complainants state that all the victims informed the court during the trial that they were subjected\nto beatings, electric shocks and different forms of cruel and degrading treatment, and that their requests for\nreferral to the Forensic Medical Authority were consistently denied by the Prosecution Office, but on a\nreferral by the court the examination confirmed the presence of several injuries but was unable to decisively\nconclude the cause of injuries due to the long period of time that had elapsed.\n33. The Complainants allege that the repeated requests of the victims to obtain official copies of the\ntranscript of the hearing of the trial were reportedly denied by the court.\n34. The Complainants aver that despite the obvious anomaly of the trial of the Victims and the objections\nraised by the defence with respect to procedural impropriety, the court proceeded with the trial and\nadjourned on September 2006 to 30 November 2006 to seek the Mufti's (Religious Adviser's) view on the\nproceedings in order to deliver its judgement. They state that according to Article 381 of the Criminal\nProcedure Code, the court is only obliged to seek the Mufti's view when it intends to issue a death\nsentence, indicating that the court had already reached verdict to sentence the Victims to death.\n35. According to the Complainants the victims were charged with; belonging to a group established in\nviolation of the provisions of the law and with the intention of flouting the provisions of the constitution and\nthe relevant laws as well as violating personal freedoms and targeting foreign tourists and the police as well\nas tourist installations; premeditated murder, attempted premeditated murder, damaging property, illegal\nmanufacture and possession of explosives and car robbery.\n\nArticles alleged to have been violated\n36. The Complainants submit that the rights of the victims under Articles 4, 5, 7 (1) (a), (c) and 26 of the\nAfrican Charter have been violated.\nPrayers\n37. The Complainants seek the following reliefs:\na. Recognition by the African Commission that the rights in the above mentioned articles in the Charter\nhave been violated;\nb. An order for compensation in respect of the violations of the rights of the victims;\nc. Harmonisation of the Respondent State's legislations in line with the Guidelines and Principles of the\nRights to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance adopted by the African Commission;\nd. Ensure that the appropriate mechanisms are implemented to avoid the reoccurrence of similar human\nrights violations.\n3\n\n\fProcedure\n38. The Complaint was received at the Secretariat of the African Commission on Human and Peoples'\nRights (the Secretariat) during the Commission's 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November\n2006, in Banjul, The Gambia. A provisional measure was requested to be taken under Rule 111 of the\nAfrican Commission's Rules of Procedure.\n39. The African Commission decided to be seized of the communication at its 40th Ordinary Session, held\nfrom 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul, The Gambia.\n40. The African Commission requested for provisional measures under Rule 111(1) of its Rules of\nProcedure, via a letter dated 5 December 2006 addressed to the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n41. By letter dated 21 December 2006, the Complainants were informed that the African Commission had\ndecided at its 40th Ordinary Session to be seized of the communication and that a request for Provisional\nMeasures had been sent to the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and requested the Complainants\nto send their submissions on admissibility to the Secretariat by 21 march 2007.\n42. By Note Verbale dated 21 December 2006, the African Commission informed the Respondent State its\ndecision to be seized of the communication and brought to the attention of the Government to the request\nfor provisional measures that was previously sent, and requested that the submissions on admissibility of\nthe Respondent State be sent to the Secretariat by 21 March 2007.\n43. On 22 March 2007, the Secretariat received the submissions on admissibility of the Complainants.\n44. On 23 March 2007, the Secretariat received the submission on admissibility of the Respondent State in\nArabic language.\n45. By Note Verbale and letter dated 29 March 2007, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the\nsubmissions on admissibility of both parties and forwarded the submission to the other party.\n46. By letter dated 19 April 2007, the Secretariat transmitted to the Complainants the translated version\n(from Arabic to English) of the Respondent State's submissions on admissibility.\n47. By letter dated 20 April 2007, the Complainants acknowledged receipt of the African Commission's\nletter dated 19 April 2007, but informed the Secretariat that it had not received the previous letter dated 29\nMarch 2007 by which the submissions on admissibility in original Arabic language were forwarded.\n48. On 20 April 2007, the Secretariat forwarded again the original Arabic version of the Respondent State's\nsubmissions on admissibility to the Complainants.\n49. During its 41st Ordinary Session, held from 16 to 30 May 2007 in Accra, Ghana, both parties made oral\nsubmissions before the African Commission to clarify on their written submissions on the admissibility of\nthe communication. The representative of the Respondent State also submitted in writing what was\npresented orally before the Commission on this occasion and this document was added to the file.\n50. At its 41st Ordinary Session, held from 16 to 30 May 2007 in Accra, Ghana, the Commission declared\nthe communication admissible.\n51. By Note Verbale dated 8 June 2007, the Secretariat informed the Respondent State of its decision on\nadmissibility; the Complainants were also informed in a letter dated 6 June 2007. Both parties were invited\nto make their submission on the merits.\n52. On 7 June 2007, the Secretariat received from the Complainants a letter addressed to the Chairperson\nrequesting for renewal of the Provisional Measures under Rule 111(1).\n53. By letter dated 7 June 2007 addressed to H.E. President Hosni Moubarak, a request for provisional\nmeasures was made by the Commission.\n54. On 24th October 2007, the Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt to Dakar, Senegal, sent a Note\nVerbal to inquire about the submission if any, made by Complainants.\n55. At the 42nd Ordinary Session held in Brazzaville, Congo from 15 to 28 November 2007, the\nCommission deferred the communication to the 43rd Ordinary session so as to allow the parties to make\ntheir submissions on the merits. During that same Session, the Secretariat received a submission on the\nMerit from the Respondent State.\n56. By Note Verbale dated 20 March 2008 and letter dated 19 March 2008, the parties to the\ncommunication were informed that the 43rd Ordinary Session is scheduled to be held from 7 to 22 May\n2008 in Ezulwini, Swaziland.\n57. On 23 April 2008, the Secretariat received an electronic version of the submission on the merits from\nthe Complainants.\n\n4\n\n\f58. On 24 October 2008 the Secretariat transmitted to the Respondent State the submission on the merits\nof the Complainants.\n59. By letter dated 24 October 2008, the Complainants were informed that the 44th Ordinary Session will be\nheld in Abuja, Federal Republic of Nigeria from 10 to 24 November 2008.\n60. During the 44th Ordinary Session the African Commission considered the communication on the merits\nand deferred it to the 45th Ordinary Session scheduled to be held from 13 to 27 May 2009 in Banjul, The\nGambia.\n61. By Note Verbale and letter dated 19 December 2008, the Secretariat informed the parties of the\ndecision to defer the consideration on the Merit of the communication to the 45th Ordinary Session.\n62. By Note Verbale and a letter both dated 24 April 2009, the parties were reminded that the\ncommunication will be considered on the Merit at the 45th Ordinary Session to be held in Banjul, The\nGambia from 13-27 May 2009.\n63. By Note Verbale and letter dated 16 July 2009, the African Commission informed the parties of its\ndecision to defer the communication to the 46th Ordinary Session, scheduled to take place from 11 to 25\nNovember 2009.\n64. By Note Verbale and letter dated 20 December 2009, the African Commission informed parties of its\ndecision to defer consideration of this communication to the 47 Ordinary Session of the African\nCommission scheduled to take place from 12 to 26 May 2010.\n65. By Note Verbale and letter dated 11 June, the African Commission informed parties of its decision to\ndefer the communication to the 48th Ordinary Session scheduled to take place from 10 to 24 November\n2010.\n\nThe Law on Admissibility\nSubmissions of the Complainants on Admissibility\n\n66. The Complainants submit that all the criteria of Article 56 of the African Charter are satisfied and that\ntherefore, the communication should be declared admissible.\n67. On the issue of exhaustion of local remedies, the Complainants state that under the Emergency Law\n(Law No. 162 of 1958 as amended), the President may decide to commute the sentence, revoke the\njudgement, or order a retrial by another circuit of the State Security Emergency Court. They submit that in\nthe present case, the sentence imposed by the State Emergency Court on 30 November 2006 on the\nvictims becomes final once it has been ratified by the President of the Republic and that there is no judicial\nright to appeal the decision of the State Security Emergency Court.\n68. According to the Complainants, the President's decision under the Emergency Law is not judicial in\nnature and therefore it cannot be defined as an available remedy for the Complainants to pursue. They\ncompare the facts of the present communication to those of Constitutional Rights Project v Nigeria in which\nthe Commission described the power of the Governor to confirm or disallow the decision of a special\ntribunal in Nigeria as a \"discretionary, extraordinary remedy of a non-judicial nature\" and where it was\nfound that the Governor's decision was not a remedy of the nature that required exhaustion under Article\n56(5) of the African Charter. The Complainants also refer to Civil Liberties Organisation v Nigeria wherein\nit was found that in the absence of a judicial body to adjudicate on the Applicant's complaint, there was no\neffective remedy available.\n69. The Complainants further argue that the President's decision under the Emergency Law cannot be\nmade subject to any appeal. Therefore, they submit that the victims are left without any judicial right to\nappeal the decision of the State of Emergency Court.\nThe Respondent State's Submissions on Admissibility\n\n70. The Respondent State submits that the communication is inadmissible for two reasons: firstly, it was\nlodged before exhausting local means of redress as the sentence was not final; and secondly, the content\nof the communication is inaccurate.\n71. In terms of the second grounds the Respondent State submits that certain facts of the communication\nare false. It argues that the victims were given due process before and during the trial and that they had\naccess to lawyers during interrogations.\n5\n\n\f72. The Respondent State submits that the victims had access to a forensic doctor and were examined.\nThey further State that copies of court proceedings were made available to the victims and their lawyers\nand they were properly remanded by a court prior to the commencement of interrogations commenced.\n73. The Respondent State asserts that trial of the victims was fair and was conducted in public.\n74. On the issue of exhaustion of local remedies, the Respondent State submits in its written statement that\nthe judgment pronounced on 30 November 2006 by an Emergency Court is not final as it has not yet been\nendorsed.\n75. The Respondent State further explains that the Act No. 162 of 1958 stipulates that judgments by the\nState of Emergency Security Courts are only made final after being endorsed by the President of the\nRepublic (Article 42), and that the ratifying authorities may, in examining the judgment, mitigate the\nsentence, replace it by a more lenient punishment, rescind it or rescind part thereof or stop its\nimplementation or a part thereof (Article 14).\n76. In addition, the Respondent State points out that for endorsement, the law stipulates that all cases on\nwhich a ruling has been made must be examined by legal advisers assigned for this purpose to ascertain\nthat the proper procedure was followed.\n77. The Respondent State also submits that the law allows the person convicted to submit a written appeal\nto the Office of the Public Prosecutor.\n78. The Respondent State confirmed that the request for Provisional Measures sent by the Chairperson in\nDecember 2006 to suspend the execution of the death penalty sentence while the communication was\nbefore the Commission had been received, and further explained that the request was transmitted to the\nPresident of Egypt who considered it.\nThe Commission's Analysis on Admissibility\n79. The second ground submitted by the Respondent State pertains to the merits of the case and is not\nrelevant at the stage of admissibility.\n80. The admissibility of communications within the African Commission is governed by the requirements of\nArticle 56 of the African Charter which provides for seven requirements to be met before a communication\ncan be declared Admissible. If any of the requirements set out in this article are not met, the African\nCommission declares the communication Inadmissible, unless the Complainant provides sufficient\njustifications why any of the requirements could not be met.\n81. In the present communication, the Complainants claim that this communication fulfils all the\nrequirements of Article 56 of the African Charter. The Respondent State on the other hand submits that the\nComplainants have not fulfilled the requirements under Article 56(5) and as such, the African Commission\nshould declare the communication inadmissible. The Commission would thus analyze the arguments of\nboth parties based on the provisions of Article 56 of the Charter.\n82. Article 56(1) of the African Charter states that \"Communication relating to Human and Peoples' Rights...\nreceived by the Commission shall be considered if they indicate their authors even if the latter request\nanonymity...\" This communication is brought before the African Commission by the Egyptian Initiative for\nPersonal Rights and Interights, the Complainants, on behalf of the victims. In this communication, the\nauthors as well as the victims have been identified. The African Commission is therefore of the view that\nsub-article (1) of Article 56 has been complied with.\n83. Article 56(2) of the African Charter states that \"Communications...received by the Commission shall be\nconsidered if they are compatible with the Charter of the Organization of African Unity or with the present\nCharter.\" The present communication sets out that Articles 4, 5, 7(1) (a), and 26 of the African Charter have\nbeen violated. The communication is brought against the Arab Republic of Egypt a State Party to the\nAfrican Charter, and alleges violation of the rights of Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, Mohamed Abdallah\nAbu-Gareer and Ossama Mohamed Al-Nakhlawy who are in custody awaiting to be executed by the\nRespondent State. The African Commission therefore holds that the requirements under Article 56(2) have\nbeen fulfilled.\n84. Article 56(3) of the African Charter states that \"Communications ...received by the Commission shall be\nconsidered if they are not written in disparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned\nand its institutions or to the Organisation of African Unity (AU)\". The present communication is not written in\na disparaging or insulting language directed to the Respondent State, its institutions or the AU and for\nthese reasons the African Commission holds that the requirements of Article 56(3) have been complied\n6\n\n\fwith.\n85. Article 56(4) of the African Charter states that \"Communications relating to human and Peoples'\nRights... shall be considered if they are not based exclusively on news disseminated through the mass\nmedia\". There is no evidence in this communication indicating that the allegations contained therein are\nbased exclusively on news or news disseminated through the mass media. The Complainants submit that\nthe communication is based on eyewitness evidence, as well as documented reports, which they have\nsubmitted along with the communication as attachments. The Respondent State have not challenged this\nassertion. For these reasons, the African Commission holds that the requirements of Article 56(4) have\nbeen fulfilled.\n86. Article 56(5) of the African Charter states that \"Communications relating to human and Peoples'\nRights... shall be considered if they are sent after exhausting local remedies, if any, unless it is obvious that\nthis procedure is unduly prolonged\".\n87. The rationale of the local remedies rule both in the Charter and other international instruments is to\nensure that before proceedings are brought before an international body, the Respondent State concerned\nmust have had the opportunity to remedy the matters through its own local system. This prevents the\nCommission from acting as a court of first instance rather than a body of last resort. Three major criteria\ncould be deduced from the practice of the Commission in determining this rule, namely: the remedy must\nbe available, effective and sufficient.8\n88. The only issue at stake at this stage of admissibility in the present case is the one of the exhaustion of\nlocal remedies.\n89. It appears from the oral submissions of the Respondent State that there is no local remedy left for the\ncomplainants to exhaust. They argued that the decision of the State of Emergency Court has been\nexamined and confirmed by a legal adviser and the final procedure of endorsement (ratification by the\nPresident) of the decision of the State of Emergency Court what is a waiting. The outcome of these two\nprocedures did not change the decision of the State of Emergency Court.\n90. The fact that the endorsement of the Emergency Special Court in Egypt is of legal nature or not is not\nrelevant for the examination of the communication by the Commission at this stage, because what is at\nstake is whether there are other remedies available that the applicants did not resort to. The clarifications\nbrought before the Commission by the representatives of the Respondent State during the 41st Ordinary\nSession led to the conclusion that there were no other local remedies available for the Complainant to\nresort to. The endorsement process was completed and it was submitted by both parties that the\nComplainants had already used the appeal that was available to them by bringing their grievance to the\n\"judgment ratification office\" and that this remedy was unsuccessful.\n91. Most of the submissions made by the Respondent State and examined during the 41st Ordinary\nSession of the Commission refer to the notion of due process during the trial and would be examined at the\nmerits' stage. The respect of the rights of the Complainants is indeed a matter relevant at the merits stage\nand irrelevant at the admissibility stage.\n92. The African Commission in several communications held that the condition of exhaustion of local\nremedies \"should not constitute an unjustifiable impediment to access international remedies. Therefore,\nArticle 56(5) should be applied concomitantly with Article 7, which establishes and protect the right to fair\ntrial\"9 . To this extent the African Commission, in determining whether local remedies have been exhausted\ntakes into consideration the circumstances of each case, including the general context in which the formal\nremedies operate and the personal circumstances of the applicant.\"10\n93. In Communication No 250/2002 Zegveld v Eritrea11 , the African Commission confirmed that a\ndomestic remedy is considered effective if it offers a prospect of success, and sufficient or adequate if it is\ncapable of redressing the complaint.12 In Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara v The Gambia, the African\nCommission decided that the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also\nin practice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. In the instant case and\nconsistent with the jurisprudence of the Commission, there are no remedies remaining for the\nComplainants to pursue as they have no judicial right to appeal the decision of the State Security\nEmergency Court. What remains was for the President of the Republic to ratify the judgment to give force\nto it.\n94. Therefore, if the victim cannot turn to the judiciary of his country because of lack of an effective legal\nremedy to address his fear and concerns, local remedies would be considered to be unavailable to him.\n95. In the present case, the sentence imposed by the State Security Emergency Court on 30 November\n2006 on the Victims becomes final once it has been ratified by the President of the Respondent State.\n7\n\n\fUnder Article 14 of the Emergency Law (Law No. 162 of 1958 as amended), the President may decide to\ncommute the sentence, revoke the judgment, or order a retrial by another circuit of the State Security\nEmergency Court. The President's decision is discretionary and cannot be made subject to any appeal.\n96. The African Commission decided in Communication No. 60/91 Constitutional Rights Project v Nigeria13\nthat purely discretionary remedies of non judicial nature where \"the object of the remedy is to obtain a\nfavour and not to vindicate a right\" are not of the kind contemplated by Article 56(5). In this decision, the\nAfrican Commission described the power of the Governor to confirm or disallow the decision of a Special\nTribunal in Nigeria as a \"discretionary, extraordinary remedy of a non-judicial nature.\"14 The African\nCommission stated that the remedy was neither adequate nor effective because the Governor was under\n\"no obligation to decide according to legal principles\"15 and concluded that the Governor's decision was\ntherefore not a remedy of the nature that required exhaustion under Article 56(5) of the Charter.16 In\nCommunication No 87/93 Civil Liberties Organisation v Nigeria [sic] , the African Commission also found\nthat in the absence of a judicial body to adjudicate the applicant's complaints, there was no effective\nremedy to which the applicant could have recourse.17\n97. In the Instant matter, the clarifications by the Representatives of the Respondent State during the 41st\nOrdinary Session led the Commission to the conclusion that there were no other local remedies available\nfor the victims to resort to. The ratification process was completed and it has been submitted by both\nparties that the victims had already used the appeal that was available to them by bringing their grievance\nto the \"judgment ratification office\" and that this remedy has proved unsuccessful.\n98. The African Commission therefore concludes that since the decision of the court is not appealable by\nany other judicial authority, the Complainants have exhausted the requirements of Article 56(5) of the\nCharter.\n99. Article 56(6) of the African Charter states that \"Communications relating to human and Peoples'\nRights... shall be considered if they: are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies\nare exhausted, or from the date the Commission is seized with the matter\". The Complainant states that the\ncase has been decided by the State Security Emergency Court whose decision was awaiting the ratification\nby the President of the Republic. The Secretariat of the African Commission received this communication\nduring the Commission's 40th Ordinary Session, held from 15 to 29 November 2006, in Banjul The Gambia\nand acknowledged receipt by a letter dated 12 February 2007. The Charter does not provide for what\nconstitutes a reasonable time, for a Complainant to bring his/her Complaint before the Commission. The\nCommission has however dealt with this issue, on a case by case basis. The communication got to the\nCommission ten months after the decision of the State Security Emergency Court. The African Commission\nconsiders this to be a reasonable time, taking into consideration the complexities of getting a representation\nbefore an international body, and the challenges of communications system in Africa. The African\nCommission therefore holds that this provision has also been complied with.\n100. Article 56(7) of the African Charter states that \"Communications relating to human and Peoples'\nRights... shall be considered if they: do not deal with cases which have been settled by these states\ninvolved in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, or the Charter of the\nOrganisation of African Unity or the provisions of the present Charter.\" The Complainants state that this\ncommunication has not been settled by any international body and as such this requirement has been met.\nThe Respondent State did not object to Complainants assertion and there is no evidence before the\nCommission to show that the communication is being or has been settled by another international body.\nThe Commission therefore holds that the requirement set out in Article 56(7) has been fulfilled.\n101. Therefore, since all, under Article 56 have been met, the African Commission declares the\ncommunication Admissible and maintains the request for Provisional Measures communicated to the\nRespondent State on 5th December 2006, in order to prevent irreparable damages.\n102. Other submissions which are made by the Respondent State and examined during the 41st Ordinary\nSession of the Commission refer to the notion of due process during the trial and will be examined at the\nmerits stage.\nThe Merits\nThe Complainants' Submissions on the Merits\n\n103. The Complainants submit that the manner in which the Respondent State conducted the arrest,\ndetention, interrogation, trial and sentencing of the victims violates Articles 4, 5, 7 (1) (a), (c) and 26 of the\n8\n\n\fAfrican Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 5 (Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment)\n\n104. It is submitted by the Complainants that, the First Victim, Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, after his arrest on\n22 October 2004 was held incommunicado by SSI (State Security Intelligence) agents until March 2005.\nSSI agents blindfolded and bound him, and occasionally hung him from the ceiling by his arms and legs.\nAccording to the Complainants he was held in this condition for 96 days, being untied only during his\ninterrogation by the State Security Prosecutor. They also allege that the SSI agents applied electric shocks\nto several parts of his body. They further allege that this beatings and torture took place before and after his\ninterrogation sessions by state security prosecutors which started on 3 November 2004.\n105. The Complainants also submit that the First Victim initially denied involvement in the bombings but\ndue to the beatings and torture was compelled to change his plea and confessed on 4 November 2004.\nThey also submit that the First Victim was not allowed access to his family, lawyers, medical care until 24\nMarch 2005.\n106. The Complainants aver that the Second Victim, Ossama Mohamed Abdel-Ghani Al-Nakhlawy, who\nwas arrested on 12 August 2005, was tortured by SSI officers during the initial period of his detention and\nquestioning, includes the use of electric shocks, beatings and suspension from the roof in painful positions.\nThey further submit that, during the interrogation session which spanned over seven months, the Second\nVictim was denied access to his legal counsel.\n107. They submit on behalf of the Third Victim, Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer, that between 28 September\n2005 and 20 November 2005, he was questioned by SSI officers in at least twenty-five sessions and that\nhe was subjected to electric shocks and suspended by the hands and legs in painful positions.\n108. In arguing this case, the Complainants further refer to the African Commission's jurisprudence18 where\nit held that the prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment includes 'actions which cause\nserious physical or psychological suffering (or) humiliate the individual or force him or her to act against his\nor her will or conscience'.\n109. The African Commission was also referred to the absolute prohibition of torture and ill treatment as\ncontained in the Robben Island Guidelines19 and Hurilaws v Nigeria20 . They further contend that the\nabsolute character of the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment is recognized in other regional and\ninternational instruments including the RIG and CAT.21 The Complainants submit that even those\ninstruments which, in contrast to the African Charter, allow for some derogation during times of national\nemergency explicitly exclude from the scope of permissible derogation, inter alia, the provisions prohibiting\ntorture and ill-treatment.22 The Complainants argue that even the undoubted threat posed by terrorism, do\nnot affect in any way the absolute prohibition on torture.23\n110. The Complainants further argue that, because of the importance of the values it protects, and as\ninternational courts and bodies have recognized, the prohibition of torture has now evolved into a\nperemptory norm or jus cogens, reflecting that the prohibition has become one of the most fundamental\nstandards in the international community.24\n111. The Complainants submit that, not only is the Respondent State required to refrain from torture and\nill-treatment, but also that, it must take positive measures to effectively prevent and protect against it. They\nargue that, certain safeguards - such as access to counsel, courts and medical personnel, and the\ninadmissibility of evidence obtained through torture - are inherent aspects of the prohibition of torture and\nill-treatment. They further submit that where torture or ill-treatment does arise, the Respondent State is\nobliged to respond with effective investigation and remedial action. The importance of such measures they\nargue, lies firstly, in acting as a deterrent to the commission of torture and ill-treatment and, secondly, in\nensuring that where torture and other ill-treatment occurs, it is investigated and documented. The\nComplainants refer the African Commission to General Comment No. 2 of the Committee against Torture,\nwhich recognized judicial remedies and access to counsel and to medical assistance during detention as\n\"baseline\" guarantees which the state is obliged to respect in order to give effect to the obligation to prevent\nand protect against torture or ill-treatment.25\n112. The Complainants argue that under the African Charter, a parallel obligation to prevent torture or\nill-treatment derives from the undertaking given by the States Parties in Article 1 of the Charter \"to adopt\nlegislative or other measures to give effect\" to the rights contained in the Charter. The importance of such\nsafeguards, the Complainants argue, has been recognized by the African Commission in the Robben\nIsland Guidelines.26 The Complainants aver that, the Commission itself has noted that while \"punishment of\n9\n\n\fthe torturer is important, [...] preventive measures such as halting of incommunicado detention, effective\nremedies under a transparent, independent and efficient legal system, and ongoing investigations into\nallegations of torture\"27 are the best ways to deal with such atrocities.\n113. It is submitted by the Complainants that, the victims were subjected to torture and ill-treatment by state\nagents - members of the security forces - while they were in state custody. They argue that, the victims\nwere subjected to repeated electric shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging, binding and blindfolding aimed at\ntheir complete disorientation. They further state that, this treatment, which was inflicted by state officials on\nthe victims, which intended to elicit confessions and information, clearly meets the torture threshold.\n114. The Complainants also argue that, although the context of the victims incommunicado detention and\ninterrogation is such that available evidence is necessarily limited, the allegations of torture and\nill-treatment are supported by the victims' independent testimonies of similar ill-treatment. According to the\nComplainants, the fact that the victims were held incommunicado, hidden from the outside world during the\n6-9 months of pre-trial detention, and that access to medical professionals was persistently denied until\nduring trial itself is indicative of ill-treatment. They submit that, the irregular nature of the \"interrogation\"\nsessions which is also consistent with the decision to interrogate late at night is a form of ill-treatment.\n115. The Complainants submit that the Forensic Medical Report, following the examination of the first\nvictim on 5 July 2005, nearly nine months after his injuries were sustained, noted \"healings\" and \"dark\ndiscolorations\" on his right and left forearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint. The\nsecond report of the FMA of 27 May 2006, following examination of the second and third victims also nearly\nnine months after their torture, found that the Second victim had a \"darker intersecting discolorations\" all\nover his back, as well as an unhealed fracture in a left foot toe and that the third victim had dark\ndiscolorations in the chest, abdomen and upper arms. The Complainants concede that, in both cases the\ngovernment examiners concluded that the long time lapse between being examined and the injuries made\nit impossible to determine with certainty the reason, manner or time of such injuries.\"\n116. The Complainants aver that their allegations are consistent with reports of the systemic nature of\ntorture by security forces in Egypt in cases such as the present one. By referring the African Commission to\nthe 1996 findings into the use of torture in Egypt, in which it concluded that \"torture is systematically\npracticed by the security forces in Egypt, in particular by State Security Intelligence\",28 the Complainants\nargue that human rights mechanisms consistently point to widespread and systematic torture in places of\ndetention in Egypt. The Complainants also refer the African Commission to the decision of the Committee\nAgainst Torture which found that \"Egypt resorted to consistent and widespread use of torture against\ndetainees\" and that \"[r]isk of such treatment was particularly high in the case of detainees held for political\nand security reasons.\"29\n117. The Complainants aver that under international human rights law, when a person is injured in\ndetention or while under the control of security forces, there is a strong presumption that the person was\nsubjected to torture or ill-treatment. They argue that, it is incumbent on the state to provide a plausible\nexplanation of how the injuries were caused.30\n118. The Complainants also argue that, the Respondent State has failed to discharge this burden in that,\nthey made no attempt to give satisfactory explanation of how the injuries were sustained, or to take any\nsteps to investigate and address the surrounding circumstances. The Complainants contend further that,\nthe trial court did nothing to follow up on questions raised in the FMA reports or the victims' testimonies.\nThey also argue that the SSI officers who were called to testify against the defendants in court were not\nasked to confront a single question with regard to the alleged torture and ill-treatment. They submit that the\njudgment fails to mention, still less to address, the allegations of ill-treatment; and that the authorities have\ncontinuously failed to take any steps to investigate the allegations of ill-treatment or the questions raised by\nthe FMA reports.\n119. The Complainants also contend that the carrying out of a death sentence using a particular method of\nexecution may amount to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if the suffering caused in\nexecution of the sentence is excessive and goes beyond that strictly necessary. They further argue that\nwhere a death sentence has been imposed \"it must be carried out in such a way as to cause the least\npossible physical and mental suffering.\"31 This approach they submit was tested and applied in the case of\nNg v. Canada where it was found that the particular method of gas asphyxiation fell foul [sic] of it.32\n120. The Complainants submit that in the present case, the victims have been sentenced to death by\nhanging. Hanging, they contend, is a notoriously slow and painful means of execution. If carried out without\nappropriate attention to the weight of the person condemned, hanging can result either in slow and painful\nstrangulation, because the neck is not immediately broken by the drop, or, at the other extreme, in the\n10\n\n\fseparation of the head from the body. The risk of either possibility is not compatible with respect for the\ninherent dignity of the individual and the duty to minimize unnecessary suffering.\nAlleged Violation of Articles 7(1) and 26 (Right to Fair Trial and Independent Judiciary)\n\n121. The Complainants argue that the victims right to a fair trial was violated in that; (a) they were tried by a\ncourt that was not independent and impartial and whose decisions is not subject to appeal; (b) their right to\na counsel was not fully respected; (c) confessions made under torture or ill-treatment were used by the\ncourt, and\n122. The Complainants also submit that by virtue of Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter, the victims have\n\"the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal\". They also state that, the\nvictims were tried by an exceptional security court, which failed to meet the minimum guarantees of an\nindependent and impartial tribunal.\n123. The Complainants state that the requirement of impartiality in Article 7 of the Charter is complemented\nby Article 26 of the same which imposes on States Parties 'the duty to guarantee the independence of the\ncourts' in their respective territories. These obligations, they submit, are captured in the Commission's\nPrinciples and Guidelines on Fair Trial wherein the Commission inter alia stated that: 'judicial bodies shall\nbe established by law to have adjudicative functions to determine matters within their competence on the\nbasis of the rule of law and in accordance with proceedings conducted in the prescribed manner;33 there\nshould not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process nor shall decisions be\nsubject to revision except through judicial review;34 all judicial bodies shall be independent from the\nExecutive branch35 and the government shall respect that independence;36 the process of appointments to\njudicial bodies shall be transparent;37 the judicial body shall decide matters before it without any\nrestrictions, improper influence, inducements, pressure, threats or interference, direct or indirect, from any\nquarter or for any reason.38\n124. The Complainants aver that, not applying these fair trial principles stated above, to special tribunals,\nviolates Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter because their composition is at the discretion of the executive\nbranch. They also contend that the removal of cases from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and placing\nthem before an extension of the executive branch necessarily compromises their impartiality39 and that\n\"[the] very existence [of such special tribunals] constitutes a violation of the principles of impartiality and\nindependence of the judiciary.\"40\n125. The Complainants state that the above averments are founded on the jurisprudence of the African\nCommission and are equally reflected in broader international and comparative law approaches to the right\nto be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal. To support this position the Complainants refer the\nAfrican Commission to the jurisprudence and case law of other regional and international and human rights\nmechanisms. They argue that an interpretation of such a right under Article 14(1) of the ICCPR has been\ndeemed to be \"an absolute right that may suffer no exception,\"41 and that where the executive is able to\n'control or direct' the judiciary, the notion of an independent and impartial tribunal is violated.42 This\njurisprudence they submit has been followed by regional human rights treaty bodies such as the\nInter-American and European Courts of Human Rights, which have similarly held that special courts with\nclose ties to the executive branch violate provisions requiring an independent and impartial tribunal.43\n126. The Complainants state that the competence and procedures of the Supreme State Security\nEmergency Court, an Exceptional Court, which tried the victims fall far short of the above standards. They\nalso argue that the Supreme State Security Emergency Court was established by the Emergency Law as a\ntemporary court,44 although, like the Emergency Law itself, it has been in force continually since 1981. The\nEmergency Law gives the court the primary competence of ruling on crimes perpetrated in violation of\ndecrees issued by the President of the Republic in application of the Emergency Law,45 but the President\nof the Republic may also, at his/her discretion, refer any ordinary crime to the Supreme State Security\nEmergency Court.46 According to Presidential Decree 1/1981 regarding the referral of some crimes to\nEmergency State Security Courts, all felonies and misdemeanors against the government's security or\nrelated to explosives shall be referred to State Security Emergency Courts, established under the\nEmergency Law.\n127. It is further contended by the Complainant that the composition of the Supreme State Security\nEmergency Court, and the procedure for appointments to it, illustrate the lack of independence. They state\nthat while normally composed of three judges of the Court of Appeal,47 the President of the Republic may\norder that the Security Court be formed of three judges of the Court of Appeal and two officers of the\n11\n\n\farmy,48 or simply decide that it be formed of three military officers.49 Before appointing the judges and/or\nmilitary officers, the law provides that the President of the Republic shall seek the opinion of the respective\nMinister of Justice and the Minister of War.50\n128. The Complainants also argue that, the degree of control which the President of the Republic exercises\nover the composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the State Security Court is antithetical to\nthe notion of an independent and impartial judicial process because, the President, for example exercises\nthe following powers:\n? the President may suspend a case before it is submitted to Supreme State Security Emergency Court or\norder the temporary release of the accused person before referral of the case to the Supreme State\nSecurity Emergency Court;51\n?? decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency Court are final only when they're approved by the\nPresident of the Republic, and cannot thereafter be challenged before any other court in Egypt;52\n? the President of the Republic may commute, change, suspend or cancel such decisions. He may also\norder the release of defendants53 ; and or\n? order the retrial of the case before another court.54\n129. The Complainants further aver that, this lack of independence and impartiality of the Supreme State\nSecurity Emergency Court has been identified and criticized by the Human Rights Committee when it\nexpressed its 'alarm' at the fact that \"that Military Courts and State Security Courts have jurisdiction to try\ncivilians accused of terrorism although there are no guarantees of those Courts' independence and their\ndecisions are not subject to appeal before a higher Court.\"55\n130. With regards to the right to a counsel, as enshrined in Article 7(1) (c) of the African Charter, 56 the\nComplainants contend that this right which underpins several others, such as freedom from ill-treatment\nand the right to prepare a defense,57 should be observed during all stages of criminal prosecution\n\"including preliminary investigations in which evidence is taken, periods of administrative detention, trial\nand appeal proceedings.\"58 They submit that in proceedings relating to criminal charges, legal\nrepresentation is the \"best means of legal defence against infringements of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms\".59 They also argue that in cases involving capital punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused\nmust be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all stages of the proceedings\".60\n131. They refer the African Commission to its decision in the matter of Malawi African Association and\nOthers v. Mauritania,61 the Complainants submit that the right to counsel in Article 7 refers to the right to\ncounsel of the detainee or defendant's choice and argues that where the accused either had no access, or\nonly restricted or delayed access, to lawyers, there is a violation of Article 7(1) (c). They contend that this\nright guarantees the right to timely and confidential consultations with that counsel.62\n132. The Complainants further argue that although the European system has recognized that in certain\nexceptional circumstances it may be necessary to limit the right to counsel, such restrictions can only be\nallowed if they are no more than strictly necessary and do not hinder the fairness of the proceedings.63 The\nComplainants refer the African Commission to the case of Ocalan v. Turkey, where the court held inter alia\nthat the denial of access to a lawyer for ten days during interrogations, \"a situation where the rights of the\ndefence might well be irretrievably prejudiced\", interfered with the fairness of the proceedings and violated\nthe defendant's human rights.64\n133. In the instant matter, the Complainants state that none of the Victims had lawyers present at the\ncritical early interrogation stage. They argue that on 23 November 2004 a group of human rights lawyers\nsubmitted a specific request to the Public Prosecutor's Office (registered under number 16332) to legally\nrepresent a number of individuals, including the First Victim but received no response. They submit that the\nFirst Victim was denied representation at interrogations for a period of 5 months until 24 March 2005 and\nthe Second and Third Victims had no access to counsel until 26 March 2006, when they first appeared in\ncourt.\n134. The Complainants submit that, even at the beginning of the trial, all three victims were denied the\nopportunity to consult with counsel privately, in order to prepare their defence. They also submit that, the\nlawyer client communication took place through bars of the court room, in the presence of, and within\nearshot security officials. It is submitted that the complete denial of access to counsel before their\nappearance in court and the restrictive access thereafter, violated the right to counsel and the right to a\n12\n\n\fdefence under Article 7(1) (c).65\n135. With regards to the issue of the State Security Emergency Court's reliance on the \"confessions\" of the\nthree Victims, the Complainants submit that \"any confession or other evidence obtained by any form of\ncoercion or force may not be admitted as evidence or considered as probative of any fact at trial or in\nsentencing.\"66 They argue that \"any confession or admission obtained during incommunicado detention\nshall be considered to have been obtained by coercion.\"67 They further argue that any evidence and/or\nconfessions obtained through torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment cannot be used in judicial\nproceedings except for the purpose of prosecuting the act of torture or ill-treatment itself.68\n136. Relying on decisions from European Court of Human Rights69 , the Complainants aver that the use of\nevidence obtained under torture or ill-treatment in criminal proceedings raises serious issues as to the\nfairness of such proceedings. They contend that any incriminating evidence - whether in the form of a\nconfession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of treatment\nwhich can be characterized as torture should never be relied on as proof of the victim's guilt, irrespective of\nits probative value.\"70 They further submit that the Egyptian Constitution of 1971 also stipulates that \"if a\nconfession is proved to have been made by a person under any ...forms of duress or coercion, it shall be\nconsidered invalid and futile\".71\n137. The Complainants submit that although the Committee against Torture has affirmed in a number of\ncases that, \"it is for the author to demonstrate that the allegations are well founded\", 72 the duty is generally\non the state to prove that the confessions were freely obtained.73 In support of this view the Complainants\nrefer the Commission to observations of the Human Rights Committee that \"all allegations that statements\nof detainees have been obtained through coercion must lead to an investigation and such statements must\nnever be used as evidence, except as evidence of torture, and the burden of proof, in such cases, should\nnot be borne by the alleged victim.\"74 The African Commission was also referred to in the UN Report of the\nSpecial Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, who had\nnoted that \"[...] the applicant is only required to demonstrate that his or her allegations of torture are well\nfounded. This means that the burden of proof to ascertain whether or not statements invoked as evidence\nin any proceedings, including extradition proceedings, have been made as a result of torture shifts to the\nState, [sic]75\n138. The Complainants assert that the victims in this case all raised allegations of torture and ill-treatment\nand that these allegations are at least consistent with the circumstances of their case, such as the\nincommunicado nature of their detention and the reports of the FMA which, at a minimum, indicate a risk of\nill-treatment. The Complainants also state that despite these concerns, and the apparent inconsistency and\nunreliability of the evidence, the \"confessions\" were admitted as evidence and appear to have formed at\nleast part of the basis of their convictions and the imposition of the death penalty. The reliance on such\nevidence, they argue, violates Article 7 of the Charter.\n139. With regards to the right to appeal, the Complainants aver that Article 12 of the Egyptian Emergency\nLaw stipulates that \"It is not allowed in any form to appeal the decisions pronounced by State Security\nCourts.\" They argue that these laws, and its application in practice, violate Article 7(1) (a) of the Charter,\nwhich provides for 'the right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his\nfundamental rights as recognized and guaranteed by conventions, laws, regulations and customs in force.'\n140. The Complainants also submit that States Parties should guarantee the right to appeal as well as\nprovide for a genuine and timely review of the cases, including the facts and the law\",76 and that in extreme\ncases where life is at risk States Parties should take steps to make appeals mandatory especially in death\npenalty cases.77 The Complainants refer the Commission to its decisions in Law Office of Ghazi Suleiman\nv Sudan78 to highlight the importance of appeal rights in the Commission's jurisprudence, and to Civil\nLiberties Organization and Others v. Nigeria79 concerning the right to appeal in death penalty cases.\n141. As a result of the above, the Complainants submit that the court before which the victims were tried\nfailed to meet the criteria which the Commission has identified as essential for an independent and\nimpartial tribunal and urged the Commission to hold that the Arab Republic of Egypt has violated Articles 7\nand 26 of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violation of Article 4 (Right to Life)\n\n142. In support of the alleged violation of Article 4 of the African Charter, the Complainants contend that\nalthough the imposition of the death penalty is not per se unlawful under the Charter or broader\ninternational human rights law, certain circumstances, which are present in this case, will render it a breach\n13\n\n\fof the right to life. For the purposes of this instant case the Complainant argued that these special\ncircumstances would include situations where the sentence was passed without meeting the requirements\nof a fair trial set out in Article 7 of the African Charter; and where the death penalty is mandatory or\nautomatic, imposed by law rather than being applied by a court of law in light of all relevant circumstances.\n143. They submit that in criminal proceedings which may lead to the imposition of the death penalty,\nrespect for due process is required to ensure that the right to life guaranteed under Article 4 of the Charter\nis not violated. By referring the African Commission to its decisions in International Pen and Others (on\nbehalf of Saro-Wiwa) v Nigeria80 and in Malawi African Association and Others v Mauritania, they argue\nthat, where the death penalty is unlawfully imposed, Article 4 is violated because the victims' rights under\nArticle 7 of the Charter had been denied.\n144. The Complainants submit that 'a higher threshold of rights is intended for those who are charged with\ncrimes the sentence of which might be the death penalty'81 , which explains the need for \"scrupulous\nrespect of the guarantees of fair trial\" in capital offence cases.82 It is submitted that the Respondent State in\na statement to the UN General Assembly in 2007 recognized the critical nature of respect for due process\nrights in capital offence cases.83\n145. It is contended by the Complainants that the imposition of the death sentence by the Supreme State\nSecurity Emergency Court in the particular circumstances of this case would amount to an arbitrary\ndeprivation of life.\nThe Respondent State's Submissions on the Merits\n\n146. Concerning the alleged violation of Article 5, the Respondent State submits that Article 42\n× Article 42 Any person arrested, detained or his freedom restricted shall be treated in the manner\nconcomitant with the preservation of his dignity. No physical or moral harm is to be inflicted upon him. He\nmay not be detained or imprisoned except in places defined by laws organising prisons. If a confession is\nproved to have been made by a person under any of the aforementioned forms of duress or coercion, it\nshall be considered invalid and futile.\nof the Constitution of Egypt provides for and guarantees the right to security of the person and that if a\nconfession is proved to have been made by a person under duress or coercion, it shall be considered\ninvalid and futile. It is further submitted by the Respondent State that Article 57\n× of the same Constitution provides that \"any assault on individual freedom or on the inviolability of the\nprivate life of citizens and any other public rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and Article 57\nAny assault on individual freedom or on the inviolability of private life of citizens and any other public rights\nand liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and the law shall be considered a crime, whose criminal and\ncivil lawsuit is not liable to prescription. The State shall grant a fair compensation to the victim of such an\nassault.\nthe law shall be considered a crime, whose criminal and civil lawsuit is not liable to prescription. The State\nshall grant a fair compensation to the victim of such an assault.\"\n147. Concerning the allegation that the victims were denied visits while in detention, the Respondent State\nsubmit that the relatives of Ossama Mohamed al- Nakhlawy visited him 17 times, the relatives of Mohamed\nGayez Sabah visited him 30 times and the relatives of Yunis Mohamed Abu Gareer visited him 16 times\nuntil April 2007. These, argues the Respondent State shows that the allegations of the Complainants are\nbaseless.\n148. The Respondent State avers that its penal code criminalizes acts of torture in Articles 126 and 282,\nand that the same code further criminalizes unjustified detention imposes penalties exceeding those\ndecided by Articles 127 and 280.\n149. The Respondent State contends that, the assessment, value and reliance on any confession as a\npiece of evidence in any criminal proceedings is an issue entirely at the discretion of the Court. It is argued\nthat it is the judge who in exercise of this discretion decides whether or not to accept and rely on the\nconfession as reliable evidence for conviction.\n150. It is contended by the Respondent State that the judge's competence to assess the value of a\nconfession entails as well his competence to interpret it, define its significance and explore its motives. This\nprinciple, argues the Respondent State, applies whether the confession was judicial or non judicial, whether\nit took place in the process of factual investigation, interrogation or even before a normal person. The\njudge, argues the Respondent State, does not rely on a confession if he is not convinced with it even in the\n14\n\n\fcase where the accused person insists on his confession. In such a case, the judge may issue an acquittal\nand clarify in the causation why he did not take the confession into consideration. If it is proved that the\nconfession was made under duress or coercion, it would be considered as invalid. But this does not prevent\nthe court from taking other evidences to prove the accusation.\n151. It is argued by the Respondent State that the court judgment against the victims took into\nconsideration all the circumstances related to the facts according to the satisfaction of the court based upon\nthe processes in the case, the investigations, the court sessions and the related hearings of witnesses and\nthe written and verbal pleadings of the defence in order to clarify the facts, the elements of the crime and\nthe provisions of the law applicable thereon. The Respondent State argues that the court considered,\nscrutinized and analyzed all the evidences of the subject matter of the complaint including the related\nmedical and technical reports and the public prosecution investigations to reach the facts upon which its\njudgment was established.\n152. It is further contended by the Respondent State that the court responded to all the pleas of the\ndefence during the trial including the plea of the invalidity of the confessions, and that the court was\nsatisfied that the confessions of the victims and the other accused persons during the investigation were\nmade by persons who have the will and the discernment and are fully aware of the charges against them.\n153. The Respondent State submits that when the accused persons first appeared before the public\nprosecutor they were free from any injuries. They further submit that the court was certain that the victims\nwere fully aware that the investigations were made by the Public Prosecution Office (PPO) and that the\nPPO had informed them of the charges against them. The Respondent State also stated that 'the Office of\nthe Public Prosecutor in carrying out its investigations, interrogated the accused, Mohamed Gaiz Sabah in\nfour sessions, Osama Abdel Ghani El-Nakhlawi in eight sessions and Mohamed Alyan Abu Garir in twenty\nfive sessions. During these sessions, all the accused pleaded guilty of having committed the crimes\nattributed to them'.\n154. The Respondent State contends that as a result of the findings of the PPO, the victims were referred\nto Court in suit number No. 40/2005 of breaching security under the State of Emergency by committing\ncapital offence. The Court, the Respondent State contends, had responded throughout its sittings to all the\nrequests made by the victims. They also submit that the Court had during deliberations allowed the victims\nand their defence to produce evidence in support of their case and to bring their own to witnesses. They\nfurther submit that the Complainants were heard and that their request to be examined by a forensic doctor\nwas also granted. They submit that the court equally heard the Complainants submissions in defence of the\nvictims in 12 sessions and that they were allowed access to visit victims whenever they requested. They\nalso submit that the Complainants were given copies of the minutes of investigations and all the records of\ncourt sittings as well as the witnesses and that the court was convinced that their confessions were valid.\n155. Concerning the Complainants' allegation that the fair trial rights of the victims were violated, the\nRespondent State adopted its earlier position that the victims had a fair and just trial before a legal, national\nand competent court. They submit that the trial sessions were public and were attended by the lawyers who\nrepresented the victims; and that, the trial was concluded within a reasonable period.\n156. The Respondent State argues that it is clear from the court processes that the victims were tried\nbefore a legal, national and independent court constituted of judges who enjoy judicial immunity. This\naccording to the Respondent State negates the allegation of a any violation of Article 26 of the African\nCharter.\n\nThe African Commission's Analysis on the Merits\n157. In this communication, the African Commission is called upon to determine whether the arrest, pre-trial\ndetention, trial and sentencing of the Victims by the Respondent State following their alleged involvement in\na bomb attack on 6 October 2004, in the Taba and Noueiba' resorts of the Sinai Peninsula which led to the\ndeath of 34 and the injury of 105 Egyptian, Israeli and other foreigners, violates the victims' rights\nguaranteed under Articles 4, 5, 7(1) (a)(c) and 26 of the African Charter as alleged by the Complainants.\nThe summary of the rights allegedly violated by the Respondent State are viz:\n\n? The torture of the victims while in State custody, including electrical shocks, beatings, hanging from their\nhands and legs and prolonged sensory deprivation violates the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or\n15\n\n\fdegrading treatment enshrined in Article 5 of the Charter;\n\n? The denial of essential safeguards necessary to give effect to that prohibition, such as access to counsel,\ncourts and medical personnel, and the use in court of evidence obtained through torture, themselves\namount to a violation of Article 5 of the Charter;\n\n? The character, procedures and conduct of the Office of the State Security Prosecutor and of the Supreme\nState Security Emergency Court violate the victims' rights to due process under Article 7(1) of the Charter\nand the State's obligations to ensure the independence of the courts under Article 26;\n\n? The denial of fair trial rights and the imposition of the death penalty which would constitute a breach of\nthe right to life, as protected by Article 4 and 5 of the Charter.\n158. The Commission will accordingly proceed to analyze each of the Articles of the Charter alleged to\nhave been violated by the Respondent State\nAlleged Violation of Article 5\n\n159. The Complainants submit that the Respondent State violated Article 5 in that, the Victims were held\nincommunicado and denied access to their families, lawyers and medical care by SSI agents. They State\nthat they were beaten, tortured, blindfolded and occasionally hung from the ceiling by their arms and legs in\npainful positions by SSI agents who applied electrical shocks to several parts of their bodies.\n160. Article 5 of the African Charter, reads, \"Every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity\ninherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status. All forms of exploitation and\ndegradation particularly slavery, slave trade, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and\ntreatment shall be prohibited.\nArticle 42 of the 1971 Constitution of Egypt stipulates that:\n\"any citizen arrested, detained or whose freedom is restricted shall be treated in a manner concomitant with\nthe preservation of his dignity. No physical or moral harm is to be inflicted upon him...\"84\n161. In order to analyse the allegation of torture by the Victims, the African Commission will look at what\namounts to torture in accordance with the Charter and other international instruments. Article 60 of the\nCharter has drawn inspiration from broader international law to deal with specific issues. Substantive\ninternational jurisprudence and practice has therefore developed in recent years regarding the nature of the\nprohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and the obligations of states to protect its\ncitizens against such treatment.\n162. Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel or Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (CAT) has defined\ntorture as: \"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted\non a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession,\npunishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or\nintimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when\nsuch pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public\nofficial or other person acting in an official capacity.\"85\n163. The African Commission will now seek to address issues as outlined in the submissions of the\nComplainants viz:\n(a) the Arab Republic of Egypt, through its State Security Intelligence force tortured and/or ill-treated the\nvictims; (b) the State, through its intelligence services, prosecutor's office and security court, denied the\nVictims the essential safeguards against torture and ill-treatment, including prompt access to counsel, to a\ncourt and to medical personnel, and has permitted the admissibility of \"confessions\" obtained through\ntorture in proceedings against them. (c) the State has failed to conduct an effective investigation into these\n16\n\n\falleged acts of torture and ill-treatment and no diligent attempts have been made to hold anyone to\naccount.\n164. The facts of torture as contained in the complaints is that the SSI agents subjected the victims to\nrepeated electrical shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging by the leg, binding and blindfolding aimed at their\ncomplete disorientation.\n165. The Respondent State on the other hand submit that the investigations carried out by the Public\nProsecutor established that it has conducted external check on the accused persons immediately when\nthey were brought before it and that it was confirmed that they were free from any external injuries. The\nquestion therefore that would follow is, who then inflicted the injuries that were subsequently found on the\nvictims?\n166. The victims' allegation is also consistent with the forensic reports which were eventually issued for\neach of the victims. The FMA report, following the examination of the First Victim on 5 July 2005, nearly\nnine months after his injuries were sustained, noted \"healings\" and \"dark discolorations\" on his right and left\nforearms, right elbow, left thigh, upper left leg and left hip joint. The Second Report of the FMA of 27 May\n2006, following examination of the Second and Third Victim also nearly nine months after their torture,\nfound that the Second Victim had a \"darker intersecting discolorations\" all over his back, as well as an\nunhealed fracture in a left foot toe and that the Third Victim had dark discolorations in the chest, abdomen\nand upper arms.86 However, in both cases the government examiners concluded that the long time lapse\nbetween being examined and the injuries made it impossible to determine with certainty the reason,\nmanner or time of such injuries.\"87\n167. The question therefore that begs the mind is who then is responsible for the dark colorations found on\nthe bodies of the Victims? Certainly this could not have been inflicted by the Victims themselves, especially\nwhen it has been established that during all this time they were under the custody of the Respondent\nState's agents.\n168. It is a well established principle of international human rights law, that when a person is injured in\ndetention or while under the control of security forces, there is a strong presumption that the person was\nsubjected to torture or ill-treatment. As the European Court of Human Rights has recently noted: Where a\nperson is injured while in detention or otherwise under the control of the police, any such injury will give rise\nto a strong presumption that the person was subjected to ill-treatment [...]. It is incumbent on the State to\nprovide a plausible explanation of how the injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under\nArticle 3 of the Convention [...].88\n169. The African Commission wishes to state that under such circumstance, the burden now shifts to the\nRespondent State to convince this Commission that the allegations of torture raised by the Complainants is\nunfounded. The context of the Victims incommunicado detention and interrogation is such that available\nevidence is necessarily limited. However, the allegations of torture and ill-treatment are supported by the\nvictim's independent testimonies of similar ill-treatment. Their allegations fit also with the fact that they were\nheld incommunicado, hidden from the outside world during the 6-9 months of pre-trial detention, and that\naccess to medical professionals was persistently denied until during trial itself.\n170. In the present case, the Respondent State has made no attempt to give a satisfactory explanation of\nhow the injuries were sustained, or to take any steps to investigate and address the surrounding\ncircumstances. The trial court did nothing to follow up on questions raised in the FMA reports or the Victims'\ntestimonies.\n171. In the light of the above the African Commission concludes that the marks on the victims evidencing\nthe use of torture could only have been inflicted by the Respondent State.\n172. On the right to medical services, during detention, the African Commission and other international\nbodies have recognized and emphasizes that such rights be provided \"promptly\". The Human Rights\nCommittee, in its General Comment No. 20, has observed that protection of the detainee from torture and\nill-treatment requires \"prompt and regular access\" to doctors.89 The General Assembly has repeatedly\nunderlined the importance of the right to prompt medical examination promptly following detention to\nprevent abuse of detainees.\n173. In the presence of allegations or possible indications of abuse, the importance of prompt access to\nmedical personnel becomes all the more critical. The Istanbul Protocol, a set of detailed guidelines on the\ninvestigation of torture and ill-treatment elaborated by an independent group of experts in 1999, recalls that\n\"[t]he investigator should arrange for a medical examination of the alleged victim. The timeliness of such\nmedical examination is particularly important. A medical examination should be undertaken regardless of\nthe length of time since the torture, but if it is alleged to have happened within the past six weeks, such an\n17\n\n\fexamination should be arranged urgently before acute signs fade.\"90\n174. The Robben Island Guidelines in its section 20, urges State Parties to make sure that \"all persons\nwho are deprived of their liberty by public prder or authority should have that detention controlled by\nproperly and legally constituted regulations. Such regulations should provide a number of basic safeguard,\nall of which shall apply from the moment when they are first deprived of their liberty. These include:\na) The right that a relative or relative or other appropriate third person is notified of the detention;\nb) The right to an independent medical examination;\nc) The right of access to a lawyer; and\nd) Notification of the above rights in a language which the person deprived of their liberty understand. [sic]\n175. In the present case, the victims were not examined by doctors at any point during their pre-trial\ndetention. Even when they reported their torture and ill-treatment, they were still denied access to medical\npersonnel by the authorities.\n176. Only when the allegations of torture were made for the second time during the trial itself did the Judge\norder the examination of the Victims by the FMA. The forensic examination conducted by the authorities\nplainly did not satisfy the obligations set out above, as it was carried out more than 6 months after the\nVictims complained that they were subjected to torture and ill-treatment and was, therefore, ineffectual as a\nmethod of prevention or investigation.\n177. The African Commission therefore holds that the failure by the Respondent State to provide prompt\nmedical services to the victims whiles they were under detention violates the victims' rights to prompt\nmedical services whiles under custody.\n178. The African Commission also notes that the victims were denied counsel during their detention,\nincluding the critical interrogation sessions. In the Jamaican Case of Osbourne Wright and Eric Harvey v.\nJamaica, adopted on 27 October 1995, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has held that the\nrequirement that legal assistance must be made available to an accused faced with a capital crimes applies\nnot only to the trail and relevant appeals, but also to any preliminary hearing relating to the case.\n179. The African commission, therefore, notes that there is no disputed that the victims were unrepresented\nat the preliminary investigation stage, and notwithstanding the Respondents State's assertion that it is not\nthe responsibility of the State authorities to pay for such legal aid, it finds that it is axiomatic that legal\nassistance be available in capital cases, at all stages of the proceedings, especially when there were\nrequest from human rights lawyers to represent the victims. It should be understood by the Respondent\nState that there a positive obligation on them to provide access to independent legal assistance under the\nCharter, inherent in the international prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. The African Commission has\nrecognized the right to access to a lawyer as one of the \"basic procedural safeguards for those deprived of\ntheir liberty\"91 and as one of the necessary safeguards against abuse during the pre-trial process.92\n180. The link between the prevention of torture and the right to prompt access to a lawyer has likewise\nbeen emphasised by other international human rights bodies. In its Resolution 61/153 of 2007, reaffirming\nthe UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment,\nthe General Assembly stressed that permitting prompt and regular access to legal counsel constitutes an\n\"effective measure [...] for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and\npunishment.\"93 Similarly, the Human Rights Committee has stated that the protection of detainees from\ntorture and ill-treatment \"requires that prompt and regular access be given to [...] lawyers\"94 and that the\nuse of prolonged detention without any access to a lawyer violates a number of provisions of the Covenant,\nincluding Article 7.95\n181. Human rights bodies have thus recognized that, for access to a lawyer to constitute an effective\nprotection against torture and ill-treatment, such access has to be \"prompt\" and regular.96 For example the\nHuman Rights Committee has recommended \"that no one is held for more than 48 hours without access to\na lawyer\",97 whilst the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has clarified that \"[l]egal provisions prescribing\nthat a person shall be given access to a lawyer not later than 24 hours after he has been arrested usually\nfunction as an effective remedy against torture, provided compliance with such provisions is strictly\nmonitored.\"98\n182. Further, the right is to have access to a lawyer of one's choice, as recognized for instance in the UN\nBasic Principles on the Role of Lawyers.99 For the right to counsel to be meaningful it must also comprise\nthe right to timely, effective and confidentially communicate with counsel.\n183. In the instant matter, the obligation to permit access to counsel or independent legal advice was\nbreached, as detailed above. The African Commission is convinced that the Victims were not given access\n18\n\n\fduring the critical early stage of detention, including interrogation sessions, when there is the greatest risk\nof torture and ill-treatment. The African Commission's view is that right of a detainee to have prompt\nrecourse to a court is established as a matter of international law. It constitutes a vital aspect of the\nprevention and deterrence of torture and other ill-treatment.\n184. In this regard it is worth mentioning that in the Robben Island Guidelines, the African Commission has\nrecognized that the right to be brought promptly before a judicial authority constitutes an essential\nsafeguard against torture and ill-treatment,100 In its General Comment No. 2, the Committee Against\nTorture expressed the view that the obligation to take measures to ensure the effective prevention of torture\nimplied a requirement that States should ensure \"the availability to detainees and persons at risk of torture\nand ill-treatment of judicial and other remedies that will allow them to have their complaint promptly and\nimpartially examined, to defend their rights, and to challenge the legality of their detention or treatment.\"101\n185. This approach has been repeatedly endorsed by the General Assembly,102 and finds further support in\nthe jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.103\n186. As one of the inherent aspects of the protection of detainees from torture and ill-treatment, judicial\noversight of detention applies at all times, including times of national emergency, as noted by the\nInter-American Court:\n\"[...] even in emergency situations, the writ of habeas corpus may not be suspended or rendered\nineffective. [...] the immediate aim of this remedy is to bring the detainee before a judge, thus enabling the\nlatter to verify whether the detainee is still alive and whether or not he or she has been subjected to torture\nor physical or psychological abuse. The importance of this remedy cannot be overstated, considering that\nthe right to humane treatment recognized in Article 5 of the American Convention on Human Rights is one\nof the rights that may not be suspended under any circumstances.\"104\n187. In this case the Respondent States' obligation to bring the victims promptly to an independent judicial\nauthority was breached. While they did appear before a prosecutor, the right guaranteed in law is to bring\nthem before a judicial authority that is independent of the authorities detaining, interrogating and ultimately\nprosecuting them. They also had no meaningful opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of their detention,\ndue to lack of access to a court and to lawyers. Article 3 of the Emergency Law 50/1982 as amended,\nstipulates that detainees or their representatives may appeal their arrest or detention orders within 30 days\nafter the orders are issued. However, in practice detainees often have little access to the appeal provided\nfor in law. The victims had no access to lawyers neither were they arraigned before a competent court\nduring to properly remand them to custody\n188. The Respondent State, while arguing that the victims were allowed access to their families, failed to\nchallenge in specific terms the allegations that they were refused access to medical care. The allegation of\ntorture and more particularly the particulars of injuries sustained by the Victims as contained in the Forensic\nMedical Reports were never challenged by the Respondent State.\n189. The Respondent State has not refuted the allegations of torture or the harsh treatment to which the\nvictims were subjected to. The African Commission has in many of its decisions held that facts uncontested\nby the Respondent State shall be considered as established.105 The fact that the victims were subjected to\nrepeated electric shocks, beatings, prolonged hanging, binding and blindfolding and denied access to\nmedical care violates their physical and psychological integrity. There was also no evidence whatsoever\npointing to violent action from the victims themselves nor has there been any reported escape attempt by\nthe victims to warrant holding them in such degrading and inhuman manner.\n190. Article 5 prohibits not only torture, but also cruel inhuman or degrading treatment. This includes not\nonly actions which cause serious physical or psychological suffering, but which humiliate the individual or\nforce him or her against his or her will or conscience. The African Commission therefore holds that the\naction of the Respondent State constitutes a multiple violation of Article 5 of the African Charter.\nAlleged Violations of Article 7 and 26\n\n191. The Complainants contend that the victims right to fair trial were violated in that;\n? they were tried by a Court that was not independent and impartial and whose decisions cannot be\nappealed;\n? their right to a counsel was not fully respected;\n19\n\n\f? confessions made under torture or ill-treatment were used by the Court; and\n? they were denied the right of appeal.\n192. The essential question that must be asked here is whether the trial of the Victims complied with the\nprovisions of Articles 7(1) and 26 of the African Charter.\n193. Article 7 of the African Charter provides that: \"Every individual shall have the right to have his cause\nheard. This comprises:\na) The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental rights as\nrecognized and guaranteed by the conventions, laws, regulations, and customs in force;\nb) The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court or tribunal;\nc) The right to defence, including the right to be defended by counsel of his choice;\nd) The right to be tried within a reasonable time by an impartial court or tribunal.\n194. Article 26 on its part provides that: 'States Parties to the present Charter shall have the duty to\nguarantee the independence of the courts and shall allow the establishment and improvement of\nappropriate national institutions entrusted with the promotion and protection of the rights and freedoms\nguaranteed by the present Charter'.\n195. A combined reading of Articles 7 and 26 brings to the fore two core issues - having access to\nappropriate justice and the other relating to the independence of justice system. These two issues\nconstitute the bedrock of a sound justice delivery system. The African Commission believes that the right to\na fair trial is analogous with the concept of access to appropriate justice and requires that one's cause be\nheard by efficient and impartial courts106 .\n196. Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter enshrines \"the right to be tried within a reasonable time by an\nimpartial Court or tribunal.\" The requirement of impartiality in Article 7 is complemented by Article 26 of the\nAfrican Charter which imposes on States parties \"the duty to guarantee the independence of the Courts\" in\ntheir respective territories.\n197. These obligations are captured in the Commission's Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial where the\nCommission has expounded on what should be required for an independent and impartial tribunal. Among\nother criteria, the Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial state that:\n- judicial bodies shall be established by law to have adjudicative functions to determine matters within their\ncompetence on the basis of the rule of law and in accordance with proceedings conducted in the prescribed\nmanner;107\n- there should not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process nor shall\ndecisions be subject to revision except through judicial review;108\n- all judicial bodies shall be independent from the Executive branch109 and the government shall respect\nthat independence;110\n- the process of appointments to judicial bodies shall be transparent;111\n- the judicial body shall decide matters before it without any restrictions, improper influence, inducements,\npressure, threats or interference, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason.112\n198. Applying these fair trial principles to special tribunals, the African Commission has held that they\n\"violate Article 7(1) (d) of the African Charter because their composition is at the discretion of the executive\nbranch.\n199. The victims were tried before the Supreme State Security Emergency Court, whose competence and\nprocedures fall far short of the above standards. The Supreme State Security Emergency Court is an\nexceptional court. It was established by the Emergency Law as a temporary court,113 although, like the\nEmergency Law itself, it has been in force continually since 1981. The Emergency Law gives the Court the\nprimary competence of ruling on crimes perpetrated in violation of decrees issued by the President of the\nRepublic in application of the Emergency Law,114 but the President of the Republic may also, at his\ndiscretion, refer any ordinary crime to the Supreme State Security Emergency Court.115 According to\nPresidential Decree 1/1981 regarding the referral of some crimes to Emergency State Security Courts, all\n20\n\n\ffelonies and misdemeanours against the Government's security or related to explosives shall be referred to\nthe State Security Emergency Courts, established under the Emergency Law.\n200. In view of the above, the African Commission is of the view that the degree of control which the\nPresident of the Republic exercises over the composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the\nState Security Court is antithetical to the notion of an independent and impartial judicial process. The law\nitself provides, for example, for the President to exercise the following powers:\n? The President may suspend a case before it is submitted to Supreme State Security Emergency Court or\norder the temporary release of the accused person before referral of the case to the Supreme State\nSecurity Emergency Court.116\n? Decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency Court are final only when they're approved by the\nPresident of the Republic, and cannot thereafter be challenged before any other court in Egypt.117\n? The President of the Republic may commute, change, suspend or cancel such decisions. He may also\norder the release of defendants118 or order the retrial of the case before another court.119\n201. It most [sic] be pointed out that Supreme State Security Emergence Court is not part of the regular\ncriminal court structure in Egypt. Sentences passed by this court can only be reviewed by the office\nresponsible for ratifying its judgments, office of the President of the Republic who is also the ratifying\nauthority. The ratifying authority which is not a court of law, may mitigate the sentence or repeal it and,\nonce the sentences are upheld the convicts may only petition the President for an amnesty or mitigation in\naccordance with the provisions of Article 149\n× Article 149 The President of Republic shall have the right of granting amnesty or commute a sentence.\nAs for general amnesty, it can only be granted by virtue of a law.\nof the Constitution.\n202. The Respondent State, however, submitted that the State of Emergency Security Court which tried the\naccused persons is a prosecuting court with limited functions according to the law and the objective criteria.\nThey further asserted that membership of this court comprises three experts (Judges who are members of\nthe judiciary. They also state that the trials and procedures in this case and in stages and phases were\ncarried out in public and in accordance with the law. It further argued that the criteria of fair trial adopted by\nthe international agreements on human rights were observed, and therefore, it is obvious from the above\nand from the records of the proceedings of the court trials that two lawyers appeared during all the hearings\ntogether with the first and the second accused persons and four lawyers representing the third complainant.\n203. From the submissions of the Respondent State, the African Commission of the view that the\nRespondent State does not appreciate the importance of an independent tribunal, especially one that is\nresponsible for trying victims charged with capital offences. The African Commission therefore reiterates\nthat the essence of a higher tribunal is that, it affords the victims the opportunity to have their case\nre-examined on both law and facts by a judicial body. In this way the decision of the court below can be\ntested. The omission of the opportunity of such an appeal therefore greatly deprives the victims of due\nprocess.\n204. In this regard the African Commission also wishes to make reference to the UN Basic Principle on the\nIndependence of the Judiciary. Those principles provide that every one shall have the right to be tried by\nthe ordinary courts or tribunals using established procedures. Tribunals that do not use the duly established\nprocedures of the legal process shall not be created to displace the jurisdiction belonging to the ordinary\ncourts or judicial tribunals. Therefore, it is the view of the African Commission that a tribunal cannot be said\nto be independent when the implementation of its decision squarely vests on the executive branch of the\nGovernment, in this case the Head of State. This has completely defeated the criteria envisaged in a\ndemocratic state.\n205. In Civil Liberties Organisation, and Others v Nigeria120 , the African Commission held that 'the\nforeclosure of any avenue of appeal to competent 63 national organs in a criminal case attracting\npunishment as severe as the death penalty clearly violates Article 7(1) (a)'. The African Commission\nagrees with the Complainants that the fact that the decisions of the Supreme State Security Emergency\nCourts are not subject to appeal constitutes a de jure procedural irregularity and manifestly violates Article\n7(1) (a) of the African Charter.\n206. Therefore, the African Commission notes that in all cases, the independence of a court must be\njudged in relation to the degree of independence of the judiciary vis-?-vis the executive. This implies the\n21\n\n\fconsideration of the manner in which its members are appointed, the duration of their mandate, the\nexistence of protection against external pressures and the issue of real or perceived independence: as the\nsaying goes 'justice must not only be done: it must be seen to be done'.\n207. The African Commission is of the view that the degree of control which the President exercises over\nthe composition, conduct and outcome of proceedings before the State Security Court does not guarantee\nan independent and impartial judicial process. In its view that amounts to executive interference in the\njudicial process defeating the intent and purporse of Article 7(1) (d). The African Commission is therefore of\nthe view that the verdict of the Supreme State Security Emergency court did not offer guarantees of\nindependence, impartiality and equity and therefore constitutes a violation of the Article 7 of the African\nCharter.121\n208. In any event, it was the responsibility of the Respondent State to adduce sufficient evidence to rebut\nthe arguments that the court in its composition was independent and was capable of giving an impartial\nruling, and this the Respondent State has not done to the satisfaction of the African Commission. In the\nabsence of such rebuttal or facts that could convince the African Commission of the opposite view, it\ncannot invalidate the submission by the complainants regarding the inexistence of a fair justice system.\n209. The African Commission will look into the issue of the right to counsel of ones [sic] choice. This right\nas enshrined in Article 7(1) (c) of the African Charter122 is an important right which underpins several\nothers, such as freedom from ill-treatment and the right to prepare a defence.123 In the Principles and\nGuidelines on Fair Trial, the African Commission considered that in proceedings relating to criminal\ncharges, legal representation is the \"best means of legal defence against infringements of human rights\nand fundamental freedoms\".124 Such right to counsel applies during all stages of any criminal prosecution\n\"including preliminary investigations in which evidence is taken, periods of administrative detention, trial\nand appeal proceedings. Article 7 is explicit that the right is to counsel of the detainee or defendant's\nchoice. It comprises the right to timely and confidential consultations with that counsel.125 Where the\naccused either had no access, or only restricted or delayed access, to lawyers, the African Commission\nhas found a violation of Article 7.1(c)126 .\n210. In the instant case, none of the Victims had lawyers present at the critical early interrogation stage. It\nis submitted by the Complainants and not refuted by the Respondent State that on 23 November 2004 a\ngroup of human rights lawyers submitted a specific request to the Public Prosecutor's Office (registered\nunder number 16332) to legally represent a number of individuals, including the First Victim, whose names\nhad appeared in the local press as chief suspects in the Taba bombings' investigation. The lawyers\nreceived no response. The First Victim was denied representation at interrogations for a period of 5 months\nuntil 24 March 2005. The Second and Third Victims had no access to counsel until 26 March 2006, when\nthey first appeared in court.\n211. Moreover, even at the beginning of the trial, all three were denied the opportunity to consult with\ncounsel privately, in order to prepare their defence. The lawyer client communication, as alleged by the\nComplainants and not refuted by the Respondents, took place through bars of the court room, in the\npresence of and within earshot security officials. The African Commission therefore finds that the complete\ndenial of access to counsel before their appearance in court and the restrictive access thereafter violated\nthe right to counsel and the right to a defence (see below) under Article 7(1) (c).127\n212. Furthermore, in interpreting Article 7 of the African Charter, the African Commission has stated that\n\"any confession or other evidence obtained by any form of coercion or force may not be admitted as\nevidence or considered as probative of any fact at trial or in sentencing.\"128 In Malawi African Association\nV. Mauritania, this Commission has held that \"any confession or admission obtained during incommunicado\ndetention shall be considered to have been obtained by coercion.\"129\n213. These principles correspond with other international human rights norms, addressed in relation to\ntorture and ill-treatment, under which evidence and confessions obtained through torture or cruel, inhuman\nand degrading treatment, cannot be used in judicial proceedings apart from for the purpose of prosecuting\nthe act of torture or ill-treatment itself.130\n214. The African Commission makes reference to Article 15 of the Convention Against Torture (CAT). It\nalso notes that it has been accepted as inherent in international fair trial provisions comparable to Article 7\nof the African Charter. The European Court of Human Rights for example has held that \"the use of\nevidence obtained in violation of Article 3 [prohibition against torture or ill-treatment] in criminal proceedings\nraises serious issues as to the fairness of such proceedings. Incriminating evidence - whether in the form of\na confession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of\ntreatment which can be characterized as torture should never be relied on as proof of the victim's guilt,\n22\n\n\firrespective of its probative value.\"131\n215. It notes that the principle can also be found in the Egyptian Constitution of 1971 which stipulates that\n\"if a confession is proved to have been made by a person under any ...forms of duress or coercion, it shall\nbe considered invalid and futile\"132 .\n216. Thus, where an individual alleges that a confession has been obtained by torture or ill-treatment, the\nburden of proof then lies in this case on the state to demonstrate that the confession in question was freely\nmade. Although the Committee against Torture has affirmed in a number of cases that, \"it is for the author\nto demonstrate that her allegations are well founded\",133 it nevertheless stressed in P. E. v. France that, \"In\nthe light of the allegations that the statements at issue, which constituted, at least in part, the basis for the\nadditional extradition request, were obtained as a result of torture, the State party had the obligation to\nascertain the veracity of such allegations.\"134\n217. In a similar vein, the Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment, reviewing two national decisions that adopted a somewhat different approach to\nthe standard of proof question,135 noted as follows:\n\"[...] the applicant is only required to demonstrate that his or her allegations of torture are well founded. This\nmeans that the burden of proof to ascertain whether or not statements invoked as evidence in any\nproceedings, including extradition proceedings, have been made as a result of torture shifts to the State.136\n218. Accordingly, once a victim raises doubt as to whether particular evidence has been procured by\ntorture or ill-treatment, the evidence in question should not be admissible, unless the State is able to show\nthat there is no risk of torture or ill-treatment. Moreover, where a confession is obtained in the absence of\ncertain procedural guarantees against such abuse, for example during incommunicado detention, it should\nnot be admitted as evidence.\n219. The victims in this case all raised allegations of torture and ill-treatment. These allegations are at least\nconsistent with the circumstances of their case, such as the incommunicado nature of their detention and\nthe reports of the FMA which, at a minimum, indicate a risk of ill-treatment. Despite these concerns, the\n\"confessions\" were admitted as evidence and appear to have formed at least part of the basis of their\nconvictions and the imposition of the death penalty. The reliance on such evidence violates Article 7 of the\nCharter.\n220. The African Commission will now briefly address the matter of appeal. In this regard, the African\nCommission notes that Article 12 of the Egyptian Emergency Law stipulates that \"It is not allowed in any\nform to appeal the decisions pronounced by State Security Courts.\" This law, and its application in practice,\nviolate Article 7(1)(a) of the Charter, which provides for \"the right to an appeal to competent national organs\nagainst acts violating the fundamental rights as recognised and guaranteed by conventions, laws,\nregulations and customs in force.\"\n221. According to the Commission's Principles and Guidelines on Fair Trial, the right to appeal should be\nguaranteed in all States Parties and should provide \"a genuine and timely review of the case, including the\nfacts and the law\".137 The Commission has noted that States Parties should take steps to make appeals\nmandatory in death penalty cases, confirming the heightened importance of fair trial guarantees where life\nis at stake.138\n222. The importance of appeal rights is also reflected in the Commission's jurisprudence. In Law Office of\nGhazi Suleiman v. Sudan, the Commission held that \"the fact that the decisions of the military Court [was]\nnot subject to appeal [...] constitute[d] a de jure procedural irregularity.\"139 Concerning the right to appeal in\ndeath penalty cases, the Commission found that \"the foreclosure of any avenue of appeal to competent\nnational organs in a criminal case attracting punishment as severe as the death penalty clearly violates\n[Article 7(1)(a) of the Charter].\"140\n223. By denying the victims the right to appeal the decision of the Supreme State Security Emergency\nCourt, the Arab Republic of Egypt has violated Article 7(1) (a) of the African Charter. It should be noted\nthat the imposition of the death penalty is not per se unlawful under the Charter or broader international\nhuman rights law.\n224. The African Commission therefore concludes that the victims' rights under Article 7 (1) (a), (b) and (c)\nof the African Charter including their right to appeal, were violated.\n225. The African Commission will now analyse the submissions of the parties on Article 4 of the Charter.\n226. The Complainants aver that the imposition of the death penalty on the victims by a court, whose\ncomposition is illegal and unconstitutional, such as the Supreme State Security Emergency Court, violates\nthe victims' right to life and would amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.\n23\n\n\f227. The Respondent State argues that trial as well as procedures adopted in this case satisfied the\nrequirement of fair trial as guaranteed by international norms and standard. They stated that the trials were\ncarried out in public and in accordance with the assurances provided by the law. They also state that the\nvictims were represented by lawyers of their choice during trial.\n228. Article 4 of the African Charter provides that 'human beings are inviolable. Every human being shall be\nentitled to respect for his life and the integrity of his person. No one shall be arbitrary deprived of this right'.\n229. The victims were charged, inter alia, under Article 86 b (ii) and (iii) of the Egyptian Penal Code. This\nlaw provides that the punishment for the crimes specified in those provisions is death penalty where \"the\naction of the offender leads to the death of the victim of the crime\"141 or \"the crime which occurred was the\nobject of the efforts or intelligence /contacts or involvement in committing it.\"142\n230. The above law imposes a penalty on a particular crime in specified circumstances but did not provide\nan avenue for a competent judiciary to evaluate the appropriate penalty, in light of all of the circumstances\nof the case. The penalty is effectively mandated by law for certain categories of offences, with the President\nempowered to decide not to apply that sentence if he so decides. This is at odds with the requirements of\nright to life, as reflected in international legal practice.\n231. The African Commission in the case of International Pen and Others (on behalf of Saro-Wiwa) v\nNigeria143 took the view that the execution and implementation of a death sentence emanating from a trial\nwhich did not conform to Article 7 of the African Charter will amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.\nHaving held that the trial of the applicants offended Article 7 of the African Charter, it follows that any\nimplementation of the death sentence imposed on the applicants by the Supreme State Security\nEmergency courts will therefore amount to an arbitrary deprivation of life.\n232. However after careful consideration of Articles 7 and 26 and the wordings of Article 4, the African\nCommission is of the view that Article 4 of the Charter has not been violated. The victims are still under the\ncustody of the Respondent State, through a process that denied them due process and are not yet\nexecuted.\n\nHolding\n233. For these reasons, the African Commission holds as follows:\n(a) That the Respondent State - Republic of Egypt has violated the provisions of Articles 5, 7 (1) (a), (d)\nand 26 of the African Charter;\n(b) that there has been no violation of Article 4 of the African Charter;\n\nThe African Commission therefore calls on the Respondent State;\nI. Not to implement the death sentences;\nII. Calls on the Respondent State to adequately compensate the victims in line with international standard;\nIII. Reform the composition of the State Security Emergency Courts and ensure their independence;\nIV. Take measures to ensure that its law enforcement organs particularly the police respect the rights of\nsuspects detained in line with Article 5 of the Charter;\nV. Calls on the Respondent State to harmonize the State Security Emergency Laws with a view to bringing\nit in conformity with the Charter and other international legislations and regional norms and standards\nVI. Calls on the Respondent State to release the victims;\nVII. Calls on the Respondent State to submit the African Commission within 180 days from the date of\nreceipt of this decision (in line with Rule 112(2) of the African Commissions Rules of Procedure) on the\nmeasures taken to give effect to these recommendations.\n\nDone in Banjul this 9th Extra-Ordinary Session held From 23 February to 3 March 2011.\n\n24\n\n\fFootnotes\n*Editor's note: 87/93 is the number of a Constitution Rights Project v.
